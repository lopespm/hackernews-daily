								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I once took a critical thinking course and bought the textbook 2nd hand from the college bookstore.  A week or two in, I noticed half of a sentence written in the margin.  As the professor started teaching the topic from that page, he rhetorically asked a question, did not get an answer, and then answered himself with the sentence from the book.  I filliped ahead and found that the entire book was annotated with all of his answers, anecdotes, and various other helpful notes.  There was even a table that accurately listed his wardrobe choices!  The notes were in several different handwritings, and the book had been resold over a dozen times, so that professor must have been teaching the same class the exact same way for a decade or more.  I quickly became a star pupil as I always had an answer ready.  I added a few notes along the way and then sold it back to the bookstore at the end of the year.  I really wanted to keep it for posterity, but It just seemed wrong to take it out of circulation."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"In my middle school German textbook, I found the following note (translation my own):Hi Katie, we should meet up over tea over these images. The first image should be a simple sketch of two dudes playing football, tell the guys in graphics that the one they gave me is waaa too complex. The second image should be a chick playing tennis.The note went on in this manner for a couple more sentences, describing all the images on the page. Because I was a blind student who used a screen reader, I had to get the PDF version from the publishing company, which I then put in a specialized ebook reading app for the blind. I strongly suspect that the editors of that book used some PDF tricks for hiding information to post notes to each other. Whether they were alt descriptions, white fonts on white background, regions shrunk to be 1px tall by 1px wide or something else entirely, I do not know. That file was intended for printing, not digital distribution, so I guess that they decided the notes didn&#39;t need removing as long as they weren&#39;t visible."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; He looked around at the faces in the crowd and said, “I’m opening the bidding at one dollar.” I about shit myself. I bid the $1 immediately to get things rolling. Well, after I bid, he looked around and said, “Once, twice, sold that man there for $1.” I just laughed… and wondered how the Hell I was going to get this pallet home and what I was going to do with all those books.&gt; When I asked the auctioneer afterwards why he’d let it go so cheaply, he said, “Did you see anyone trampling you to get in a bid?” I said no, I didn’t. His reply, with a smirk on his face, was, “Gotta’ know your audience in this job.”&gt; Well, needless to say, I got the books home and spent a few years going through them and selling some, giving some away, etc. However, that’s not the point of this story. The point was finding things in books. So, with that in mind…Dude goes to an auction and finds books. Nobody bids on the books. Dude is amazed that the auctioneer is willing to sell him something nobody wants for a low price. Dude spends years going through those books.I&#39;m happy for this guy."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Hustle and grind. Create 7 streams of income. Work 18 hour days - anything less and you&#39;re a loser destined for mediocrity. Read 5 books a week. Start trading stocks and crypto. Take cold showers, hit the gym. Optimize your schedule, log every minute spent. Ditch your loser friends and only hang out with likeminded - success breeds success. Sigma grindset. Moon or bust. If you&#39;re not worth $1 million liquid before 30, cut off your finger and work even harder. Analyze your productivity and always look for places to cut fat."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The Jewish people have their Sabbath, as a hispanic person myself, we have our Siesta. I spent over a decade in the tech industry and I&#39;d literally be scoffed at for actually napping in a nap room or pod for 20min. Finally just started doing it in my car. But that&#39;s one of my practices that anchors me not only to my culture, but my Creator. It humbles me. And brings me joy. I hope everyone could find what their practice could be that would bring them this.Take some time, at least once a year, to sit down with yourself and have a vision for your life not based on work or status (ie vacations or the acquisition of things). If that isn&#39;t enough to snap you out, go to a small village in Latin America or maybe like Matthew McConaughey discovered and talked about in his book, a quaint monastery in New Mexico. Stay there until it makes sense.Most people want to be productive because they want to feel valued by others. But if you have to look to your own value from others, you&#39;ve already lost, and will continue to lose forever.Be. You. Slowly. and you&#39;ll find you&#39;re more valuable than you ever thought."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; Examples of productivity porn include but are not limited to: reading a tweet by a top VC about how to become a better startup founder; watching a Youtube video about the 7 mistakes you need to avoid at the gym; perusing a Hacker News thread about how to improve the code you write. All of these activities deceptively make you feel like you’ve done something productive. “I just learned something new”, you tell yourself.Those examples from the article make sense but in my experience the biggest illusion of productivity happens right inside our day to day work routines, namely email and chat systems. People respond to endless email threads that in the end trigger no action, endless discussions on Slack channels with no decision making until eventually somebody calls a meeting. We type and type but in the end we waste our own attention and our coworker’s attention just to feel important and productive without doing anything useful most of the time."</p>

But the breathless coverage of their work by news organizations, little more than rephrasing press releases, that&#39;s what irks me.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I just got access to the DALL-E 2 beta, and it&#39;s a ton of fun to make pictures out of everyday occurrences as prompts.Someone else here on HN observed that everyday people don&#39;t &#34;get&#34; how huge this all is. I experimented with asking random acquaintances at a local cafe for prompts and showed them the generated pictures. All but one person was totally unimpressed.If everything feels like magic, then what&#39;s one more piece of magic?This scared me more than the implications of DALL•E 2 itself specifically. People think of the technology in the world as mysterious black boxes that do inexplicable things, and they hence no longer understand relative complexity, progress, or change.My impression is that to most people DALL•E 2 is not &#34;substantially&#34; different to, say, Google Image search. Text in... image out. What&#39;s the big deal?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I’ve spent just over 1 week with DALL•E 2.Over the past 7 days I’ve generated ~1000 images, 150 of which were good enough to save. I only saved images which made me audibly gasp.Witnessing your own novel idea spring to life is a magical experience. DALL•E provides an artistic tool on a comparable level to digital photography, and by extension Photoshop.At this stage it’s 100% clear to me that DALL•E has heralded in a revolutionary new age of design. Every day I worked with it, I grew more confident in my outlook.It might not necessarily be an OpenAI product which truly “integrates” with humanity — but DALL•E has shown me that it’s possible… and just a matter of time."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Prompt crafting is quickly becoming an art. I just found out yesterday that there&#39;s actually market places for buying and selling prompts [0]. It can really make a big difference if you can tune the image by adding the right words. Midjourney [1] even allows things such as adjusting the weight of each keyword or how &#34;literal&#34; the AI should take your prompt.[0] https://promptbase.com/[1] https://midjourney.gitbook.io/docs/user-manual"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"PHP has so many hidden benefits:- it&#39;s stateless by design (much easier to scale)- it was &#34;serverless&#34; before Serverless- surprisingly performant- no &#34;unknown unknowns&#34;. it&#39;s so tried-and-true, there&#39;s no surprises- deployment is so simple, just drop a file on a web server. No middleware needed.- No long compile times because there is no compiling needed.EDIT: why the downvotes? If you don&#39;t agree, just reply so we can have a healthy dialogue.EDIT2: I also think there is something unique about PHP documentation. It has plenty of real life examples, and the ability for users to leave comments allows you to hear directly from others &#34;gotchas&#34; that people have experienced. I feel like PHP documentation is very undervalued."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; I love legacy codebases.&gt; A legacy codebase means that the product is performing well. It means that I can often make immediate and impactful improvements.Wow. This person must have worked on very different legacy codebases than me.Legacy Javascript code, to me, is something that I do not want to touch with a 10 foot pole, because every little piece of it can be intertwined with and used by many other hidden places. Plus, I&#39;ve never found a legacy JS codebase that has a robust test suite, so any refactoring I do can be hard to test and verify.From a practicality perspective, I get that the best programming language is the one you can use to build your product, but I tend to long for languages like C# or even Go when I&#39;m trying to deliver a product on a team with 10+ people. Static typing really helps when you&#39;re interfacing with someone elses code, and Typescript only aids this point.Maybe if your target audience is genuinely 10 year olds learning to code, fine. But also if you&#39;re building a serious product for a company, please don&#39;t choose a &#34;Janky programming language&#34; because I really don&#39;t want to have to debug it after you left before really thinking about sanitizing user input.I feel like, in the hands of a really talented programmer, they can be super productive in PHP or Javascript or really anything. But I&#39;ve just had a lot of bad experiences with quickly written, undocumented code."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This really speaks to my heart. I learned programming as a young kid when my uncle taught my pascal. But I just couldn&#39;t see the point of console programs and never really got into it. Eventually I picked up late 90s HTML (hello geocities!) and php was a natural next step. I still remember going to the library to borrow the book PHP and MySQL web development. It was so empowering. I could make any kind of application I wanted and see the result in my browser, GUI and all (Win32 API was way beyond me at that age). I made my own forums, ebay clone, and a few web apps for an old Korean MMO.Fast forward a few decades, and things look very different. Tons of web app backends being written in go, nodeJS/TS, and I recently learned people write them in rust+webasm. It&#39;s just crazy to me. I&#39;ve worked on FOSS projects that are massively over-complicated because of their platform/language choice, when they would&#39;ve been very straightforward php choices. But php still has this weird stigma about it despite most of the old concerns having been addressed.I do have to say, though, that front end web development is way better than before with the advent of React and co, webpack, css libraries etc. Doing all that html/js/css by hand was always painful."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Bravo! I&#39;m so glad this is born. I&#39;m curious about its model, SalesForce CodeGen. Does it train on all the public repos on GitHub? Does Copilot have access to private repos that CodeGen cannot access?Also, it would be really cool if I can personalize FauxPilot by feeding it with all my repos on GitHub. Sometimes I just need to reimplement a function I&#39;ve written before but it&#39;s really hard to find where my old code is."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Tangential, maybe someone here knows; how complicated would be to implement an autocompleter that just understands syntax + patterns and can offer me suggestions but based on my own stuff? Like what is the simplest version of Copilot that doesn&#39;t require huge amounts of training but just does a decent job at recognizing tokens and trying to fill in the structure based on some input code. e.g: `app.get(&#39;/&#39;,|`  &lt;- at this point I should get an express.js handler autocomplete like `(req, res, next) =&gt; {}`, maybe with multiple choices grepped from my own data ranked by occurences. Is this too extreme it needs a multibillion parameter AI model to achieve? Does anything like this exist? Like an auto-snippet thing but contextual and token replacing."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Awesome work, I made a similar project which is making a cost effective and privacy focused alternative to OpenAI text generation that can be switched to in a one line/easy way because it&#39;s API compatible https://text-generator.io/blog/over-10x-openai-cost-savings-... also works for generating code too so would be excited for someone to try that out too."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"There is plenty of room for all of Chess.com, Chess24 and Lichess to exist.Lichess has the best platform to play on and is free to use.Chess.com is a business. As such they want to earn money.
However, without a large, online chess community there will be no subscribers.
The amount of effort chess.com has made to sponsor events, streamers etc.
is tremendous.Making a living as a chess professional is tough. 
Streaming/YouTube has opened the field somewhat: it is no longer
required to be in the world top 20 to make a living in the field of chess.The Chess24 initiative is without doubt inspired by Chess.com.
Chess24 gives yet another way for chess players to earn money.
Via Chessable (owneed by Chess24) players can sell chess online book/booklets.If Hikaru has a clause in his contract with Chess.com, that he can&#39;t play on Lichess - then the just can&#39;t play on Lichess. That&#39;s simple.Would Nike be happy if Portugal’s Cristiano Ronaldo suddenly appeared in Adidas shoes?It works the other way too: Wen did you last see Magnus play on Chess.com?
[I am aware that Magnus as owner/investor in Chess24 makes his own rules - and plays on Lichess]"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Paying off Chess streamers is pretty much the only way Chess.com can keep people using their site. Their product is simply inferior in every way, except for their library of master lessons, and all these GMs exclusively streaming through Chess.com.I figure all this spending on sponsorship and GM content is why the rest of their site is so inferior to Lichess. Lichess can spend all their time perfecting the platform, and it really shows."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Chess has always had this dichotomy over free/paid services. (a bit not unlike programming tools).I love lichess.org but make no mistake: without the dedication of one talented Scala programmer willing to underpay themselves that site would not exist.Commercial sites can provide more services and offer more opportunities to chess professionals simply due to the funding model.Disclaimer: I&#39;ve played over 100k online chess games since 1992. Starting with original ICS (client was on Xwindows) before ICS/FICS split drama, then chessbase.com, then chess.com and now lichess.org. I slightly prefer lichess but play on chess.com as well."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I really like this trend of &#34;making the terminal great again&#34;. Between rich/textual in python and lipgloss/bubble tea for golang, this turns cmd from &#34;the default ugly stuff that is easy to produce&#34; into &#34;something fun and pretty&#34;.Also note that those projects have the (not anymore) secret goal to also produce a web app from the same code base automatically.I imagine native will follow, or wasm, or something. Nevertheless, having the terminal as the smallest denominator for UI makes a lot of sense for small utilities. You won&#39;t build the next Figma with it but a lot of scripts could benefit from that."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The advice to use lru_cache is good.But there is an issue if lru_cache is used on methods, like in the example given in the article:1. When lru_cache is used on a method, `self` is used as a part of cache key. That&#39;s good, because there is a single cache for all instances, and using self as a part of the key allows not to share data between instances (it&#39;d be incorrect in most cases).2. But: because `self` is a part of a key, a reference to `self` is stored in the cache.3. If there is a reference to Python object, it can&#39;t be deallocated. So, an instance can&#39;t be deallocated until the cache is deallocated (or the entry is expired) - if a lru_cache&#39;d method is called at least once.4. Cache itself is never deallocated (well, at least until the class is destroyed, probably at Python shutdown). So, instances are kept in memory, unless the cache is over the size limit, and all entries for this instance are purged.I think there is a similar problem in the source code as well, e.g. https://github.com/Textualize/textual/blob/4d94df81e44b27fff... - a DirectoryTree instance won&#39;t be deallocated if its render_tree_label method is called, at least until new cache records push out all the references to this particular instance.It may be important or not, depending on a situation, but it&#39;s good to be aware of this caveat. lru_cache is not a good fit for methods unfortunately."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"One of my proudest moments during the development of &#34;Linux on the Web&#34; had to be the creation of a Terminal application (try it at https://lotw.site/shell) that can render its output with near-native efficiency. My initial attempt was based on placing character images, one-by-one, onto a canvas element, but it was horribly sluggish. Then I started playing around with a &#34;Virtual Dom&#34; (React-like) approach, wherein I convert the underlying data structure into an html string, and then set the innerHTML property of a div element, for every time the screen has to be redrawn. (Source code: https://github.com/linuxontheweb/LOTW/blob/main/root/code/ap..., the relevant code is the &#34;render&#34; function starting on line 569, and the innerHTML is set on line 940).I don&#39;t know how many years its been that I started working on the Terminal application, but it was only within the past week or so that I &#34;bit the bullet&#34; and figured out how to do finger pad/mouse wheel scrolling of the output buffer (See the &#39;main.onwheel&#39; function in the source code for that little tidbit!). Since I required fine-grained control over the rendering process, I could not rely on the &#34;naive&#34; way of doing scrolling on the web (which is to simply let the browser take care of the entire process)."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I have worked at both startups and tech companies 40+ years old, and the conclusion I&#39;ve come to from my anecdata is that every engineer at every company is swamped all the time.Feature requests and bug reports are easy. Writing features and fixing bugs is hard. Your todo list will always grow faster than you can tackle items. Once a senior engineer retired, and I inherited about a hundred of his bugs out of the 600 or so he left behind.It&#39;s a marathon, not a sprint. Working at a consistent pace is better than burning yourself out. The work is omnipresent. It will never stop growing. It will consume all if you let it.Unless you&#39;re at an early-stage startup, let your manager deal with your giant and ever-growing todo list. Let someone more plugged-in to the business side deal with prioritizing, and focus on technical excellence. Unless you aspire to management yourself, that&#39;s already plenty to do.Anyone who tells you every engineer needs to be in touch with every business concern either only works on early-stage projects or is part of a hustle culture that I don&#39;t ascribe to. I don&#39;t have the energy for technical excellence and knowing everything about the business."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I just talked about this with my wife just yesterday about her peer. If you&#39;re always the hero to take on too much work and you never keep up, you invite various significant structural problems.You&#39;re too useful to remove, you may not get attention for corrective measures because of fear of the person leaving.You are often too swamped to effectively get work done smoothly and in an expedient manner.You become a single point of failure (bus factor 1) so that when you take a vacation / hit by a bus, the company suffers significantly.A common personality trait of these types of people seem to be self reliance / control seekers. When they own that authority of work, they are less likely to accept delegation to get them out of their woes.In general, these types of employees may end up being labeled super stars, but they&#39;re also potential albatrosses that could significantly wound a company if not properly managed."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;ve been on both sides. A lot of people say people who want to be swamped is a control problem but I&#39;ve found its more delicate than that. My circumstances require me to have decent insurance so my life will forever be tied to an employer. I don&#39;t really get an &#34;escape&#34; at least until obamacare becomes cheaper than $2800/mo. for what I need in order to try out the entrepreneur life.As a result I work very hard. I end up getting a lot of work done, and thus more work on my plate. This is often manageable and I use this as a gauge of my probability of being fired for any given reason. Someone knocking on the door of a PIP likely won&#39;t be getting as much work especially if it&#39;s reasonably complicated. It&#39;s been my experience as work starts to die down to a less-than-consistent level I&#39;m usually out the door (never fired, but often laid off in this industry).However, this burned me when I became staff-level because I&#39;d get so much work that despite trying to reduce the bus factor back to &#34;manageable chaos&#34; I was unable to and ended up leaving the job for another one because I became the smart guy in the room.But overall I aim to walk the razors edge between swamped and normal at all times because it&#39;s the only form of security I have. When I am in this condition I am now useful enough I have plenty of power over my employer and my position and for an employee this is an ideal situation to have. Especially when the alternative is extremely expensive &#34;between jobs&#34; insurance, or a less than ideal insurance package from another company."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Yep, there&#39;s a premium on making your architecture more cloudy. However, the best point for Use One Big Server is not necessarily running your big monolithic API server, but your database.Use One Big Database.Seriously. If you are a backend engineer, nothing is worse than breaking up your data into self contained service databases, where everything is passed over Rest/RPC. Your product asks will consistently want to combine these data sources (they don&#39;t know how your distributed databases look, and oftentimes they really do not care).It is so much easier to do these joins efficiently in a single database than fanning out RPC calls to multiple different databases, not to mention dealing with inconsistencies, lack of atomicity, etc. etc. Spin up a specific reader of that database if there needs to be OLAP queries, or use a message bus. But keep your OLTP data within one database for as long as possible.You can break apart a stateless microservice, but there are few things as stagnant in the world of software than data. It will keep you nimble for new product features. The boxes that they offer on cloud vendors today for managed databases are giant!"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Our industry summarized:Hardware engineers are pushing the absolute physical limits of getting state (memory/storage) as close as possible to compute. A monumental accomplishment as impactful as the invention of agriculture and the industrial revolution.Software engineers: let&#39;s completely undo all that engineering by moving everything apart as far as possible. Hmmm, still too fast. Let&#39;s next add virtualization and software stacks with shitty abstractions.Fast and powerful browser? Let&#39;s completely ignore 20 years of performance engineering and reinvent...rendering. Hmm, sucks a bit. Let&#39;s add back server rendering. Wait, now we have to render twice. Ah well, let&#39;s just call it a &#34;best practice&#34;.The mouse that I&#39;m using right now (an expensive one) has a 2GB desktop Electron app that seems to want to update itself twice a week.The state of us, the absolute garbage that we put out, and the creative ways in which we try to justify it. It&#39;s like a mind virus.I want my downvotes now."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; However, cloud providers have often had global outages in the past, and there is no reason to assume that cloud datacenters will be down any less often than your individual servers.A nice thing about being in a big provider is when they go down a massive portion of the internet goes down, and it makes news headlines. Users are much less likely to complain about your service being down when it&#39;s clear you&#39;re just caught up in the global outage that&#39;s affecting 10 other things they use."</p>

Iterate, iterate, iterate.It seems like the most valuable thing this could do is get some of that early exploration out of the way faster and easier than a human can do it, get to two or three concepts that feel like they’re in the neighborhood, and then let a human expert take over and turn it to something final quality. That’s pretty cool."</p>

Octopus is originally Greek, not Latin and thus does not get the Latin plural -i, but instead would get the Greek plural -odes. Since it ends in a way English can deal with, the commonly accepted usage is octopuses (English) over octopodes (Greek) with octopi being the least correct.https://qz.com/1446229/let-us-finally-resolve-the-octopuses-..."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I find this stuff fascinating, and this article is way above average for online posts about proprietary/algorithmic/quantitative/low-latency trading (very leaky Venn diagram there). I have a few nitpicks but overall it&#39;s informative and it&#39;s an interesting format: viewing an industry through the lens of a particular firm, especially one as fascinating as Jane. Anything that develops literacy in modern finance amongst the lay public is a good thing in my book.If this stuff floats your boat I&#39;d also recommend any of Carl Cook&#39;s talks, e.g. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NH1Tta7purM. Optiver is AFAIK in a somewhat different business than Jane, but they&#39;re also players (or were last I had any inside baseball).Too many people got their worldview on this industry from &#34;Flash Boys&#34;, and I say this as a Lewis fan, is criminally stupid at best and in bad faith at worst (if you want a well-researched, accessible alternative: https://www.amazon.com/Trading-Speed-Light-Algorithms-Transf... is about a zillion times better).It&#39;s a pretty short list of places I&#39;d ever go through some grueling and semi-arbitrary gauntlet to work for, but Jane is on it for sure.I hope the author(s) do Medallion next."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt;the winners get a job from which people routinely retire rich in their 30s, and the losers... don&#39;tHonestly, I find this ridiculous. Firstly, Yes, working at Jane Street is a well paying job and you&#39;ll do well out of it. No. People aren&#39;t routinely retiring in their 30s. I don&#39;t understand where this absurd idea comes from. Look at all the rich people in the world, look at how old they are, and ask, are they retired? No! People who are driven and smart don&#39;t suddenly earn their first $5m go off and buy an annuity. They&#39;re more likely to go off and found their own trading shop at 30 than they are to retire.Secondly, you know what happens to people who don&#39;t get hired after their internship at Jane Street? They go to HRT, to G Research, to Jump, to Citadel, to Optiver, to IMC, to XTX, if they&#39;re really unsuccessful they&#39;ll go to Google, Microsoft, Amazon, Meta. These are not people desperate for a job."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Generally good article that delves into how a market maker functions. Couple points:Re EA: quoting my boss, EA isn&#39;t really a dominant thing in the market maker space, it&#39;s pretty much only espoused by a couple high profile individuals (mainly, SBF).Re strategy: point about how there&#39;s little strategy involved in being a market maker is off-base. Everything is ultimately strategy: do I continue to pour resources into a strategy that is losing money in the hopes of eventually seeing pnl? What markets should I focus on? What is the best use of time for each employee that maximizes pnl/head? etc etcOne thing that I thought article got right is that most work involved in market making is about avoiding trades, not making them. Capturing the bid ask spread is conceptually easy. The hard part is avoiding trading with toxic counterparties.Part about put options is especially apt. Market making during a crash / recession (like right now) is especially difficult because all the non-toxic counterparties have stopped trading as much (people like to trade a lot more during a bull market than a bear one). By setting up a structure such that you profit during a crash (either by buying puts, leaning net short, or through some other method), you introduce an uncorrelated return stream that can really help."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"The truth is that a majority of tech companies don&#39;t need 50%+ of their employees.Google could lay off vast swathes tomorrow and be immensely more profitable without any loss in revenue.The 2010s will be remembered as the golden era for tech employment. The second we start getting industry wide layoffs, the insanely high wage inflation we&#39;ve seen will kick into reverse much faster than you probably believe possible.Further, tech employees will be the first to suffer in a high inflation environment due to rising discount rate. Yet tech is such a small portion of the labor force that layoffs here basically mean zilch when it comes to the unemployment rate/inflation, and thus there&#39;s a long way for it to fall before the Fed adjusts policy"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"That&#39;s brutal.  We just laid off a couple hundred people last week, only five from our department (which is 190 people) but two of them were from one of my teams.  Demoralizing, and in the case of that team, absolutely devastating to productivity in the short term.Cutting almost 1 in 4 employees is beyond anything I can imagine.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The people I know who are still inside (Google) seem optimistic that maybe the company is taking a pause to deal with some of its bureaucracy and internal politics issues and with people&#39;s complaints about perf. I suppose that&#39;s good.From my perspective: They&#39;ve got way too many people doing a lot of meh work and feeling really ... important about it. And it&#39;s on the whole asphyxiating the industry."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; As several of these statements blatantly contradict one another, I went back to the data and ran the same sanity check that I did with Facebook above. In other words, what if Google is using the hiring freeze as a smoke screen and only continuing with the strongest candidates, while keeping the rest on the bench?An actual hiring freeze sends a very strong negative signal to employees and investors. To employees it says &#34;the ship is sinking.&#34; Layoffs are right around the corner and that is absolute poison to morale. To investors it says &#34;technical or not, we&#39;ve hit a recession.&#34; Brace yourselves for impact. Google and Facebook are both advertising companies, so they are tightly coupled to the business cycle. When business spending starts to falter, they&#39;ll feel it first. And they have.So it&#39;s not surprising that the companies themselves are far from clear about this, sending mixed messages. I expect them to continue to do so for as long as they possibly can.The bubble has inflated so far for so long, I get the sense that even among cynical young employees and &#34;investors&#34; there&#39;s a sense of permanence in the positions of both companies. The thing is, those with fewer than 10 years experience have never seen the ferocity of the other side of the business cycle. When it turns, that mofo turns. Those in top management positions have seen it, and they&#39;re going to do everything in their ability to deny and evade it."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Google has always recruited and interviewed independently of whether they actually have roles open that make sense for you. Earlier this year, I passed the interview and spent six weeks in &#34;team match&#34; before I gave up and took a role with another company. Had a friend who did the same for months for a PM role.Just bc you&#39;re getting contacted by Google recruiters this week or interviewing doesn&#39;t mean you&#39;ll ever find a team or get a real offer."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"It&#39;s interesting to see that they also adopted the current industry standard of automatically banning people at random, not telling them why and not giving them any way to rectify it. But then, well, I mean, it&#39;s Oracle. What did you expect?Normally something like this would put them on my &#34;will never use any of their products nor work with them&#34; shitlist, but it&#39;s Oracle, so they were already there since, like, ever.Also, obligatory: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-zRN7XLCRhc&amp;t=33m"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I have a similar experience. Recently my account got suspended for no reason. I have been logging in and reading up on the tutorials / documentation to see how to use Oracle Cloud and I hadn&#39;t even started using any of the free resources yet, but my recently created account got suspended nonetheless. Unless my account was hacked (which I would like to be notified of) I cannot have violated any ToS. I got the same non-response when I asked why my account was removed.To me it looks like Oracle isn&#39;t being honest about their &#34;always free&#34; tier and they just shut down non-paying accounts to cut costs if they don&#39;t foresee them converting into paying customers any time soon. If it were a bug / mistake, then I would have expected better support (restoring the account or providing a new account if that&#39;s not possible), but being ghosted by a big corporation when you know for a fact that you did nothing wrong is pretty frustrating.I have not had such a bad experience with any cloud company ever. I sincerely hope Oracle changes, but as it stands I will never spend a dime with Oracle and I will dissuade anyone from using their services, because of how unreliable they have demonstrated themselves to be."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Looking in the implementation of the Python version of ABC[0], you&#39;ll see that `__subclasshook__` doesn&#39;t do any language magic, it just registers the method to be called in `__instancecheck__`. So if you just implement `__instancecheck__` directly, you get the same behavior, but without the caching around it.  class OneWayMeta(type):
      seen_classes = set()
  
      @classmethod
      def __instancecheck__(cls, instance):
          C = instance.__class__
          print(f&#34;trying {C}&#34;)

      f(&#34;abc&#34;)
      f([1, 2, 3])
      f(&#34;efg&#34;)


When running:  trying &lt;class &#39;str&#39;&gt;
  abc is a new class
  trying &lt;class &#39;list&#39;&gt;
  [1, 2, 3] is a new class
  trying &lt;class &#39;str&#39;&gt;
  we&#39;ve seen efg&#39;s class before


Am I missing a particular point the article is making, or did the author overlook this?[0]: https://github.com/python/cpython/blob/main/Lib/_py_abc.py"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Reading this I can&#39;t help feeling that Python puts the &#34;simplicity&#34; in all the places that don&#39;t matter. Simplicity is the reason given for not having useful language features like pattern matches as expressions, or lambdas with multiple expressions, but I&#39;ve never seen these features[1] cause problems in other languages. And then we have this... Surely semantic simplicity is the simplicity that actually matters, but the way the simplicity argument is used in Python is often to enforce arbitrary syntactic and semantic complexity.[1] It&#39;s almost ridiculous to call these features as they&#39;re just a consequence of the underlying language model. E.g. if you have expression blocks you have lambdas with multiple expressions with no extra work."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"  &gt; But surely Python clamps down on this chicanery, right?
  &gt; 
  &gt; $ py10 abc.py
  &gt; 10 is not iterable
  &gt; string is iterable
  &gt; [1, 2, 3] is iterable
  &gt; 
  &gt; Oh.
  &gt; 
  &gt; Oh my.

I&#39;m sure I&#39;m being dense and missing the obvious but ... what is the author responding to here? What&#39;s wrong or bad?"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I&#39;m a 50+ greybeard (literally) and here&#39;s my story: I once figured I could improve my chances of getting a job if I shave my beard. I knew I looked much younger without it, people would get my age wrong by some 10-15 years. And so my 6 months-long search for a job that time ended in success on the first interview after I shaved it. The first one! I remember the faces of the guys who hired me when they saw my personal data on some tax form that I filled later, after the contract was signed.Ageism in this industry is real. I think the root cause of it is investors, it&#39;s where the origins of this phenomenon are. They prefer younger entrepreneurs who in turn hire people like themselves, and so it propagates down the hierarchy as the company grows. It&#39;s transitive. In fact this is true for all types of discrimination.I switched to entrepreneurship and feel the same effects here. Good luck raising money or even finding a co-founder. It&#39;s tough. Not going to shave my beard though.I have no idea what could be done here other than for the aging tech people to unite and form their own companies, investment funds. Just like the other discriminated groups do - women, then racial and other minorities.Edit: I should add, I was talking about a hands-on engineering job, not management. I love coding and not going to quit it because of ageism or pay or other circumstances."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I know agism is rampant in this industry, but it still shocks me. I&#39;m 23 and relatively junior at ~1YOE. The &#34;grey beards&#34; I&#39;ve worked with have all been incredibly technically proficient and a joy to work with.The skill and ability and depth of experience held by my older coworkers makes me grateful to have the opportunity to work with and learn from them.To any older individuals here still working in tech, please don&#39;t feel unwanted. Your experience is needed and appreciated, especially by the juniors who get to work with you."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"My thoughts: It keeps getting better and better.You stop reinventing wheels. You know where most of the holes are and
can laugh when the kids fall in them. You know the hype cycles and can
spot the fads and fashions. With 10 or 20 languages behind you, code
becomes separate and &#39;above&#39; languages, so you can think in structures
and abstract algorithms. Enjoy standing up for principles, you&#39;re the
man now, and there&#39;s not much left to &#34;look up to&#34; (especially in this
morally declining business). Not having something to prove means you
can know your limits, like when to quit trying to fix someone&#39;s &#34;poor
little thing with a broken wing&#34; that ain&#39;t ever gonna fly. You&#39;ve
time to read all four volumes of Knuth and really (almost)
understand. Also, you&#39;re not going to win that Turing award now, so
enjoy not having to try.Things to watch out for.Look after your eyesight and posture. Spend more time thinking about
code while out walking. Shout at clouds less because you realise that
dumb ideas will die of their own accord in good time. Enjoy the new
toys the kids make, even if they aren&#39;t &#34;production ready serious&#34; -
they will mature in time."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Part of why it is so difficult is that these C-level executives have mastered the art of sounding good with minimal set of accomplishments. Sometimes I listen to these presentations and it feels like a solid story and presentation, but there is nothing behind their rodeo when you sit back and dig deeper. A fucking mirage.It&#39;s not the person who does excellent work that gets promoted or climb up the corporate ladder, but the person who knows how to sell their work, as sad as this is."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I worked for a large, late stage, Softbank backed company. They brought in some C-suite execs while I was there. A CTO paid several million annually with large, public company experience. They were totally clueless, and the engineering org was almost revolting within 6 months, trying to stage a coup to the CEO. No technical experience, no leadership, installing cronies, speaking in opaque platitudes.I&#39;m not angry about it, though they did oversee us being on the cusp of a promising IPO to a pretty bad outcome that cost me a lot of money, but I&#39;ll say that any illusion that you have to be competent to be a C-suite exec, and any imposter syndrome I ever had, went out the window after that. Ironically it increased my personal confidence, if these idiots can do it I certainly can.I think the old saying &#34;nobody gets fired for buying IBM&#34; kinda applies to some execs maybe, like nobody gets fired for hiring some stellar resume exec with lots of experience, but they may get fired for taking a chance on an upstart."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"That&#39;s because you shouldn&#39;t hire them but you should grow them internally. Outside hires for executive positions are usually a great way to de-stabilize your company, early hires tend to be loyal to the founders and if you then hire some &#39;suit&#39; to sit between them and you you risk them breaking off.So the solution to this problem is to ensure that your early hires are all top notch with the potential to eventually build out to become your C-suite, and to treat them as generously as you can when it comes to equity.And if you&#39;re really smart you stick to that mantra: hire quality over quantity, it will allow you to push back the typical organizational struggles until you&#39;ve achieved an order of magnitude or more in revenues (assuming product market fit)."</p>

There&#39;s even a show about them[0], Starring Number One.I can&#39;t access the gMail account I set up, because I made a mistake, when setting the password, and did not save the one I used.It will not allow me to access the account I set up.After a while, I just gave up.

								<p class="story__comment_others">"About a decade ago, a broken iPhone caused me to experience how bad Google&#39;s MFA reset process was — there were multiple _years_ where the “hard landing” form triggered a flow which sent an email to an internal mailbox which didn&#39;t exist! — and while I was able to use printed backup codes after I returned home the experience left me concerned enough that I went to one of their identity group&#39;s public meetings here in DC.One of the things which I was struck by was how unseriously they appeared to view their role in modern life. People were generally very casual about the need and were especially uninterested in anything which required them to work with outside parties.My suggestion was that they consider a protocol where trusted civic authorities could be allowed to confirm someone&#39;s identity, which sounds like it would be useful for this case: let the person initiate a mediated reset flow where someone like a librarian, police officer, etc. could authenticate in their official capacity and check a box saying that they&#39;ve confirmed the photo ID for the person standing in front of them. Most of the benefits from MFA are preventing things like phishing attacks which are also stymied by limiting it to people in your geographic area, although you might want to disable this for high-risk people enrolled in Google&#39;s Advanced Protection Program."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Perhaps the solution is for libraries or local authorities to setup their own email providers. An email address “for life” with your library card, with the necessary support and in-person reset verification that their patrons need. I’m not suggesting this would be an easy or inexpensive undertaking, but maybe that’s just the next step in service evolution for a public information service like a library group."</p>

I&#39;ve had success with:- setting long passwords to social media that aren&#39;t autofilled (saved in bitwarden) and logging out after each session- nerfing addicting parts of webapps (plugins which block the facebook news feed but allow messaging/groups helped a TON)- forbidding dedicated social media apps and only using &#34;worse&#34; internet sites- router DNS blockers, even if I can get around them, the act of having to bypass it raises my awareness I&#39;m doing something subpar for myself"</p>

How am I supposed to stay informed about important topics without the news? How do I know how to help people in need without knowing what’s going on?

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Well this is... eerie. I just released Stictionary[1] on Friday.It is an offline, ad free, dictionary that remembers words you look up. It gives a word of the day and provides (admittedly underfeatured atm) flashcards to review your word lists. It includes optional syncing to keep your word lists across devices. I&#39;ve been holding off posting about it while i complete the website[2].Love to see someone else had such a similar idea. Great confirmation of the unmet need in the space. Really awesome execution as well. Congrats on the launch!On a personal note, i built Stictionary after tracking all the words i looked up manually for years. Now i have an app that does it for me (and was a blast to build).1: https://apps.apple.com/us/app/stictionary/id1613214660?platf...2: https://www.stictionary.com/"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Actually, iOS already has built-in support for dictionary and thesaurus. In any native text input field, select a word and choose Define or Look Up. The choice of dictionary is customizable; I usually choose New Oxford American Dictionary and Oxford Dictionary of English (not to be confused with the venerable Oxford English Dictionary). They are high quality dictionaries. They are basically the same except that the pronunciation for the latter is in IPA which I&#39;m more used to.When I need to look up a word, I create a new note from control center, type in the word, double tap to bring up the contextual menu and then the dictionary.It pretty much checks all the boxes. For distraction-free reading, turn off &#34;Content from Apple&#34; in the Siri settings to avoid those obnoxious Siri knowledge panels."</p>

The language means nothing, the principles mean nothing.

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Note these are bail conditions (so presumably an alternative to a much more constrained existence in prison) for a charge that indicates potential for inflicting severe economic damage after organization via communication devices.When compared to bail conditions for other charged crimes which may also be strict and context-related (eg. trackers or keeping distance from a victim of violence) it sounds tough (and right to be strictly monitored under rights laws) but not necessarily unreasonable.Is it wrong/excessive/draconian? Possibly. But I don&#39;t think a knee-jerk assumption that it is any of those things is appropriate."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I have a (thankfully mild) inherited retina disorder. If you read the part about lasers and eye damage it’s basically that, but the “lasers” are faulty genes rather than anything external causing the eye damage. And I can verify that at first my brain did an incredibly good job at error-correcting over it, but in the last couple years it’s finally been able to “peek through”. One day I was hiking and suddenly had black spots in my vision. Then after that I woke up one morning and noticed large black halos in my vision that went away after a couple seconds of being awake. A couple weeks later and I started getting flashing visual artifacts in the edge of my vision.Which is/was terrifying because I didn’t know this was a multi-decade process I was just becoming aware of and instead assumed that if I just noticed this much visual degradation in a couple weeks then surely I’ll be completely blind in a couple more?  Thankfully that’s not how it works, the damage has been increasing at a slow steady constant, it’s just that the processes in place to correct for said damage do a _really_ good job at hiding it, until they don’t, so the rate of degradation seems much worse than it actually is.That said, please if you notice any new visual artifacts get them checked up on _immediately_, while my case is a slow genetic issue sometimes it’s a detached retina, which can happen for any number of reasons and can usually be reversed quite easily with surgery if caught early.  I was “lucky” mine was genetic rather than physical trauma, since I didn’t go see someone until things got noticeably worse."</p>

This shaved tons off of my bundles (unfortunately have some libraries we rely on that are both substantial but old)Another one is library deduping.

You could compress pages, kinda like ZFS compresses blocks, and still maintain random access, and get pretty close to whole-file compression."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Somewhat surprisingly, Linux support for Apple Silicon MacBooks seems to be shaping up to be better than that for pretty much any other laptop. The Asahi team don’t have support for everything yet (notably no GPU) but what they do have support for seems to be high quality, well integrated with Linux’s conventions, and upstreamed into the mainline kernel! How much other hardware can claim that?The Asahi developers have also stated that Apple tends to keep hardware peripheral interfaces stable across generations (they speculate that this is to keep things easy for their own OS dev teams), and that this has so far proven to be true for M2 (and several iPhone generations before that), and thus once support is available , it should stay relevant for some time.Given this, it seems like MacBooks could easily end up becoming the laptop of choice for Linux developers in the years to come."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Call me crazy but I think long term (10 years +) the Intel strategy of fabricating chips domestically is the correct choice. There&#39;s a ton of geopolitical pressure in this direction. The US simply doesn&#39;t want to be dependent on Taiwan for chips, for obvious reasons.Intel knows this and is trying to become the TSMC of the west. And frankly they&#39;re the only ones that can pull it off. I&#39;d be surprised if 10 years from now the majority of their revenue comes from selling processors rather than fabricating them for AMD, NVIDIA, etc. Why compete when there&#39;s plenty of steak for everyone?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I had invested in AMD when Lisa Su took over as CEO. I had been keeping tabs on the company for some time. Unfortunately I needed money to cover my basic living expenses and had to sell all my shares about a year later. Even at the time, it was painful because I had spent a lot of time researching AMD and I was very optimistic about Lisa Su based on her background and her tenacity.I could have made maybe 20x on my investment... Still, I don&#39;t feel regret. You can only regret things if you had a choice and I know that there&#39;s no way I could have avoided selling those shares."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"So I&#39;m very much in camp AMD.  But, market cap has proven over and over again to be kind of bogus. E.g. do we really think Tesla is actually worth more than the rest of the top 10 or so automakers?"</p>

I actually wasn&#39;t the only one who noticed (https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/microsoft-bing/what-h...)I think I know why: the Bing blog implies that most of it was the passion project of a couple of summer interns in 2015.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Great job!I can sort of relate. I worked on an infrastructure system, almost entirely alone, for ten years, before it was finally taken over by a capable team, and I was able to step away, and it took on a life of its own. It is now a worldwide standard, used daily, by thousands.I say “sort of,” because it was never something I planned to make money on. It filled a need. Also, and it’s a long story, I had to weather a fairly hefty level of abuse during that time. The demographics of the target user base were … challenging.It’s all good, now.One thing all that time brought me, was a really high-Quality product. Lots of time to squash bugs, and iterate the UX."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Nice project. I can relate in that I have my own personal hobby project that I have been working on for years and I would like to get many more users trying it out.Mine is a new kind of data management system that can manage unstructured, structured, and semi-structured data. Think of it as a file system, database, and NoSql system all rolled into one. It is currently in open beta at https://didgets.com/You say you have &#39;finished it&#39;. Software is never finished, but if you have checked off all the feature items from your design, then close enough for now. With my project, the TODO list is still extremely long. It can do many things already, but I seem to put two more items on the list every time I cross one off.It seems that every solo, multi-year project goes through the phases you describe (burn out, depression, questioning your sanity, etc.) and mine is no exception. It still feels very self-fulfilling every time I get a major piece working or I blow away the alternative in a speed test."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"OP, I&#39;ve been working on a very similar thing for some years now, too.  I could write a book about this at this point, but I will avoid gushing here.Please let me share some pain.Many developers/companies make this thing and none of them really know how to (or can) share.  I&#39;m happy to share my list.The end result, as I see it, is a fragmented mess of either partially completed or fully completed and walled (and/or poorly modularized) software.Take for example VS Code&#39;s tree view.  Can a developer with a need for an explorer view just use VS Code&#39;s tree module?  Not hardly.  Go reinvent.Contrast that with CodeMirror.  If you look, you will see CodeMirror everywhere.  This software truly  empowers devs and it has resulted in pure awesomeness.There&#39;s no shame in not open sourcing what you&#39;ve created, I&#39;m assuming you haven&#39;t.  And I can&#39;t say anything about how you have modularized your components.But it pains me that the next dev who gets an idea like yours will either give up or spend 6 years struggling to create the same thing (except the CodeMirror part).Worse, Microsoft can afford to struggle and or throw people/money at this.  They can pay people to work full time.  They can give away their editor(and more) for free.  That&#39;s a win from user&#39;s POV.Are you aware that VS Code runs on GitHub and does the majority of this kind of thing?  I think they could completely shut down all sandboxes or similar kinds of software from a financial perspective.I said I wouldn&#39;t write a book.Anyways, I strongly appreciate what you have done.  It looks great.I wish we lived in a world where we could work on the same team building this kind of thing.My best wishes to you on getting paid to do it full time."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I&#39;ve been thinking it&#39;s time to start moving away from that damn site.- If I actually want to start conversations, I get a lot more comments on HN or Reddit- When I was a job searcher, the idea of just being able to apply from my profile was really cool. Except every job just re-directed you to some form that wanted you to upload a resume anyway.- Of the handful of potential clients who have found me there, none have ended up signing a contract. Better odds just talking on random slack channels.- It&#39;s getting more and more cringe. Call me a prude but it&#39;s really tacky when people post photos of stuff like their wife and their baby asleep on the couch. Do you really want to post your families intimate moments to get likes on a &#34;professional&#34; social network?- If I&#39;m honest with myself I realise that I just replaced my addiction to one blue site (FB) with another.Anyway add me on LinkedIn!! https://www.linkedin.com/in/lewisandrewcampbell/"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"A bit of tangent, but it reminds me of a funny story:I discovered one day that I am getting recommended &#34;Long distance truck driver&#34; jobs through email and some of the re-targeted ads. First, I ignored them, but in a week or two, it became apparent that it was not just a coincidence.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I don&#39;t have a car and absolutely hate the car-centric culture of American cities (I live in SF).That being said, this article is completely wrong and draws the wrong conclusions. People were anti-car early on because most people didn&#39;t have cars. Later, people stopped being anti-car because most people had cars. The article would have you believe that at no point in time did the majority of people want car-centric city streets and that it was forced on them by a small minority of people interested in selling cars. That simply isn&#39;t the case. Vocal opposition to cars faded away as more people owned them.It&#39;s important to understand the status quo correctly if we ever want to change things. The sad reality is that most people want cars, even in dense cities. As I look out my apartment window on a Sunday morning, with pleasant weather and a walkable green neighborhood, I still count far more cars going by than people on foot or bicycle. Hopefully that would change if we made it easier and safer for people to walk, but it&#39;s not productive to pretend most people secretly hate cars."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Ouch, so US towns and cities didn&#39;t always be hostile towards walking.  My assumption that it&#39;s always been this way, was wrong.But in a way that&#39;s worse because it means they used to have this privilege and it has been taken away, and cars-first has become the norm.But the roads would have been used for something, at a guess, was it trams and horse carriages, and that these didn&#39;t pose much of a problem?  I&#39;ve been to towns with trams in the middle of roads and it&#39;s normal for people to just walk around it or near the tracks without problem.  But I am a stupid tourist so I kept my distance."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I remember in Sixth Grade (in Maryland), our teacher telling us that there was still a law on the state books, that said (I can’t remember what he said, precisely, but this is the gist):If a car is going in one direction on a road, and there is a horse (I don’t think he specified whether or not it was harnessed, but I’ll bet it needed to be in harness) coming the opposite direction, the car needed to pull over, and yield to the horse.If the horse refused to pass the car, then it was incumbent upon the car owner to (in escalating order):1) Turn off the engine.2) Cover the car in a blanket.3) Dismantle the car, piece by piece, until the horse passes.I could see a cranky old farmer having fun with that law."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This article perfectly exemplifies the arguments in discussions. Lets just concentrate on the waste discussion. The article says heavy metals in solar panels are a problem (I kind of agree, although the way it is described makes it out like we are talking about huge amounts, in reality the lead in solar panels is largely from soldering so very small amounts. Orders of magnitude more are being used for other applications (like car batteries)). They then say that recycling is currently still a problem (sort of true, although there are companies who say they can 100% recycling solar panels already). Similarly for wind they say we still don&#39;t know how to recycle the carbon blades, again sort of correct (but there are many other applications of carbon fibre which produce much more waste).Then when it comes to nuclear waste however, the argument is we can ignore pretty much all long lasting waste, because of some development in the future will make recycling of spend fuel rods feasible. So essentially he is comparing the current state of solar panel recycling to some future potential nuclear waste recycling. That&#39;s a dishonest comparison. Moreover ignoring the amount of waste from dismantling the nuclear power plant (which needs to go into nuclear storage because it is radioactive due to irradiation), while talking about the carbon fibre from wind turbines is also disingenuous.We see the same argumentive structure when talking about the economics; the current state of renewables is compared to some potential future state of nuclear. While in reality renewables are on an exponential cost reduction trajectory and all the nuclear potential is completely unproven."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"There is this idea that nuclear is not being deployed because people have a wrong perception of risks.However, the main reason is the economy. The costs of solar, wind and batteries are dropping exponentially but the costs of nuclear are not improving. We can blame regulation and the hypothetically wrong public perception about safety, but the reality is that costs cannot go down easily because of the innovation dynamics:1. It takes several years to build a nuclear reactor. Hence, innovations take a decade to reach the market. Learning curve has to be slow.2. A nuclear reactor cannot be shipped, it has to be build on site. This makes manufacturing automation, economies of scale and competition hard. In other words: you cannot have factories in China, or elsewhere, shipping cheap nuclear reactors all over the planet.A change in regulation might lower the costs, but it&#39;s not going to improve much the innovation dynamics.In conclusion, all this talking is mostly irrelevant: nuclear reactors are simply not going to be built because they are not competitive. And things are getting worse by the day because the alternatives have a better innovation cycle."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"We saw another downside of nuclear power in Ukraine: When Russian troops attacked towards Enerhodar and there was shelling in the area the safety of the  reactor could not be guaranteed. In the end, containment can be guaranteed w.r.t to internal accidents but no facility can ever be safe from outside issues like war, natural disaster or politics.Solar has less single points of failure and if it fails not much happens, like in the case of the stolen solar power plant (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tokmak_Solar_Energy)."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Russian here. Roskomnadzor&#39;s capabilities for blocking TOR are quite sufficient to cripple TOR&#39;s capabilities to the point of making it unusable as a VPN service, unless you set up your own private TOR ramp, which in this case is essentially the same as personal VPN, but much more slow.The algorithm is quite simple:1. Attempt to connect to TOR2. If it connects, blacklist the IP, goto 1.3. TOR is unavailable(If an anonymous TOR user can obtain bridge address, shared by any means, email, Signal, messenger pigeons or whatever, RKN operative can obtain it as well)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This has been really fascinating to watch. A patch just landed in Pion DTLS[0] yesterday to make the fingerprinting harder. I don&#39;t remember all the commits, but the Tor devs are absolutely amazing to work with and submit patches that are pretty much perfect :)If you haven&#39;t had a chance to investigate WebRTC I really think it is worth it. WebRTC gives up P2P Data/Media everywhere and it is really hard to block (because so many companies depend on it). To me it really feels like the best path forward to circumventing control. It also is a great career move. You can help people build conferencing tools during the day, and Censorship Circumvention at night.[0] https://github.com/pion/dtls/commit/de299f573c3e44fece16f09c..."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I remember during my undergraduate physics years at the University of Otago, we had a visiting guest speaker - I think it was Dale Bridenbaugh around 1976 when he had resigned as a manager in GE&#39;s nuclear division worried that their plants were not safe [0].  He had just also toured Australia as a guest speaker toward the anti-uranium effort [1].At the time, Robert Muldoon was Prime Minister of New Zealand and was pursuing &#34;think big&#34; projects for NZ including a planned nuclear power station.  As one of the &#34;GE Three&#34; [2], Bridenbaugh blew the whistle that the quoted price tag of the
power plant did not include necessary safety precautions which he eloquently explained would cost at least an order of magnitude more (greater than the GDP of NZ).  Of course the whole idea made no sense in a country blessed with hydro and geothermal resources.  In the end the project was abandoned for total cost of ownership budget reasons rather than nuclear issues.I wonder what has changed since then?[0] https://www.times.org/nuclear-power-back/2018/3/8/the-long-t...[1] https://www.bmartin.cc/pubs/82alternatives.html[2] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GE_Three"</p>

I was a &#34;nuke&#34; so had to go in the reactor compartment several times. As far as I can remember, the reactor was about 10 feet in diameter. We went in the shipyard for refueling after the lifetime of the rods, which was 15 years. I could never understand why we didn&#39;t build these for civilian use (cost I figured) but now we will. Cool.https://www.nrc.gov/reading-rm/doc-collections/news/2022/22-..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"While this is an overall good development, and I wish the company luck. Its really not the solution.While scale is what killed nuclear, the people who initially decided on scale, did so for good reason. You lose a huge amount if you scale down, specially with PWRs.These small PWRs try to get some of that efficiency back with factory production, but at best it just evens out. The advantage is the added flexibility. So I don&#39;t think that putting traditional PWR in a tube is really any kind of series solution to transform our energy system.However there are good things coming out of this. For example, NuScale went threw a process managing multiple reactors from the same control room. That is the same thing that essentially all GenIV reactors want to do as well. Having managed to get that concept threw the regulator will make it massively easier for anybody that follows.Its a damn shame that we don&#39;t have GenIV reactors since the 80s. We had the technology and every reason to use it. We could be living in a nuclear age right now, and I consider it the largest failure of humanity that we failed to do so. People in 100 years will look back and think we were insane that we did not use the technology we discovered."</p>

As Wikipedia notes (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steven_Donziger), significant evidence of Donziger&#39;s fraud ended up being captured by a friendly documentary crew that had been following him around.The Permanent Court of Arbitration in The Hague found that the evidence placed before the Court was &#34;the most thorough documentary, video, and testimonial proof of fraud ever put before an arbitral tribunal&#34;, and that [Donziger] did engage in blackmail and bribery of Ecuadorian judges.The situation is complex, and I certainly don&#39;t have any insight into the true rights and wrongs of the case. And there&#39;s certainly evidence that points towards Donziger&#39;s innocence too. But Esquire&#39;s take is, I think, entirely unbalanced, and discounts out of hand the idea that any of the many, many court cases Donziger has lost (in multiple legal systems and in front of multiple judges) may have been at all correct."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Update from AWS: they lost power to (part of?) a single DC in the use2-az1 availability zone.10:25 AM PDT We can confirm that some instances within a single Availability Zone (USE2-AZ1) in the US-EAST-2 Region have experienced a loss of power. The loss of power is affecting part of a single data center within the affected Availability Zone. Power has been restored to the affected facility and at this stage the majority of the affected EC2 instances have recovered. We expect to recover the vast majority of EC2 instances within the next hour. For customers that need immediate recovery, we recommend failing away from the affected Availability Zone as other Availability Zones are not affected by this issue."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&gt; The dog has a lot of false positives from the cameras being triggered by car headlights or small animals.My real dog has the same feature, so you’re at least doing a good job mimicking nature, heh."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"When I bought a house I picked up a dog dish and put it by my walkout basement sliding door.  Also the pond next to my house has old tennis balls show up in it now and then so I put them next to the dish.According to the local cops break ins in my area are mostly just kids going into open garage / garage side doors / back doors that are left open and stuff to steal is out and obvious and so on.I figure just the sense of hassle / unknown of &#34;who knows how this dog is&#34; might be enough of a deterrent."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"To add credence to this post, I once heard an interview with an incarcerated burglar who claimed that dogs where the one deterrent that scared him off. He said that an alarm as only as good as the response times of the police and he&#39;s usually in and out of there in five minutes anyway. But who wants to risk it with a dog? Better to just move on to the next house.A few more tips:- Best place to hide valuables is in the kitchen pantry. Master bedroom is the most common place, but who is gonna think to go through your snack food.- A lot of burglaries happen in the winter in the late afternoon or early evening when it is starting to get dark out, but before the homeowners get home from work.- Your house is only as strong as the weakest link. Fancy locks can be bypassed by breaking a window. Design your security system to handle low level burglars (who probably don&#39;t know how to pick a lock), not foreign spies. For most people, this also holds true for online security."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Camera software is an area that is frustratingly closed off, and where manufacturers regularly differentiate new/more expensive cameras with firmware differences: subject detection, auto focus, drive modes (pre-capture, higher frame rates, etc), file format support (HEIC, compressed raw, colorspaces), ui features (how custom modes work, menu systems, etc).Competition in this space driven by a provider that doesn&#39;t have a motive to convince users to buy the next new camera (ie: open source software) would be very useful to users.Sony and Panasonic cameras (and perhaps other manufacturers) are running Linux (and release some of the third party source code they include in their products, but the amount of reverse engineering that has been done on those camera&#39;s software.Canon uses a custom RTOS (DryOS), and lots of work has been done to extend the existing Canon firmware to enhance its capabilities (Magic Lantern[1] and CHDK[2]), but as far as I know fully open software for these devices doesn&#39;t exist.Camera capabilities these days are highly software dependent, and the functionality of dedicated cameras is held back by subpar software development practices and a lack of pressure to make things better.1: https://magiclantern.fm/

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The problem isn&#39;t the capability of remote attestation.  The problem is who&#39;s using it, i.e. who&#39;s defining what &#34;security&#34; means.  As noted above, for a company, &#34;security&#34; often means intentionally inhibiting my freedom, not actually securing anything I care about.We would benefit from a better public discussion of what &#34;security&#34; encompasses.  Else, we risk conflating &#34;what MS wants me to do with my computer&#34; with &#34;preventing hackers from stealing my credit card number&#34;.Imagine a world where you could submit personal information to a company, with the technological assurance that this information would not leave that company... and you could verify this with remote attestation of the software running on that company&#39;s servers."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Is there any way we can make Remote Attestation providers liable for any losses incurred while using their services? Can we make it so that banks, record companies, and individuals can sue Microsoft or Google if their system doesn&#39;t deliver on the promise? If we still see cheating in on-line gaming even though all machines are attested, can we we get our money back?I feel like part of the problem is that Remote Attestation providers get to have their cake and eat it too: they make a theme park, set up boundaries, and charge admission under the premise that it&#39;s safer to play in their walled garden than in a public park.But if a bad actor slips through their gate and picks a few pockets or kidnaps a couple children, the operators get to say &#34;not our problem, our services have no warranty -- read the EULA&#34;.I feel like in the real world, if a park operator explicitly bills itself as &#34;a safe place to play&#34; it&#39;s their problem if someone goes on a crime spree on their property -- there is some duty to deliver on the advertised safety promise.But somehow, in the software world people can control admission, control what you do and somehow have no liability if things still go off the rails. It&#39;s just a sucker&#39;s game.Of course, I&#39;d rather not see remote attestation happen, but maybe part of the reason it keeps creeping back is exactly because there is zero legal downside to making security promises that can&#39;t be kept, but incredible market advantages if they can sucker enough people to believe in the scheme."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Unpopular opinion:Hardware-based attestation of the running software is an important security feature, especially in a world where data leaks and identity theft are rampant. Let&#39;s say I&#39;m a healthcare provider, and I&#39;m about to send sensitive medical data to a third party vendor. Wouldn&#39;t you prefer that this data only be able to be decrypted by a computer that can prove to the world it booted a clean OS image with all the latest security patches installed?If the vendor wants to install some self-built OS that they trust on their computer and not update it for 5 years, that&#39;s their business, but I may not want to trust their computer to have access to my personal data.Remote attestation gives more control to the owners of data to dictate how that data is processed on third-party machines (or even their own machines that may have been compromised). This is useful for more than just DRM."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I made this site.Copying a comment I made on HN a few weeks ago:The ADS-B signals that many aircraft broadcast include not just the aircraft&#39;s GPS positions, but also a measure of GPS accuracy (strictly speaking, ADS-B doesn&#39;t talk about GPS specifically and can handle any sort of navigation technology; I&#39;m sure there are some planes out there reporting positions based on inertial navigation systems, with correspondingly low accuracy, or GLONASS-derived positions, or whatever, but my understanding is that right now something on the order of 99% of aircraft with ADS-B are using good old GPS so I&#39;ll just keep using the term GPS in this description). If you go to https://globe.adsbexchange.com and click on just about any aircraft, you&#39;ll see an info sidebar on the left of the screen. Scroll down until you see the ACCURACY section, and you&#39;ll see values labeled NACp, SIL, NACv, NICbaro, and Rc. Those are all self-reported measures of the accuracy of the data being sent by the aircraft[1]. NACp is &#34;Navigation Accuracy Category for position&#34;, and is a good measure of whether the aircraft&#39;s GPS is working well. (A somewhat obscure feature of ADS-B Exchange lets you see a map of all aircraft that are currently reporting poor navigation accuracy for their GPS: https://globe.adsbexchange.com/?badgps)To make the maps, I process a day&#39;s worth of data from ADS-B Exchange to find all the aircraft reporting poor navigation accuracy and then I color map hexes (using H3 hexes) according to the proportion of aircraft passing through that hex that reported bad GPS accuracy. Specifically, I&#39;m counting an aircraft as experiencing &#34;interference&#34; if it at some point reported good navigation accuracy and then reported low accuracy. Doing this helps filter out aircraft that just have an ongoing issue with their GPS equipment, or don&#39;t even have GPS.When I do that, areas where there is systematic interference—almost always jamming by military systems—become obvious. There are a few conflict zones (Syria, Cyprus, Israel) that have been experiencing jamming for years, and the U.S. often has smaller scale military testing, especially in the West and Southwest. You can also see the jammers that are apparently setup around Moscow to prevent drones from flying near Oligarch dachas[2].I started making these maps in February before Russia invaded Ukraine because I thought it might provide an early warning of an invasion. I didn&#39;t see that, and in fact this technique doesn&#39;t do a very good job of mapping GPS jamming around the actual war zones because civil aviation stopped over Ukraine, so there are zero or few aircraft with ADS-B reporting their GPS accuracy[3]. Without that data, I can&#39;t make a map.Sometimes I do see changes, like when Russia suddenly started jamming around Kaliningrad in March 2022, causing interference in many Baltic states and leading to Finland to cancel some flights[4]. Then a few days later, they just stopped.I don&#39;t think too many people have realized yet what an amazing source of GPS interference data is available using ADS-B! It&#39;s like having thousands of sensors roaming the planet, broadcasting GPS accuracy data every few seconds. I sometimes wonder if I would disrupt someone&#39;s nascent business model if I started publishing my maps regularly.1. https://twitter.com/lemonodor/status/1493789598077440000

								<p class="story__comment_others">"A quick update on some of the infrastructure behind the map: One day of being on the front page of HN has used up half of the Mapbox free quota of map loads. To sustain this level of traffic would cost me something like $2000/month just for Mapbox. Since this is a non-profit project that I do in my spare time, something is going to have to give."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is fascinating. Really cool to see a map of GPS signals on Earth and the site looks really good, too. Love the colors and interface! Awesome :)Can anyone narrate any of the jammed signals? Like for instance what would be jamming in the ocean between Tripoli and Benghazi? Or what would be jamming around San Antonio, TX?"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I made an interactive art installation on this question once: A black box with a knob where you could adjust how much time you have, then it would offer you (Google streetview) panoramas of the locations it found within your distance, and in the end even print a paper slip with your travel itinerary to take with you.The installation used realtime data (Google directions API): I somehow figured out, that if I would run this from a local machine and reset the browser frequently, Google would let me do this even without an API key… they certainly sensed something was awry and I did get API warnings and captchas because of &#39;suspicious traffic on my network&#39;, but they were nice enough not to block me completely. I strongly doubt this would still work though, this was in 2017.Pictures and videos of the installation: https://maschinenzeitmaschine.de/derweil/"</p>

It turns out that the world has moved on. Web pages are getting harder to read on small screens. I had to squint a lot. The phone&#39;s short height means that it often doesn&#39;t charge &#34;vertically&#34; in Qi chargers. It doesn&#39;t fit in my car&#39;s integrated phone holder, it just rattles around.And I really missed the zoom lens.So I&#39;m OK with the Pro, and I will get used to slightly larger phones.(The &#34;Max&#34; is still stupid.)"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I love Tabler and have used it for a few projects with great success.The title of the OP is not really accurate though. It&#39;s not so much a framework but a bunch of customization on top of Bootstrap and some pre-built templates for stuff _like_ dashboards, galleries, forms, etc. The site is more like a kitchen sink demo and documentation site for stuff you can pick apart and use in your own application."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I love Tabler. I&#39;ve used it for a few Rails projects and since Rails 7 it&#39;s even easier to integrate thanks to Import Maps. I can get a project off the ground even faster with this UI kit. I&#39;m already used to the Bootstrap classes and tags so this is just the final component for maximum productivity.I get some people don&#39;t dig the design but I think it look serious, and in general that&#39;s what dashboard are for, serious business. They need to be readable and simple to understand and use. Tabler gives that vibe.Edit: As an afterthought, I would really appreciate if anyone knows any similar projects. It&#39;d nice to compare and have more options. So far I havent found anything so compelling in this space."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"it looks like tabler uses jekyll underneath for docs and demo (which i personally like and am comfortable with). the demo is really nice, ahd while i&#39;m not big on js any more, the js driving tabler looks fairly straightforward and appropriate to my eyes.the underlying html and css, however, give me pause about how easy it would be to integrate into a larger project. &lt;div&gt; soup is how i&#39;d describe the demo html, and its css uses custom properties (css variables) in a way that, on first glance, seems to make it more verbose without adding power, flexibility, or maintainability (or accessibility, but that seems a really big challenge for data-heavy frontends like this).i&#39;d probably try this out if i needed a dashboard on a project, but perhaps would want to test drive it on a small/test project to see where the gotchas are first."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"You would really hope there would be some far reaching repercussions for senior leadership at Google on this one. There are lots of projects that Google has tried and failed on, and sure, that happens. But this one is probably the clearest, obvious failure of execution. There is an absolutely crystal clear playbook of a Tech company forcing its way into the Gaming business. So how Google has managed to enter, completely fuck up, screw around partners, screw around customers and then leave all within the span of 3 years is just fantastic.And it&#39;s not just that, because Google&#39;s reputation for giving up on anything remotely difficult, no one bought into it in the first place. I would wager there are entire market segments that Google can just never enter now since they have done such a good job at branding themselves unreliable. It reminds me of a Petrostate where a country has huge wealth because of what they&#39;re sitting on, but that same wealth destroys their ability to develop anything meaningfully different."</p>

Stadia removes all fraction and means I don&#39;t need to install/update or have gaming hardware.The service is great. Despite it not being popular. It would be an absolute disaster for me if the service were to close."</p>

						<a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=32275078">
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I really appreciate when people use technical facts to criticize something, like with this. It is a well written take-down of the implementation of the Windows Registry as of both today and 2010.I suspect if the concept of the registry was created today it would look more like a database (e.g. Sqlite), although organizing it like a virtual FileSystem does have a certain appeal, and unfortunately I don&#39;t know of a database engine that supports such a layout. The Registry&#39;s Key-Value pairs are 1:1 with a database table&#39;s column-values pairs, it is just the multiple tiers of organizing &#34;folders&#34; above that that are a difficult implementation detail.The UNIX way is undeniably more flexible since it isn&#39;t a virtual filesystem, it is just a filesystem. The problem is that everyone invented their own configuration format to store configuration data in /etc and there&#39;s no format agnostic API to access that information (you can open it, but can you understand it?).Both UNIX and Windows suffer from the same orphan issue wherein information can be written, the application removed, and it is unsafe to ever remove it since you may not know the author and or all consumers."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I don&#39;t feel like this article is good enough to be worth resharing 12 years later.It missed some of the key reasons why the Registry is bad and other criticisms (&#34;We have to write exactly the bytes Windows expects.&#34; yeah of course you do. It&#39;s only meant to be changed using APIs.) are not very well thought out.The criticism that the Registry is a janky filesystem in a single file is dismissed because you can do the same thing with ext3. That&#39;s not a good reason to dismiss it. Just because you can do a similar thing doesn&#39;t mean it is a good thing to do for the Registry. The Registry being a single file is a cause of a ton of problems, and is IMHO the root of all the other problems. If this were a better technical article it would go into that instead of hand waving it away. (E.g. it being a single file leads to the all or nothing nature of it. It necessitates the bad filesystem implementation instead of using the actual underlying filesystem, etc.)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"A point being overlooked by article and commenters: the records in the registry probably use in the order of 10-100 bytes each, while every actual file takes up at least around 1024 (EDIT: maybe more like 4096?) bytes. Putting tiny &#39;files&#39; into a special format is a no-brainer on the older computers that existed when the Registry was first created. I am assuming this was one of the motivations to create the Registry in the first place, to save space."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I just took a look at the quickstart guide. The way the code snippets are implemented is gorgeous. They are syntax highlighted, are formatted/indented exactly as they would be in the terminal, line breaks are indented correctly but css is used to make them easily copy/pastable without including any line numbers/indentation characters. Such a delight. Such focus on details. Makes me really confident in the rest of the project."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Congratulation on the 2.0 release. EdgeDB looks awesome. However, I will not advocate using it for any of my clients unless there&#39;s a clear path to derisking its adoption. Like all new software products/services there&#39;s a significant risk of it becoming abandonware. I&#39;d obviously want EdgeDB to succeed but how can one de-risk adopting it?
Would it be possible to somehow &#34;transpile&#34;  both queries and modeling scripts to readable SQL? That way, worste case scenario one may fall back on Postgresql without loosing most of previous work.
Let me be clear. I really like EdgeDB  and obviously want the best for and you guys but I do not think I&#39;m alone in thinking that we need a clear, easy and verifiable way to fallback to Posgresql if/when needed."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I want to build local first software backed by EdgeDB. Similar to these tools:- https://replicache.dev- https://github.com/tantaman/conflict-free-sqlite- https://aphrodite.shI wonder if EdgeDB provides any utilities to make this already perhaps? Or community has to build some kind of CRDT software that builds on top of EdgeDB that will do local syncing? Maybe that&#39;s planned to be tackled for 3.0?"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Before my comment gets dismissed, I will disclaim I am a professional structural biologist that works in this field every day.These threads are always the same: lots of comments about protein folding, how amazing DeepMind is, how AlphaFold is a success story, how it has flipped an entire field on it&#39;s head, etc. The language from Google is so deceptive about what they&#39;ve actually done, I think it&#39;s actually intentionally disingenuous.At the end of the day, AlphaFold is amazing homology modeling. I love it, I think it&#39;s an awesome application of machine learning, and I use it frequently. But it&#39;s doing the same thing we&#39;ve been doing for 2 decades: pattern matching sequences of proteins with unknown structure to sequences of proteins with known structure, and about 2x as well as we used to be able to.That&#39;s extremely useful, but it&#39;s not knowledge of protein folding. It can&#39;t predict a fold de novo, it can&#39;t predict folds that haven&#39;t been seen (EDIT: this is maybe not strictly true, depending on how you slice it), it fails in a number of edge cases (remember, in biology, edge cases are everything) and again, I can&#39;t stress this enough, we have no new information on how proteins fold. We know all the information (most of at least) for a proteins final fold is in the sequence. But we don&#39;t know much about the in-between.I like AlphaFold, it&#39;s convenient and I use it (although for anything serious or anything interacting with anything else, I still need a real structure), but I feel as though it has been intentionally and deceptively oversold. There are 3-4 other deep learning projects I think have had a much greater impact on my field.EDIT: 
See below: 
https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=32265662 for information on predicting new folds."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I got a 5th grader question about how proteins are used/represented graphically that I&#39;ve never been able to find a satisfying answer for.Basically, you see these 3D representations of specific proteins as a crumple of ribbons-- literally like someone ran multi-colored ribbons though scissors to make curls and dumped it on the floor (like a grade school craft project).So... I understand that proteins are huge organic molecules composed of thousands of atoms, right? Their special capabilities arise from their structure/shape. So basically the molecule contorts itself to a low energy state which could be very complex but which enables it to &#34;bind?&#34; to other molecules expressly because of this special shape and do the special things that proteins do-- that form the basis of living things. Hence the efforts, like Alphafold, to compute what these shapes are for any given protein molecule.But what does one &#34;do&#34; with such 3D shapes?They seem intractably complex. Are people just browsing these shapes and seeing patterns in them? What do the &#34;ribbons&#34; signify? Are they just some specific arrangement of C,H,O? Why are some ribbons different colors? Why are there also thread-like things instead of all ribbons?Also, is that what proteins would really look like if you could see at sub-optical wavelength resolutions? Are they really like that? I recall from school the equipartition theorem-- 1/2 KT of kinetic energy for each degree of freedom. These things obviously have many degrees of freedom. So wouldn&#39;t they be &#34;thrashing around&#34; like rag doll in a blender at room temperature? It seems strange to me that something like that could be so central to life, but it is.Just trying to get myself a cartoonish mental model of how these shapes are used! Anyone?"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Lawrence Lessig (Harvard law professor famous for fighting for sane copyright law) does a great presentation on the root cause of Americas problems. He also ran for president in 2016.It can be watched here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJy8vTu66tEThe short version is that to win primaries you need money. Money mainly comes from corporations and rich people. Taking money from corporations and rich people creates a relationship where you have some loyalty to them or they can punish you if you don&#39;t act how they want. Thus the primary corrupting force in America is pro-corruption campaign finance laws.The test for democracy is whether elected politicians pass legislation that the public at large wishes to be passed. Our very own Princeton did a study to answer this question.The key finding: “The preferences of the average American appear to have only a miniscule, near-zero, statistically non-significant impact upon public policy.”[1]In a very real, non hyperbolic sense we are in a plutocracy where money rules. We are not a democracy due chiefly to our campaign finance laws.Here is a campaign that aims to work on this:

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Hear me out...  few people want to run for federal office already.  The pay isn&#39;t great and it&#39;s hard work.If the US was a company, there&#39;d be no question that we&#39;d need to pay our leadership much better to attract top talent.  We pay senators $170k a year to manage our country with a $20 trillion economy.So what we end up with is activists who crave power and elites from rich families for whom $170k a year is a rounding error.  Those families then use the power from being in office to enrich their families even more.One solution could be to double or triple pay for US representatives along with banning stock trading and things like &#34;speaking fees.&#34;"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;ve been collecting and sharing (@QuiverCongress on Twitter) data on stock trading by U.S. congressmen for the past couple years.While there is currently legislation that requires congressmen to disclose their financial dealings, enforcement around it is incredibly weak.Congressmen are supposed to disclose stock transactions within 45 days of when they are made, but in practice there are dozens of violations of this rule which result in hardly a slap on the wrist. I&#39;ve seen a couple cases of politicians conveniently waiting till after election cycles to disclose controversial trades.While I&#39;m generally pessimistic about the odds of congress voting to regulate itself, I&#39;m still hopeful that something comes from this push. There&#39;s certainly a lot of room for improvement."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Please, please, please,  avoid status cuisines. It&#39;s going to be hard to do, because they make good PR. But you will be helping your users a lot more of you hold them off with a ten foot pole. What do I mean by a status cuisine? They are meals that are intended to show that the cook is a worthy person, rather than that the meal is practical, healthy, and good to eat. Here are some examples:The endurance cuisine: designed to show that the cook has time to spare, the endurance cuisine requires that no ingredient is pre-processed in any way. Grind your own grain, bake your own breadcrumbs, chop your own veg. Using grapes? You should have peeled them!The hair-shirt cuisine: you have to endure some discomfort if it&#39;s good for you, right? This cuisine specialises in sour tastes and unpleasant mouthfeel -  often using grains that our stone-age ancestors sensibly gave up for nicer ones.The gold plated cuisine: this one&#39;s obvious. Pricier ingredients must be better - or at least show how much the cook can spendThe obscurantist/connoisseur&#39;s cuisine: it can&#39;t be good if it&#39;s easy to find. The cook can only be good if they know exactly how many &#39;extras&#39; you need in your virgin olive oil, and what classification of wine you should put in your coq&#39;au&#39;vin.(Okay this is a bit tongue in cheek - but only a bit. I really do think a lot of recipes are unnecessarily onerous in some way)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;ve done a few quizzes on the app now, and I don&#39;t get it. The questions feel very contrived, like someone had a quota to fill so just put whatever looked plausible together. They are also _very_ culturally specific.Questions about eggs barely made sense to me being from the UK, with incorrect pack sizes, animal welfare terms, and completely missed our great standards body that makes it easy to know which eggs have met a reasonable quality bar. It&#39;s not that the info is globally applicable, it&#39;s that it&#39;s an awkward combination of wrong and useless depending on where you live. Starting another quiz about kitchen equipment it seems this is a pattern throughout.Cooking is deeply embedded into culture, tradition, region, climate, regulatory environment, retail infrastructure, and more. I don&#39;t think these quizzes will be able to overcome this without being fully localised per country.The recipes? Maybe they&#39;re better. I don&#39;t know, I&#39;m still 7 levels away from being able to know how to make scrambled eggs.Edit: when I opened the app the first time it asked me how experienced I am and I answered the 3rd out of 4 options, I know my way around a kitchen. The app just asked me to match pictures of eggs to how they have been cooked: fried, scrambled, etc. I&#39;m not sure I can survive this level of patronisation, it&#39;s honestly a bit insulting.Edit: &#34;what sort of pan should you cook eggs in&#34;... &#34;no not a wok, people don&#39;t have those at home&#34;. Ouch. At best that&#39;s incredibly sheltered for a food writer, and at worst it&#39;s practically racist."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I wish you good luck but I don&#39;t get it either.The thing that makes Duolingo great is that right away you learn words in a new language.  It hooks you.  Within 1 lesson you know several words or a phrase with a few variations.This is more just random trivia about food that no one cares about.  I started with the cheeseburger recipe (apparently an advanced lesson or something).  Right away it&#39;s asking me a bunch of questions about ground meat but teaching me nothing.  Where&#39;s the hook?  I want to see a recipe and learn to make it, not feel like I&#39;m taking a test about a bunch of stuff I was never taught with no obvious path to simply making the thing I want to make.  In the 5 minutes I spent on it I feel like I was just getting grilled (metaphorically).  The first 5 minutes of Duolingo I actually learned something.Anyhow, suggestion would be to start right away with the thing people actually want...  How to cook the food and make the recipe."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I think that MS here is being used as a convenient scapegoat. This worry was never expressed at the time in significant terms. The FAT and SMB patents were much more of a worry than anything related to the desktop interface - only outright clones were being pursued.At the time, KDE, GNOME and Ubuntu developers alike, were simply drunk on popularity. Linux usage was in ascendancy, money was being thrown around, and the FOSS world was starting to attract young designers who saw it as a cheap way to build professional credibility. And then the iPhone happened and the whole UX world just went apeshit. The core teams really thought they had a shot at redesigning how people interact with computers, &#34;like Apple did with phones&#34;. Interaction targets moved from keyboard+mouse to touch screens, because &#34;convergence&#34; and the fact that the mobile sector was suddenly awash with cash.It&#39;s sad that people try to justify their missteps in this way. Microsoft was (and is) a terrible company and a constant threat to the FOSS ecosystem, but defining some of the biggest design choices of the Linux desktop only in antagonistic or reflective terms does a real disservice to those projects and the people who worked in them.If experience is the name we give our errors, refusing to accept errors were made means stating you&#39;ve learnt nothing."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I was the lead designer of Unity. Unity was not a response to patent concerns, but rather the manifestation of a convoluted OEM strategy involving exclusive distribution of distinct design features, and a write-once-run-anywhere dream of running Ubuntu on any device from netbooks to big screens to automobiles."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is news to me.  I remember that the Linux desktop seemed to be on the ascendancy back in 2006.  GNOME 2 and KDE 3 were very nice desktops; while they weren’t Mac OS X Tiger (which still holds up as an amazing desktop), they were solid contenders to Windows XP.  But then came GNOME 3 and KDE 4, which were major fumbles that set back the Linux desktop for years.If it’s true that GNOME’s radical direction beginning with version 3 is the result of threats from Microsoft to change its desktop to avoid influences from Windows, then that definitely changes my assessment of the era, and my distaste for Microsoft’s anti-competitive behavior only deepens (this is the same Microsoft that complained about Apple’s look-and-feel lawsuits)."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This is really nicely written; kudos to the author for compiling a great deal of information in a readable format.If I can be forgiven one nitpick: Poetry does not use a PEP 518-style[1] build configuration by default, which means that its use of `pyproject.toml` is slightly out of pace with the rest of the Python packaging ecosystem. That isn&#39;t to say that it isn&#39;t excellent, because it is! But you the standards have come a long way, and you can now use `pyproject.toml` with any build backend as long as you use the standard metadata.By way of example, here&#39;s a project that&#39;s completely PEP 517 and PEP 518 compatible without needing a setup.py or setup.cfg[2]. Everything goes through pyproject.toml.[1]: https://peps.python.org/pep-0518/[2]: https://github.com/trailofbits/pip-audit/blob/main/pyproject..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"What a great article.We start with learning that we absolutely need this Poetry thing because… it&#39;s what everyone else uses. It&#39;s refreshing to see author who can skip usual badly argued justifications and just plain admin that he does not know shit and is just following rest of the herd.
Then we continue by &#34;solving&#34;  depependencies by usual way of ignoring them and just freezing whatever happens to be present.Then there is inevitable firing up of virtualenv, because that&#39;s just what you have to do when dealing  with messed up dependencies.Next one is new to me. Apparently, one does not just set up git hooks nowadays but use separate tool with declarative config. Because if you ever happen upon something not covered by the Tool, that would mean you are no longer part of the herd.Then we push our stuff straight to pypi, because of course our stuff can&#39;t possibly have any dependencies outside of python herd ecosystem. It&#39;s not like we knew our dependencies anyway.Then comes the fun part, pulling in tox, because when you have special tool to handle dependencies, what you just need is another tool with different environment and dependency model.Code quality section I will just skip over, seeing what pass for code quality these days makes me too sad.
What follows is setup of several proprietary projects that modern opensource seemingly can&#39;t exist without.
What is more interresting is &#34;tyding up&#34; by moving code from git root to subdir. Now, this is of course perfectly sensible thing to, but I wonder why is it called &#39;src&#39;? Maybe some herd memeber saw compiled language somewhere and picked it up without understanding difference between compiled binary and source code?Now don&#39;t take this as if I have problem with the article content in itself. No, as a primer to modern python packaging it&#39;s great. It&#39;s not authors fault that his work is so comprehensive it lays out bare all the idiosyncrasies, herd mentality, cargocultism and general laziness of python ecosystem these days. Or is it?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I wish people would just forget about pre-commit, this thing is especially useless in a setting where a CI/CD pipeline exists. It&#39;s not that hard to write a simple Makefile or shellscript to run linters on push.Pre-commit is one of the most annoying tools that have come into existence in recent years that everyone seems to be cargo-culting. It doesn&#39;t play well with editors since in order to find the actual binary path, you&#39;d have to open up a sqlite database to fish out the virtualenv pre-commit created. Pre-commit also increases maintenance burden, since its configuration is completely separate from your usual requirements-dev.txt/pyproject.toml/setup.cfg etc. If you have dev dependencies in one of these files because making your editors to find the pre-commit created binaries are hard, now you have to keep both versions in sync.I really don&#39;t see the point of any pre-commit hooks unless you are the one guy that doesn&#39;t use a modern CI/CD platform."</p>

Medium has something similar they called Snowflake - https://github.com/Medium/snowflake ... but note the disclaimer...&gt; Heads up: Medium isn’t using this tool anymore, but you’re welcome to!The problem with things like this is the typical engineering mindset, when shown a graphical or numerical analysis of their performance will zoom into analyse every detail and in the end it&#39;s just backed by the managers impressions and judgement.For similar reasons I have a strong opinion that engineers shouldn&#39;t be paid performance related bonuses, because no matter what happens, it&#39;s just going to upset them - the best case - maximum bonus - just equates to a &#34;meh&#34;. Better to pay a good base salary upfront ...Anyway use tools like this with caution IMO."</p>

Most things can be guided by merely understanding the principals of it.This very old doc (from Sun Microsystems engineers IIRC) remains excellent https://web.archive.org/web/20090420152505/http://mark.kampe...It speaks to the spirit, the principals, behind progression... and that makes it extremely applicable to lots of fields, personal paths, and environments."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Tolkien on Tom in Letter 144:I might put it this way. The story is cast in terms of a good side, and a bad side, beauty against ruthless ugliness, tyranny against kingship, moderated freedom with consent against compulsion that has long lost any object save mere power, and so on; but both sides in some degree, conservative or destructive, want a measure of control. but if you have, as it were taken &#39;a vow of poverty&#39;, renounced control, and take your delight in things for themselves without reference to yourself, watching, observing, and to some extent knowing, then the question of the rights and wrongs of power and control might become utterly meaningless to you, and the means of power quite valueless. It is a natural pacifist view, which always arises in the mind when there is a war.The Letters of J.R.R. Tolkien 144: To Naomi Mitchison. April 1954"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"To me, Tom Bombadil is the introduction of natural magic. He is nature, indicating to the reader that there is a source of magic beyond the elves, Wizards, and Sauron.There are many magical creatures in Middle-Earth without a described source, which to me makes the whole story feel more magic. The Ents probably being the chief example.Another important role of Tom’s is his introduction of magic and power outside of the “good vs evil” struggle."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; Possibly the least liked character in The Lord of the Rings. A childish figure so disliked by fans of the book that few object to his absence from all adaptations of the story.I&#39;ve been a fan of Tolkien for decades, and this doesn&#39;t match up with my experience at all...Tolkien fans seem to generally love Tom, and many were deeply disappointed that he wasn&#39;t in the movies (even though his exclusion makes perfect sense). Did I just run in different Tolkien circles than the author?"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I feel some of the OP points. I was working on a profiling agent lately, and one of the issues was running it on multiple platforms (just the four big ones linux/mac-x86/arm) on FFI (because it&#39;ll be run directly from python/ruby/etc...) and preferably having the thing just work without having to install or configure any dependencies.Like OP I hit two walls: libunwind, and linking. For libunwind, I ended up downloading/compiling manually; and for linking there is auditwheel[1]. Although it is a Python tool, I did actually end up using it for Ruby (by creating a &#34;fake python package&#34;, and then copying the linked dependencies).It was at that time that I learned about linking for dynamic libraries, patchelf and there is really no single/established tool to do this. I thought there should be something but most people seem to install the dependencies with any certain software. I also found, the hard way, that you still have to deal with gcc/c when working with Rust. It does isolate you from many stuff, but for many things there is no work around.There is a performance hit to this strategy, however, since shared dynamic libraries will be used by all the running programs that need them; whereas my solution will run its own instance. It made me wonder if wasm will come up with something similar without affecting portability.Finally, the project is open source and you can browse the code here: https://github.com/pyroscope-io/pyroscope-rs[1]: https://github.com/pypa/auditwheel"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Is compiling once and running on 6 platforms really that compelling? One of Rust’s super powers is that it’s really easy to write code once that can be compiled N times for N platforms without making any changes.I’m all about writing code once. But compiling a few times doesn’t seem like that big of a deal to me?The article says it runs on “six operating systems” but I can’t find them listed?"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Nobody hates Facebook users more than Facebook, I guess. :-/I&#39;ve tried to type out several pithy comments, but the bottom line (to me) is that Facebook just doesn&#39;t respect its users or care about their needs.Can you imagine if brick-and-mortar businesses tried to do this? You go out for a Big Mac, but it&#39;s not on the menu anymore because Taco Bell had a few really good quarters, so McDonald&#39;s decided to pivot to tacos. Maybe you can still order the Big Mac if you know to ask for it, but most people won&#39;t, and they&#39;ll leave disappointed instead of getting what they wanted.Edit: To clarify, this example is contrived and the details are not the point. The point is that Facebook offered something to their users, spent years and billions of dollars making sure that as many people as possible got it from Facebook, and then decided to just yank the rug out from under all those people to chase the fairy tale of endless growth."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"It’s crazy to think the social media era may finally be ending. There’s really no viable platform anymore where you can just go passively keep up with what friends and acquaintances are doing. Everything is about feeding you content you didn’t ask for but may be targeted enough to catch your attention.And for what? To show you some ads here and there? To collect data that can be used to… sell more ads and products?Instagram was once my favorite app. There was a golden age before stories came a long where people just posted random pictures of what they were up to or what they were seeing. Things weren’t too memefied or political, unlike Facebook. Then photos got more and more glamorized and more about flexing and showing how much cooler and more awesome your life was. People started following themes and niches for their profile content rather than just posting random unorganized series of photos. Businesses and brands started getting built on the platform.Building an Instagram clone the way it used to be is fairly trivial these days. I could probably throw one together in a few months, but growing its popularity is practically impossible these days with such entrenched incumbents and no niches left to start a user base with.…unless perhaps… we build a social network on the blockchain"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I know it sounds dumb but its hard to say we haven&#39;t moved closer to what only ~10 years ago we considered a &#34;playful exaggeration&#34; on the worst of humans and social media.In WallE, everyone is floating around in chairs having their content spoon-fed to them with a generous amount of ads mixed in.  If you&#39;ve ever scrolled or seen someone scroll, its kinda close.  Just mindlessly moving their thumb up and down, taking in content that will be forgotten within minutes.  Ask a tik tok user to tell you even 10% of the videos they saw within the last hour.  I&#39;d be surprised if they could.I hope its not too &#34;old man yelling at cloud&#34; because I do my 15 minutes of mindless instagram scrolling but I have a timer that locks the app and I usually only need 15 minutes, more just feels bleh.  Some of my family/friends &#34;brag&#34; about having 7+ hrs of &#34;tik tok time&#34; on their iphone stats.  Just crazy."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I love this.I have been a fan of SQLite for years, and it makes me genuinely happy to see other people have the same enthusiasm for the software.A couple of years ago, during a job search, I came across a couple of companies that I thought were a good match. I went through the interview process with all of them and, due to similarities in the interview process, we ended up talking about the same thing: databases. Oh the horror in the interviewers’ eyes whenever I mentioned SQLite. Experienced software engineers from The New York Times, for example, went as far as to mock my engineering choices in 3 out of 5 interviews, despite the success of the products my team built on top of SQLite.The experience made me feel awful and I stopped talking about SQLite for a couple of years. Instead, whenever someone asked a question about databases, I would answer with the PostgreSQL equivalent, knowing that the basic features are all the same.That is why, whenever I see projects like Litestream [1][2] used by excellent products like Tailscale [3], it brings me joy.A friend of SQLite is a friend of mine :-)[1] https://litestream.io[2] https://fly.io/blog/all-in-on-sqlite-litestream/[3] https://tailscale.com/blog/database-for-2022/"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"For people who enjoy this article I recommend reading the two-parter “How does SQLite work?” [1] [2] by Julia Evans. It too is an exploration into the inner workings but diving deeper into code. 
And for those interested in more details on b-trees, there’s “The Ubiquitous B-Tree” by Douglas Cramer which I enjoyed a lot.[1] https://jvns.ca/blog/2014/09/27/how-does-sqlite-work-part-1-...

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I dream of a SQLite-like embeddable database engine based on Datomic’s data model and queryable with Datalog. Written in something like C, Rust, or Zig. I’m toying around with the idea of hacking something up, but it’ll likely stay in the dream realm until I have Heaps of Free Time on My Hands (tm).Looking into SQLite’s innards is a great source of inspiration.

This is cute, but it doesn&#39;t actually do anything in most systems - either the employees all already get the marketing emails or there is a system-wide rule to suppress against the email domain.If you actually want to (potentially) break something, try submitting some obscure characters or malformed html into some fields. Blank spaces in emails can particularly be a nuisance.And if you want some real fun, some systems only enforce validation rules via client-side javascript. If you block them, you might be able to submit some real chaotic entries."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I used to get spam from a Chinese exporter who conveniently included their actual address in the emails. One day I happened to be visiting their city and went to their office and asked them to unsubscribe me in person. The lady was very confused and first thought I wanted to buy something. I showed her the spam on my phone and she agreed but didn&#39;t bother actually removing me. Just seemed to think I was a bit stupid for travelling so far (I was also a foreigner) to complain about a spam. It was interesting to see what those companies look like in real life though - an office filled with piles of widgets and cartons of deliveries everywhere. These Chinese exporter spammers do tend to be legitimate businesses and they can actually provide good cheap access to manufacturers but they harvest emails from everywhere if there&#39;s any hint you might work in a related industry."</p>

While current manufacturing is indeed dominated by East Asian countries, the vast majority of research still happens in US universities.

Every major power block heavily subsidizes strategic industries, now and forever. It&#39;s in no way new or remarkable, nor does it violate some principle. Most of the above concepts are pure fiction.Semiconductors are not a &#34;free market&#34; in any ordinary sense. It costs tens of billions to enter the market and you&#39;ll buy an ASML machine, speaking of dependencies.It&#39;s pretty obvious that this is in response to geopolitical instability. Being geo locked and this not really being a free market at all justify the &#34;unusual&#34; decision.As is stands, food, energy, and yes...also semiconductors are foundational to a modern digital society. And they&#39;re interconnected, without semiconductors you won&#39;t have food either.If you want to know what happens when semiconductors dry up, watch modern Russia. Arguably it&#39;s hard to do because of all the propaganda, but pretty much every domestic industry is falling apart, and therefore society falls apart.Bottom line, don&#39;t be naive. Sure it sucks to give rich companies even more money but if that&#39;s what it takes, so be it. Also, rich is just one side of the coin, the other is that they spear-headed the information revolution."</p>

There&#39;s no centralized service you could get all these parties to agree to use (not even Signal).The result of this is that everyone has an email address, and that makes it the universal standard for business-to-business communication. I can loop in any number of parties on a single thread from all over the world and it just works.My startup Shortwave is trying to build a messaging future that is email. We&#39;re trying to evolve and upgrade email to have the look and feel and features of a product like Signal, but with all the universal, federated goodness of the global SMTP network. It&#39;s a long project -- federated systems evolve slowly! -- but it&#39;s the bright open future I think we need. I go into some detail here: https://www.shortwave.com/blog/future-of-messaging/"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Context, for non-Nethack players:Nethack is one of the original &#34;roguelikes,&#34; back when that meant a text-console game based on `rogue`. It&#39;s an RPG where your character kills monsters, picks up loot, and descends into the dungeon. If you die, that&#39;s it -- you can&#39;t just load a save; you have to start all over. It&#39;s legendarily unforgiving.In Nethack, most (all?) roles start with a pet, e.g. a puppy or a kitten. In the early game, your pet is often stronger than you; it follows you, fights monsters, etc. It&#39;s useful in many ways beyond fighting: it won&#39;t walk over a cursed item, it can &#34;fetch&#34; items from stores without angering the proprietor, and so on. Your pet gains experience and levels up (puppy -&gt; dog -&gt; large dog), and after a certain point you&#39;re prompted to give your pet a name.The message &#34;You have a sad feeling for a moment, then it passes&#34; is displayed when your pet dies while out of sight. It&#39;s pretty difficult to keep your pet alive all through the endgame, so much like any real-life pet owner, there will come a time where you have to say goodbye, one way or the other."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Hidden gems like this were one of the great things about Everything2. For those who aren&#39;t familiar with it, E2 is structured vaguely like an encyclopedia, only instead of being a shared Wiki any user can write a whole separate article. Sometimes this was helpful for learning -- having three different explanations of what a tensor[1] is, for example. Sometimes it gave a mix of informational and personal content, such as the page on Mother&#39;s Day[2], which has one article on the history of the holiday and two about the authors&#39; attempts to cope with it despite losing or never having had a good relationship with their mothers. (Plus a summary of a Futurama episode by that name, because E2 was like that.)It also had an accidentally-fun feature in its hyperlinking system. Hyperlinks were intended to be used to be used for words that had their own articles, but you could link to any article, and when you hovered your mouse over the link the name of the target article would pop up. This could be used to make the closest thing I&#39;ve seen to an English equivalent of Japanese furigana puns. I&#39;m having trouble finding a good example right now, sadly.[1] https://www.everything2.com/index.pl?node=tensor[2] https://everything2.com/title/Mother%2527s+day"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; My own death, of course, which I learnt will come when I least expect it, when everything is going right for once - that when no threats are apparent and I feel I can relax a little, it will be then that I choke over a tin of spinach, or mistake a blue e for a blue o, or a pink h for a pink h.Just recently my wife developed a sudden and very aggressive infection. She&#39;s healthy and it totally came out of left field. Then it spread to me. It was definitely humbling. I don&#39;t believe in living in fear, but it&#39;s funny how everything can change in an instant.I have to commend the title though:&gt; You have a sad feeling for a moment, then it passesComing to understand the ephemeral nature of emotions is what finally allowed me deal with them. They&#39;re still real, but they always pass, no matter how strong they seem in the moment."</p>

It’s amazing how early we knew fossil fuels were destabilizing our biosphere.This man knew we were heading towards an uninhabitable world and screamed at the top of his lungs, but corporate growth was more important.  Persephone, indeed.He may have walked back his prediction of earth being largely uninhabitable by 2050,  but I have a feeling he was only slightly off.

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I can provide both anecdotal and academic data:Because companies have imperfect reading on worker productivity, and are also trying to balance other priorities when determining pay, high output workers are consistently underpaid, called Wage Compression (https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wage_compression)After getting a 2% raise in the last cycle, and knowing that my granted options were going to be worthless (a factor which is under-discussed in popular news articles), I decided that it was a particularly opportune time to jump. Like many, I was not particularly unhappy, so I had not been motivated to go through the effort for search process before.When I got an offer, my employer quickly matched it (suggesting that I really was worth that much to them) but burning a bridge with the contact you got me the new job was not worth  simply reaching parity in my current one, so they lost me. If they had preemptively gotten a few percentage points closer before I sunk effort into interviewing, I probably would not have started looking."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;ve had several chances to switch positions for considerably more than I make now (40-50% on my current six figures), each time I&#39;ve turned them down.I am happy and content where I am at, the job has good work life balance, it is for a good cause, and I make enough to provide comfortably for me and my family, this employer is also very stable so I don&#39;t have to worry about economic uncertainty.All in all I could make more money but I have found a level of contment and peace and it has allowed me to persue other hobbies outside of tech and serve in my local community.So maybe I am stupid and leaving money on the table, but I have found peace for now. For those who feel they need to make more I tell them congratulations that is awesome for you. But for now I am happy."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I really like reading about linguistic origins like that one. Makes me reflect on my irrational hatred towards reading &#34;could of&#34;, &#34;would of&#34; and the likes. I mean, I still get a seizure reading it, but I can only imagine some old dude yelling at the youngsters in the late 1800&#39;s like &#34;it&#39;s called &#39;and per se, and&#39;! Not ampersand! Jeez you all are the reason the english language is degrading!&#34;"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; The letter I, for example, would be referred to with the phrase I per se, I, which means in Latin &#34;I by itself (is the word) I.&#34; When the 27th quasi-letter &amp; was referred to it was called &amp; per se, and, meaning &#34;&amp; by itself (is the word) and.&#34; That read as &#34;and per se and.&#34;This explanation is mixed up and confusing. It isn&#39;t &#34;I per se, I&#34; that is somehow &#34;by itself I&#34;, it is merely &#34;per se I&#34;. The reason you get another &#34;and&#34; in front was because it was at the end of the alphabet song: &#34;[and] [per se &amp;]&#34;.https://en.m.wiktionary.org/wiki/ampersand&gt; Thus the end of the recitation would be: “X, Y, Z and per se and”. This last phrase eventually became ampersand, and the term was in common English usage by around 1837."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"One summer I had a job in the Penn library improving the catalog data for their medieval Latin manuscripts. The abbreviations were wild. Here is a handbook of them (which includes &amp; = et and &amp;-bar = etiam): https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/213385262.pdf (pdf). I can see how being &#34;literate&#34; was tougher then than now.There were different handwriting styles, depending on the writing speed (inversely proportional to the quality and thus expense). For example the Codex Sinaiticus is gorgeous: https://www.codexsinaiticus.org/en/manuscript.aspx?book=26&amp;c... (That&#39;s a Greek example, not Latin---sorry, I&#39;m not much of a Latinist anymore.) I guess if you don&#39;t have mechanical type, you are very motivated to speed up writing. The books I looked at were pretty hasty.Almost everything I saw was a treatise on medicine and biology. They were all &#34;commentaries on Aristotle&#34;. I guess that&#39;s what you had to do to publish in those days.Besides the paleography, I had to trace the origin &amp; date of the paper used, which was possible from watermarks. We had two huge reference volumes giving known watermarks so you could narrow things down a lot---but often you didn&#39;t get an exact match. There was a whole symbology there too."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"So the way I&#39;m reading the post is Tesla swapped out a battery pack for a 60 with a 90 and enabled the 90. Tesla, years later, discovers that even though the hardware for a 90 was installed it should have been software limited to be a 60. (I&#39;m assuming that Tesla only made the owner pay the cost of the 60 battery swap even though they replaced it with a 90). They go and &#34;fix the glitch&#34; and set it back to the 60. Since the new owner bought it thinking it was a 90, because it was enabled to be a 90, presumably paid for it assuming this was the case and is now upset because they don&#39;t have what they thought they bought.Sounds like all around bad decisions. The previous owner shouldn&#39;t have sold it as a 90 or at least disclosed that, &#34;It&#39;s a 60 but Tesla swapped out the batter with a 90 and left it configured as a 90&#34;. Tesla, being notified, should have just enabled the 90 and made the customer happy. How exactly are people supposed to abuse this? Tesla put the 90 in there and they&#39;re the only ones who are going to be doing that. Presumably this cost them a fortune to do it in the first place. Why not get some good will out of it? &#34;Hey sorry about your battery. We only had a 90 so we threw that in there. Enjoy. Tell everyone you know about how awesome Tesla was about fixing the problem and remember that next time you go to buy your next car&#34;"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;ll spare the moral judgements against Tesla for this:The real moral of the story here is that if your business plan and practices is creating occasional weird issues and huge cognitive dissonance in your customers, it&#39;s the wrong business plan.  Also... the number of people this applies to is likely so low that Tesla really screwed up by not erring on the side of the customer.  (They didn&#39;t buy from Tesla, but they&#39;re still a customer buying servicing from them.)  If the bad publicity alone causes even a tiny fraction of the population to choose another manufacturer, the&#39;ve lost their $4,500 and then some.Harmony is a really underrated concept.  When things are harmonious, you don&#39;t have problems like this, and you can still make money."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&#34;I feel like this is more mundane on Tesla&#39;s part than many are making it out to be.
A mistake was made years ago. An employee recently discovered and &#34;fixed&#34; it. 
Terrible communication and customer service, but nefarious? Nah.&#34;At this point I feel like terrible communication and service is an intentional business strategy for some companies who found that by making support so baroque as to be inaccessible or just eliminating it entirely that they can slash costs accordingly. I do consider it to be nefarious in such cases."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This is not a good article. At a technical level it&#39;s confused about a whole bunch of things:* SMM has been part of x86 for decades. The Secured Core requirements around SMM actually reduce its power.* The claimed requirement to remove the third party UEFI CA certificate from 2022 Secured Core PCs is entirely unrelated to Pluton (it&#39;s required regardless of whether Pluton is enabled or not, and even whether the CPU has Pluton or not)* Most of the description of Pluton is actually a description of a TPM. You don&#39;t need DICE for remote attestation. TPMs are already a hardware keystore.* System firmware is already being updated via Windows Update. The discussion about Pluton and Windows Update is around Pluton getting firmware updates that way (the existing story around firmware updates for TPMs is largely not good)* Existing TPM-based remote attestation already includes the secure boot stateThe short version: everything that the article is worried about being enabled by Pluton is already possible, and has been for years.But there&#39;s a meaningful point here. Remote attestation can certainly be used to restrict access to resources in ways that are incompatible with general purpose computing, or which reduce user choice. Remote attestation can also be used to give end users confidence that their machine is in a good state without constraining what they do with it. As a technology, remote attestation can be used in both good and bad ways. We do need to keep track of whether anyone is threatening to use it in bad ways and react appropriately.(But tbh remote attestation as an attack on general purpose computing isn&#39;t the really scary thing about widespread remote attestation. Remote attestation ties back to the TPM&#39;s endorsement key, an immutable cryptographic key certified by the TPM vendor at manufacturing time. The straightforward implementation of allowing arbitrary remote sites to trigger remote attestation would tie all of these accesses back to a single piece of hardware, and would be a privacy nightmare.)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;m completely missing how his example of a Word document that can only be opened by approved users on approved hardware within the corporation is supposed to be a bad thing.Honestly, that sounds pretty fantastic. I&#39;ve been using 3rd party tools/extensions to do this sort of thing in corporate and government environments for years, but having the attestation go all the way down to the hardware level is a big value-add, especially with so much ransomware/spyware/extortion/espionage going on these days.Can someone please explain to me how the author might see this level of security as a bad thing?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The thing I fear the most with this is &#34;proof that secure boot has never been disabled&#34;. This is just a way to brick your device from accessing services.What if you government&#39;s tax service requires such proof? Or bank? I cannot count how many machines I booted on Linux to rescue a hard drive, or image it, or wipe it, or just to install linux on them. All those devices, boom, paperweight for regular personal use.I hate it so much that Microsoft is alone in this. It&#39;s not because it&#39;s M$, it&#39;s because they&#39;re alone on it."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I have background here and can take a pretty good guess at what happened. You used a Brex card, which Google sees as a “privacy card.” These are often used by scammers trying to circumvent Google blocking their credit card account numbers.The solution here is to never use a hidden or “privacy” card number with Google, although of course Google will never tell you that or confirm or deny this. I only know this due to working with clients in this area.You can try removing that card and adding a regular hard card number and asking for a reinstatement again, but it may be too late for this account.Hopefully this helps folks reading this to not make the same mistake (although it’s incredibly frustrating that stuff like this has to be learned by trial and error or knowledge from those of us who have dealt with this previously.)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I have had nearly this exact experience, marketing a small SaaS.A sudden ads suspension arrived, with no explanation beyond &#34;suspicious payments&#34;. This from the same billing account used with GSuite, Domains, GCP; and from a business that was having no trouble running ads on FB, Twitter, and Reddit. &#34;How silly, but I&#39;m sure we can get it fixed&#34;.. I thought.Like OP I&#39;m also a Xoogler, so after two rounds of unsuccessful appeals through the front door (including updating my payment account to a hard card, providing articles of incorporation, and so on, to no avail), I figured it was time to call in my first ever favor. Surely one of my old-timer engineer buddies could thunk a ticket somewhere and maybe we&#39;d help them fix a bug in some automated system in the process.But the Google of 2022 is far different than the earlier days. It seems individual employees, even well-placed engineers, have incredibly and increasingly limited agency to fix things outside their immediate purview; a wiki about internal escalations for ads suspension stated they were no longer accepted, vaguely for reasons of &#34;compliance&#34;.On the bright side, the whole episode made me rethink and ultimately diversify our technology dependency on Google.

For me it is one of the reasons I will *never* build on Google Cloud.Combine this with their propensity to randomly shut down services and also jack up the prices of things by some wild amount overnight with no warning or justification. (Google Maps API and Kubernetes control plane.)I would never consider risking all of my work on Google&#39;s reputation which is a shame because I&#39;m sure the services themselves work relatively well. It feels like everyone outside of google is widely aware of these issues but everyone inside is completely blind to them.Side Note: has anyone ever &#34;won&#34; an appeal with Google or does the system deny 100% of appeals?"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This seems extremely clever.I know Mullvad already allows you to e.g. send cash in an envelope for total privacy, but that&#39;s kind of a pain, it&#39;ll take a long time to arrive, if the envelope is lost there&#39;s nothing you can do, etc.But by physically printing covered-up codes on cards, this actually uses Amazon to create the privacy/anonymity, which kind of feels ironic given how Amazon generally tries to hoover up all the data. You can get your code with fast Prime delivery, a tracking number, pay for it with your credit card, get a free replacement if it&#39;s lost in the mail...I love this."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Kind of surprised this hasn&#39;t been mentioned yet, but it&#39;s pretty commonplace to buy gift cards with cryptocurrencies. So there&#39;s yet another layer of anonymity if you buy an Amazon gift card from a stranger/service then use it for a physical Mullvad activation code."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"While I generally believe it to be possible, I am very curious about how Mullvad is storing its payment records to avoid time-based correlations.For gift cards it&#39;s more async, but given that payment processors keep records that can be correlated, if Mullvad isn&#39;t careful about timestamping, how it records crediting to accounts, or the like, it would be extremely easy to de-anonymize account relations IMO."</p>

Volume is now lower than it was way back in 2020.The crypto down rounds are going to be hilarious.Note to investors: if you’re investing in crypto projects, carefully consider the ponzinomics and the vesting schedule. You want your unlocks to happen in the middle of the bullrun when exit liquidity is ample.And also remember that whatever you might think of as “normal”
volume will crash 90%. And when you think it has stabilized, it will crash 90% more.The number of investors who bought the top is hilarious. But then, this is also a field where risk management is treated like a sin."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Helium isn&#39;t your typical crypto company.  Their vision is actually very lofty - build a distributed low data wireless network completely independent of phone providers and cable companies.And pay the people who own nodes a percentage of the $ earned thru the traffic flow of their node.The payment just uses crypto because the ecosystem is a nice fit.  Everybody knows what miners are and that they make money.The problem is that you need the entire network in place before people can build on it.  So they have been subsidizing the miners.  And it&#39;s a race of how much money can you raise and payout vs how much is a network like that is worth.And right now everybody has cellular and cable and fiber and no one really needs another system.  Most of the use cases (LOTS of sensor data) aren&#39;t really worth that much money.Personally, I think the government should subsidize something like this to allow it to get off the ground.  Earthquake data, climate data, traffic data, etc.  Essentially public use."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I looked into getting a Helium hotspot, but when I looked at my ISP‘s terms of service, the Helium use case is explicitly forbidden (I use Frontier Internet in Florida.)If you’re not familiar with it, what a Helium hotspot does is allow compatible IOT devices to share your Internet connection.I suspect that allowing random third parties to use your Internet connection it’s explicitly forbidden by the terms of service of most ISPs, especially when you are being monetarily compensated/rewarded for such sharing.Excerpt from ToS:
“Customers may not retransmit the Service or make the Service available to anyone outside the
premises (i.e. Wi-Fi or other methods of networking).”"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"What really helped me understand and troubleshoot network communications at the socket level was the book by W. Richard Stevens[0]. I think this is because he starts with an introduction to TCP, and builds from there. Knowing TCP states and transitions is important to reading packet dumps, and in general debugging networking.Also, no matter what platform you&#39;re using, there is probably a socket implementation somewhere at the core. You&#39;re best off understanding how sockets work, then understanding how the platform you&#39;re working with uses sockets[1].Once I read the W. Richard Stevens book, I was able to read and understand RFCs for protocols like HTTP to know how things should work. Then you&#39;re better prepared to figure out if a behavior is due to your code, or an implementation of the protocol in your device, or the device on the other end of the network connection, or some intermediary device.[0] - http://www.kohala.com/start/unpv12e.html[1] - https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/winsock/porti..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"One of the big issues with TCP is a lot of communication isn&#39;t well-suited to the stream model and is message-oriented, so yes, like the author says, you have to go implement ACKs. And then you want multiplexing, which streams also fail at. Before you know it, you built a worse version of HTTP2."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; How you handle a file no longer existing vs. a socket disconnection are not likely to be very similar. I&#39;m sure I&#39;ll get counter arguments to this,That&#39;s my cue! I think the &#34;everything is a file&#34; is somewhat misunderstood. I might even rephrase it as &#34;everything is a file descriptor&#34; first, but then if you need to give a name to it, or ACL that thing, that&#39;s what the file-system is for: that all the objects share a common hierarchy, and different things that need names can be put in say, the same directory. I.e., that there is one hierarchy, for pipes, devices, normal files, etc.I&#39;d argue that the stuff that &#34;is&#34; a file (named or anonymous) or a file descriptor is actually rather small, and most operations are going to require knowing what kind of file you have.E.g., in Linux, read()/write() behave differently when operating on, e.g., an eventfd, read() requires a buffer of at least 8 B.Heck, &#34;close&#34; might really be the only thing that makes sense, generically. (I&#39;d also argue that a (fallible¹) &#34;link&#34; call should be in that category, but alas, it isn&#39;t on Linux, and potentially unlink for similar reasons — i.e., give and remove names from a file. I think this is a design mistake personally, but Linux is what it is. What I think is a bigger mistake is having separate/isolated namespaces for separate types of objects. POSIX, and hence Linux, makes this error in a few spots.)But if you&#39;re just writing a TCP server, yeah, that probably doesn&#39;t matter.&gt; and that you should write your applications to treat these the same.But I wouldn&#39;t argue that. A socket likely is a socket for some very specific purpose (whatever the app is, most likely), and that specific purpose is going mean it will be treated as that.In OOP terms, just b/c something might have a base class doesn&#39;t mean we always treat it as only an instance of the base class. Sometimes the stuff on the derived class is very important to the function of the program, and that&#39;s fine.¹e.g., in the case of an anonymous normal file (an unlinked temp file, e.g., O_TMPFILE), attempting to link it on a different file-system would have to fail."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I sort of owe callgrind a big chunk of my career.I was working at a company full of PhDs and well seasoned veterans, who looked at me as a new kid, kind of underqualified to be working in their tools group. I had been at the firm for a while, and they were nice enough, but didn&#39;t really have me down as someone who was going to contribute as anything other than a very junior engineer.We had a severe problem with a program&#39;s performance, and no one really had any idea why. And as it was clearly not a sophisticated project, I got assigned to figure something out.I used the then very new callgrind and the accompanying flamegraph, and discovered that we were passing very large bit arrays for register allocation by value. Very, very large. They had started small enough to fit in registers, but over time had grown so large that a function call to manipulate them effectively flushed the cache, and the rest of the code assumed these operations were cheap.Profiling tools at the time were quite primitive, and the application was a morass of shared libraries, weird dynamic allocations and JIT, and a bunch of other crap.Valgrind was able to get the profiles after failing with everything else I could try.The presentation I made on that discovery, and my proposed fixes (which eventually sped everything up greatly), finally earned the respect of my colleagues, and no phd wasn&#39;t a big deal after that. Later on, those colleagues who had left the company invited me to my next gig. And the one after that.So thanks!"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I wish I hadn&#39;t read this article because now I know that I&#39;ve been mispronouncing Valgrind for nearly 20 years but I&#39;m not going to stop.(Kidding. Thanks for Valgrind! I still use it for assessing memory corruption vulnerabilities along with ASan.)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I once submitted a bug fix for an obscure issue to valgrind. They asked for a test case, which I managed to provide, but I was a bit nervous as I couldn&#39;t immediately see how to fit in their test suite.The response from Julian Seward was so nice it set a permanently high bar for me when random people I don&#39;t know report bugs on my projects!We still run our entire testsuite under valgrind in CI. Amazing tool!"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I have been a user of the Language Tool API as we&#39;re building (experimenting with?) a language learning app [1] and grammar correction is a key component. I really want to love it, and I&#39;m so appreciative of the open source version that has allowed us to get going, but it&#39;s just so... limited. I haven&#39;t really dug into the code, but I gather that it is very rules based and that seems destined to fail because so much of language is context sensitive.For example, it really can&#39;t determine in German if you&#39;re using the correct case or not for a particular verb. Or it can&#39;t really tell if you&#39;re using the right prepositions.Ultimately, we ended up building a grammar engine just for language learners using transformers [2] + a version of errant [3] we ported to be multilingual. It&#39;s not perfect, but after a couple weeks of development was more helpful than LT.1. https://squidgies.app2. e.g. this paper from Grammarly https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.12592, but there are a bazillion others3. https://github.com/chrisjbryant/errant"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"    This periodic adjustment mainly benefits scientists and astronomers as it allows them to observe celestial bodies using UTC for most purposes

This is incorrect, dealing with leap seconds is a major problem in astronomy, requiring a data file or even recompile any time there is a new one announced.  Since they are only ever announced 6 months in advance, it creates a lot of logistical problems.Astronomy algorithms usually work in Barycentric Dynamic Time, or Terrestrial Time, or UT1.  In reality the whole invention of UTC is so that people don&#39;t have to deal with those systems on a daily basis.The process most astronomy programs go through is to get the UTC from the user, convert the Gregorian date to a Julian day number to get rid of the Gregorian Calendar altogether.  Then look up the number of leap seconds, add those to the JD to get International Atomic Time, then add 32.184 seconds to get Terrestrial Time.  If Barycentric Dynamic Time is needed, you must first compute the velocity of the Earth relative to the solar system barycenter (which itself requires TDB), then compute the relativistic effects of that motion on Terrestrial Time.  If you need UT1, these can only be obtained by observation from the International Earth Rotation Service, and required daily updates, and interpolation of values in between observations.So, as you can see, leap seconds do nothing to make an astronomer&#39;s life easier.  In fact, we jump through a lot of hoops to make the average person&#39;s life easier.  It sounds like Meta wants to change the definition of time for everyone just to make their programming a little easier.  I find the very premise just out right ridiculous.It&#39;s true that your average person will not be affected by the Sun setting a few seconds earlier.  But eventually it will build up enough error that it eventually has to be addressed, and Meta is just trying to make their problem someone else&#39;s problem."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Everyone is treating this as some idiosyncratic proposal of Facebook&#39;s, but removing leap seconds is a mainstream position.  Representatives of the US, China, France, and a majority of other countries were in favor of this when it was discussed at the 2015 ITU meeting [1] though the UK and Russia&#39;s were not.  This has been under discussion since at least the 2003 ITU meeting in Turin.[1] https://www.nature.com/articles/nature.2015.18855"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Can&#39;t help but agree with 80% of this post but strongly disagree with the solution. This feels like a hack that punts the problems to the future.UTC has the leap second cause it&#39;s not &#34;real time&#34; and so now we&#39;re just gonna never sync up UTC to real time at all? How is that the solution? Either we deal with leap seconds or we need to implement something that can&#39;t go backwards and properly models time. Leap seconds seem much simpler...In the end we didn&#39;t get rid of SQL cause of SQL Injection. We fixed the frameworks and promoted the solutions. We may simply need to make a push for languages and etc to just properly support time and promote how to do things correctly. It honestly seems easier."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"In my experience on small teams that I&#39;ve been on - a key motivator for people is shipping products and features. The sooner and more frequently you can do this the more positive reinforcement there is for the entire team - not to mention reduced risk of something never making it to the target users.Teams that have figured out the optimal way to get product and features into the hands of users as quickly as possible are the happiest teams because it&#39;s evidence that they&#39;re working together efficiently to meet their shared goals."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is why when leading an engineering org I narrowed down to one metric:Committed to Completed RatioIt encourages completing things and only committing to what you can complete.It&#39;s legible, easy to understand by engineering, product, and management, pointless to game, and positively reinforces completion. It&#39;s quite difficult to accurately predict when a complete feature will ship, let alone a whole product. But, if one breaks down a feature into its legible constituent components and then commits to completing just what is within that (which also necessitates any required communication to arrive at understanding the requirements) then over time you can get quite good at predicting what you will be able to get done in a sprint and better at only committing to what you believe you can actually complete."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This article is very thorough, but makes one fairly big mistake: it assumes there is low variability in task size.This could be a reasonable assumption if you&#39;re very good at adjusting scope, but I would be skeptical unless you have measured it and have the numbers to prove that in practise, tasks indeed turn out to be roughly the same size (±20 % or whatever -- I don&#39;t know the exact threshold.)Why this matters is that under cheap context switches and even modest task size variability, it&#39;s -- surprisingly -- a performant queuing policy to pre-empt the currently processing task to handle every incoming task. The intuition behind this is that if a task is still processing when a new one comes in, it&#39;s likely to be a &#34;big&#34; task, and it&#39;s worth letting small tasks ahead in line. Reduces mean response time.Of course, this could all be moot anyway because context switches are certainly not cheap for software engineers. I just thought I should mention it for nuance. Rules of thumb only get you so far, at some point you have to more accurately model the situation and simulate."</p>

It&#39;s in the same price range as a lower end UTV and looks like it would be far more comfortable doing, e.g., snow clearing duty. Swap in a set of BFG Mud Terrain tires and you&#39;re all set.Some feedback on reliability, the rust issues, etc. would be nice but I&#39;d seriously think about getting one. As for it not being street legal, well I live out in the country. Golf carts, UTV&#39;s, ATV&#39;s, minibikes, on the roads around here are not at all unusual.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Re: the Rust optimized implementation, I was able to get ~20-25% better performance by rewriting the for loops as iterators, using Rust&#39;s byte range pattern matching, and a buffered writer, which seems crazy, but it&#39;s true.  I chalked it up to some crazy ILP/SIMD tricks the compiler is doing.I even submitted a PR[0], but Ben decided he was tired of maintaining and decided to archive the project (which fair enough!).[0]: https://github.com/benhoyt/countwords/pull/115"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"For those curious about Rust optimization, the “optimized” version makes three changes compared to the “idiomatic” version:* It uses byte strings instead of UTF-8 strings. In my opinion, that’s not an optimization, that’s changing the problem. Depending on the question you’re asking, only one of the two can be correct.* It uses a faster hash algorithm. It’s not the first time this came up in a benchmark article. Rust’s decision to use a DOS-safe hash by default (and not provide a fast algorithm in the std, like other languages do) really seems to hurt it in that kind of microbenchmark.* It uses get_mut+insert instead of the more convenient HashMap::entry method, because the latter would require redundantly allocating the key even in the repeat case. I’ve hit this problem in the past as well. Maybe the upcoming HashMap::raw_entry_mut will make this kind of optimization cleaner."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I love using the UNIX shell (pipes and programs that do &#34;one thing well&#34;) to the point where it hurts my ability to improve at other other languages. But sometimes all you need is a throwaway command to do something once, not a beautifully optimized function that will be written, improved, compiled, profiled, reoptimized and then executed a billion times. The utter tersity of a bash one-liner just tickles me."</p>

I struggled to figure out if pipes were allowed to run out of bounds, whether they all had to be connected into a single network, and the significance of the bulb-ended ones. I&#39;m not totally dense and could make some guesses, but this still made the puzzle less than approachable for me at first. Basically I just guessed at these things, tried to see if I could solve one, and once I did and saw my complete solution all was clear. But why not state these things up front? Or maybe that&#39;s part of the puzzle? :-)My first solve took 9min, then 3, then 1.5min for my third."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I looked into GNS a little while ago and what I understood about how it works is:1. I runs on top of GNUnet, which is a huge DHT that can be used for any purpose you like.2. So GNS aims to replace DNS with a newer &#34;modern&#34; protocol, it is not a alternative root zone (like Handshake or such), nor does it decentralize the root zone, it just decentralizes &#34;DNS&#34;.3. How it is supposed to work is, instead of OS bootstrapping using root servers, they are preloaded with a root zone public key (possibly belonging to ICANN) or a list of TLDs (with corresponding owner public keys). Then the key owner can publish zones signed with the corresponding keys on the DHT, which recursively contains keys for child subdomains. It&#39;s like if torrent and DNSSEC had a baby.4. To lookup a domain, you do a request with (tld, pubkey) and verify the response, do this recursively for each label until you have the record you want.5. The problems with DNS it solves is: censorship (DNS is very easy to intercept and censor), query privacy (I don&#39;t know how this works, they don&#39;t seem to use onion routing or something), and secure resolution.One thing to note here is development on GNS started in the 2001s, this was before DNSSEC and DoT/DoH were a thing, and most of the DNS was unsecured (which albeit even is today), and this could have been a completely viable approach."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This might be an unpopular opinion, but I think that decentralized DNS, and decentralized naming in general, is one of the few use cases that can be neatly solved by a blockchain, but is extremely hard to solve any other way.A major problem when designing a decentralized naming system, or any naming system at all really, is preventing malicious users from grabbing all the cool names for themselves. The only way to do this is to make acquiring domains costly, and blockchains are a perfect way to enforce that in a decentralized manner. Other problems include accurately tracking domain ownership and letting the owners transfer domains to others, which cryptocurrencies have solved long ago. As an added benefit, because all domains in such a system are owned by a public key, we suddenly no longer need a root of trust for TLS, instead, we accept any TLS certificate signed by that public key."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; How can a legitimate domain owner tell other people to not use his name in GNS?&gt; A: Names have no owners in GNS, so there cannot be a &#34;legitimate&#34; domain owner. Any user can claim any name (as his preferred name or &#34;pseudonym&#34;) in his NICK record. Similarly, all other users can choose to ignore this preference and use a name of their choice (or even assign no name) for this user.This is confusing me. How is it not a problem that randoms can just claim other people&#39;s domains?"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I also think that C# and .NET are awesome. Especially latest releases dotnet 6 and upcoming 7 have a ton of new things to be even more productive.I like the fact, that you can develop command line apps, Web APIs, Desktop Apps and smartphone apps all with the same toolset, including the fact that deployment is possible on nearly every major platform for every major platform (except iOS and macOS Apps, as always only on macOS). Even systems programming and AOT is doable or full featured static deployment is possible integrating a small runtime into a single binary.And boy is .NET fast...This facts made Golang pretty interesting to me, but what I did not like here is the lack of a usable cross platform Plugin-Loader technology, most of the stuff has to be monolithic, then the module management and some of the missing concepts (like generics, which is also now available in go).The sheer amount of concepts in C# is overwhelming (from basics like Generics to less common ones like Extension-Methods, operator overloading, etc.).I don&#39;t like Visual Studio as IDE, but VS Code is an acceptable alternative tool, although I personally prefer the non-free JetBrains Rider.Nuget package manager also has it&#39;s caveats, e.g. that the official repo can only &#34;unlist&#34; packages, not delete them or that the publish times sometimes have horrible delays, but that&#39;s also still acceptable, since you can use the github package registry or bring your own to overcome these issues.Technologies on my todo list include getting into MAUI (a cross platform UI stack) combined with Blazor[1], which can use Web Components in native UI apps and develop TRULY cross platform (Web, Desktop AND Mobile with the same codebase). Like electron, but without the browser dependency due to native integration.Although everything is tied pretty tight to Microsoft, there is a huge open source community developing cross platform libraries, that are easy to use. Even though i find that microsoft has often made strange decisions in the past, the current state is clearly a recommendation to have a look.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2eIsQ3Pm2bE"</p>
