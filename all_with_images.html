								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"In the movie The War Lover, Steve McQueen (well, the actual pilot) pilots a B17 bomber &#34;cutting the grass&#34;, i.e. flying low with the gear up. The stunt was to be done with models because it was too dangerous.My dad was in the AF at the time, and was assigned to the movie as a consultant on AF trivia. He convinced them that the stunt could be done safely, and explained how to do it.And so it was done. My dad got in trouble, because if the B17 had crashed doing the stunt, the AF would have looked bad. But it didn&#39;t crash, and the stunt was a big deal to the movie crowds, so he was forgiven.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGGynxYbA48It&#39;s still freakin&#39; impressive today.His other contribution to the movie was the mission briefing wall maps."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The most fascinating non-CGI effect from Terminator 2 is a cut scene which can be seen in the director&#39;s cut, where they use Linda Hamilton twin sister in a surprising way: to fake a &#34;mirror&#34; scene where Sarah is operating on the Terminator&#39;s head.They are in front of a mirror. They wanted to actually use Arnie in the reflection to show his face; they wanted a dummy for the head closest to the camera, to show the surgery inside the head. So they used a window in the wall instead of a mirror! Linda Hamilton and her twin sister are mimicking each other&#39;s movements to make it seem it&#39;s a mirror image.(The other use of Linda&#39;s twin sister, the scene where the T-1000 fakes being Sarah, is better known)"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"As more data comes out about Google, Apple, Amazon, one simple underlying thing becomes clear: a single company cannot be trusted to operate a marketplace while also being a participant.Apple&#39;s App Store insider knowledge lets them discover popular apps, then boot them off the platform when they decide to compete. Amazon sees what products are successful and profitable, then makes knock-offs which they promote over the originals. And now, reading into this, Google is manipulating their ad markets using inside knowledge.It&#39;s all very profitable.If we cannot trust large companies to not abuse this kind of power, then they should be prevented by law from playing both sides. This may result in the breakup of some very large companies, akin to the 1934 Air Mail Act that broke up Boeing."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; The lawsuit also highlights Google&#39;s use of a secret program dubbed &#34;Project Bernanke&#34; in 2013 that used bidding data to give its own ad-buying an advantage. For example, in a 2015 iteration of the program, Google allegedly dropped the second-highest bids from publishers&#39; auctions, accumulated money into a pool and then spent that money to inflate only the bids belonging advertisers who used the company&#39;s Google Ads. They otherwise would have likely lost the auctions, the states alleged.Can someone rephrase this and possibly explain like I&#39;m five? I&#39;m not following the mechanics..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Still waiting for investigators to look into Chrome.In 2009 we were finally getting rid of IE and the web browser market was a healthy ecosystem with lots and lots of innovation happening.Today we are soon back on a browser monoculture with the owner of the most popular product being a company that has enormous interest in killing certain parts of the ecosystem and also has a long history of killing of their own products.How did it happen? In my opinion: massive abuse of power in two other markets (search and ads) to push their way into browsers as well. (Well, I&#39;m feeling I might have been too generous above: I could add 2 more - video and office tools - by pointing how they selectively make Google Docs and YouTube perform worse in Firefox, being so brazen about it that just changing the headers so that Firefox identifies itself as Chrome makes the problems go away.)"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"When another thread pushes a socket to be processed by the socket polling thread, the socket polling thread calls select() on that function. Since select() is a blocking call, when another socket is pushed to the socket polling thread queue it has to somehow interrupt select() so the new socket gets processed ASAP. How does one interrupt select() function? Apparently, we used QueueUserAPC() to execute asynchronous procedure while select() was blocked… and threw an exception out of it!Not taking anything away from the great debugging, but that is just incredibly bad design and reeks of bugs from a mile away. System calls block for a reason. If you can&#39;t handle the blocking, how about a non-blocking architecture? But in this case, the engineer thought &#34;hey, I don&#39;t want to block on my precious main thread, so let&#39;s just give this blocking thing to another thread, that&#39;ll surely solve it!&#34;. Except it doesn&#39;t when you use that same thread as a worker to execute all other thread&#39;s blocking crap ... but then write the queue push() function to be blocking as well!Keep it simple folks. Bad design always breeds more bad design."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I read this and couldn&#39;t shake the feeling that it&#39;s a fantasy tale because it mentions the mystical Unity support engineer who actually fixes bugs - the one I haven&#39;t been able to get a hold on for the past 5 years, despite having critical bugs escalated by support... But then I noticed this is from 2016, so before they started kicking out experienced people to polish their profit margin for the IPO.Still an amazing debugging story, though :)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"From the article: &#34;Surprisingly, setting up kernel debugging is extremely easy on Windows.&#34;Microsoft (at least used to) take developers very seriously. The OS actually plays along when you&#39;re trying to debug things, and Windows error reporting actually sends you data that you can work with.Say what you want about their business practices, but I&#39;d deal with Microsoft&#39;s developer support over Apple&#39;s anytime.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"RTings, a site that reviews (amongst other things) televisions, maintains a list of fully ad-free models:https://www.rtings.com/tv/tests/ads-in-smart-tv(They are the ones with &#34;10&#34; in the ad-free column)The dominant brand for ad-free models is in fact... Vizio."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;ve had my Vizio TV (P55-F1, 2019 model; a mid range model) for about 2.5 years now. Image/sound quality is great. But the annoyances and overall mediocrity of the OS and its updates [0] made me just disconnect the TV from the internet and fully switch over to using an Apple TV for all consumption rather than using the native Vizio OS.[0]: The OS is terrible and the remote randomly stops working sometimes. Sometimes the TV would take tens of seconds to turn on, but then other times it was near instant.Every single update since I&#39;ve gotten the TV seems to make the TV even slower/more laggy. There was even an update about two years back where the Youtube app&#39;s volume was inexplicably an order of magnitude lower than every other input&#39;s volume (e.g. a volume of 100/100 on the Youtube app ended up being equivalent to a volume of 10/100 for all other apps/inputs). It took Vizio 1-3 months to fix it.Unblockable ads on the home screen and genuinely multi-hundred millisecond response times on the app launcher infuriated me."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is likely incorrect.The $57.3 million is for the &#34;Platform+&#34; division. It includes profit from homescreen ads, selling of buttons on remotes, and cuts of streaming revenue. It&#39;s likely that only a small fraction of the division&#39;s $83 million in revenue comes from tracking and then selling viewing habits."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"On a similar theme, I remember reading a story about a server that would crash mysteriously every couple of weeks. They eventually worked out that this happened whenever there was a new moon or a full moon, and the resulting high tide caused a battleship moored in a nearby harbour to rise just high enough that its powerful radar would interfere with the server."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; &#34;When did this start?  A
few days ago, you said, but did anything change in your systems at that time?&#34;&gt; &#34;Well, the consultant came in and patched our server and rebooted it.&gt; Having established that--unbelievably--the problem as reported was true,
and repeatableAs far as problems go, this is an easy one to solve. Accurate description of the problem. Accurate reporting of what changed. Problem is consistently repeatable.Compared to a problem that doesn’t reliably reproduce and for which the person reporting it claims nothing changed, this one is child’s play.But it’s still amusing to read every time.I had something similar occur in the early 2000s on a patch release of Solaris 2.6 (I think) where the sleep call was broken and would always return almost instantly. This caused all sorts of weird behaviors on the running system.I also recall the first time I ran into an issue with MTU on a dedicated frame relay link we had to admin our web farm in the late nineties. One day a developer reported they could login to our bastion but when they ran “ls -l” in a big enough directory their ssh connection would hang. It turned out the connection would hang whenever a packet was generated near the MTU and we eventually tracked it down to an issue with the frame relay connection. We played with MTUs until we found out what worked. It then took a while to convince our provider what was going on but they eventually replaced a line card on the far end of the connection which allowed us to re-raise the MTU to 1500.Another fun problem I had was an email to SMS gateway I wrote for myself that worked by posting to a Verizon web form. I developed it on a Mac (probably 2002 or so) where it worked fine but when I deployed it to my Linux box on my same home network, the script couldn’t connect to Verizon’s site. It turned out the Linux box was a setting a flag on the TCP connection (ECN I think) that was tripping up Verizon’s web firewall. The work-around was disabling ECN on the Linux box."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This reminds me a problem I&#39;m currently having.  My iPhone freezes completely sometimes when I ride BART, requiring a hard reboot.  I notice it happens when passing the Daly City station.  It seems there&#39;s a strong signal tower nearby that the strong signal causes the problem.  It&#39;s probably the strength level read by the hardware causing an out of bound error somewhere and corrupting the phone&#39;s memory."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This brings back great memories. Windows 2000 sparked my interest in computing.I was in elementary school and was obsessed with the &#39;Log on to&#39; 
dropdown box on Windows login screens, and how you could use the same credentials on any PC.Somehow I managed to salvage an old computer and source myself a copy of the ISO and managed to setup an ADDS domain controller and join my mother&#39;s laptop to the domain.I went and asked the IT guy for advice on doing a multi forest configuration and I think it blew his mind.

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I actually cut my sysadmin teeth on Windows 2000, and found myself wondering how on earth they could `docker exec` a shell. These were, comparatively, the dark ages of Windows administration, and almost all tasks were done through a GUI.The implementation is nothing short of genius: they use a Windows version of `netcat` (the common UNIX tool, but compiled for Windows from the Windows 2000 Resource Kit), then use `srvany` (also from the Windows 2000 Resource Kit) to start `netcat` as a system service, but with `cmd.exe` piped to its standard in and out.Kudos on this solution!"</p>

In particular, number theory and data structures are two fields that I have come to love almost entirely because of this website. I did a random selection of the first 200 problems on my own about a decade ago but ran out of steam as the problems got harder.Recently, however, I introduced it at work as a way of encouraging the team I manage to work collaboratively. We have a fortnightly catch up where we talk through solutions, pick new problems (we have a script that randomly picks an easy, medium and hard problem, which has become an exciting ritual), and then we have an initial discussion about each of the new problems.It&#39;s a good way to foster group work. It&#39;s also a great way to introduce people to using version control and pull-requests in a non-scary way!"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&gt; When people buy access to a service via a subscription in an iOS app, they are essentially Apple’s customers. For privacy reasons Apple does not provide much information about them to the apps or businesses that run the apps. That means it’s hard to do customer service, address issues, or solve any problems.&gt; “The user experience is much worse,” a marketing executive from one company told me. “When you buy with the developer, they have a relationship with you ... when you buy from Apple: sorry, you’re Apple’s customer, not ours, and if you have a problem with a subscription … we can’t really help them.”Now interview a real user of subscriptions instead of a brand marketing executive and ask them if the user experience is worse.PS. Even when not confronted with such a piece, remember that Forbes is no longer the business journalism folks may have grown up with.  For the past decade, it’s a blogging platform for independent contributors:&gt; Each contributor flies solo with his own blog. He is responsible for conceiving and creating the content, ensuring its accuracy and building an engaged, loyal readership.

								<p class="story__comment_others">"That Apple would do this is interesting, but more interesting to me is Google&#39;s position, and obligation, here. There was a throw-away line in the article about Google &#34;not doing anything about it&#34;. What could or should Google do about it? Has Google mediated between competitive ad-buyers in the past? I am not sympathetic to goog in general but it seems like that line puts them in a no-win situation: either they err for not doing anything, or they err for doing something (but not the right thing). Indeed, in this case it would seem the corrective action would better come from Apple than from Google. (Also note this whole play feels like Apple trying to get creative with ways to productively bleed off ridiculously huge capital reserves in a low risk way.

I posted this in our company slack room as an example of how not to act for bizdevGoogle benefits too much from this sort of arrangement to have any incentive to stop it, even though these are unauthorized advertisements that are specifically against Google&#39;s AdWords TOS (side note, I wonder if there is a legal avenue to follow when a vendor doesn&#39;t follow their own TOS? An interesting thought...).This is also a recurring issue with all of Google&#39;s advertising revenue -- malicious behavior such as fraudulent clicks, unauthorized ads, etc., are a decent portion of the revenue stream, and Google is financially incentivized to keep these sorts of abuse going until the ruse is up and the accuracy of their system is called into question publicly in a way that scares away advertisers, but with NDAs and corporate secrecy, it is far too easy to keep things unbalanced, and keep abuse like this in the dark.Business models like this demonstrate just how dire the need for regulation is in some areas of the tech world, particularly among FANG."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The beginning of this article is a fairy tale that ignores what used to be one of the biggest drivers of revenue for banks: overdraft fees. Maybe the HN crowd has never been in a situation where they were auto-billed into a negative balance, which then caused an overdraft fee that then further drove their balance into negative territory, but this was a weekly/monthly fiasco for millions of Americans.I was once in a meeting with one of the senior executives at JPMorgan, where the guy smugly told me he felt they were “doing a service for the community” by charging people overdraft fees. After leaving the meeting, my very senior colleague said, “I had to hold myself back from throwing that guy out of his window.”These sorts of articles — half PR, half history lesson — tend to leave out these sorts of politically inconvenient but important bits of history. It’s so much work to unpack the bias..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; Typically, the apps offer their users a choice: payouts at the speed of banking, for free, or payouts at the speed of the Internet, for a small convenience fee. Cash App charges 1.5% with a minimum of a quarter.This is just another way the financial system (including fintech startups) preys on the poor. If you are well off, you wouldn&#39;t want to pay any convenience fee for the privilege of receiving money from a business a few days earlier. In fact, you can think of it as interest: from first principles if someone delays a payment to you, theoretically they should pay more because of interest; now if you opt for waiting 3 days and saving the 1.5% convenience fee, you would effectively earn an interest of 1/(1-0.015)-1 = 1.5% in 3 days. That&#39;s not even an annualized figure. If annualized it would be 1.5%/3*365=122% implied annual interest rate. No one in their right mind who does not have cash flow issues would opt for receiving debit card payments with such a fee.&gt; Many report that it transforms the nature of their interaction with the underlying application; delivery driving for casual drivers becomes something that you can burst up to fill an immediate cash need or mentally allocate against a particular desired expenditure (e.g. “Drive for 3 hours to afford a night out starting immediately after you log off.”)If your cash flow is not an issue and have credit, this is how you would handle it: let&#39;s drive for 3 hours, receive the full payment amount in a few days instead of immediately, and put all the charges from the night out on a credit card, whose bill will become due in a month or two, with no interest. But the poor doesn&#39;t have a bank account or a credit card, so they suffer. They pay more in fees. That&#39;s the injustice of the system."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&gt;Here&#39;s why I like SSH signatures:&gt;* It&#39;s not PGP.The most important reason people use the OpenPGP message format is because it is a well accepted standard. Sure the cryptography is not new and fun but it is secure. If you sign something with OpenPGP then you can be sure that those signatures are verifiable on any platform by anyone. The OpenPGP standard has provisions to ensure that the signatures are from a particular entity. This proposal suggests that Github could be treated as a trusted third party. If that is the case then you don&#39;t need signatures at all.Obligatory &#34;The PGP Problem&#34; rebuttal:* https://articles.59.ca/doku.php?id=pgpfan:tpp"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; GitHub acts as a trusted third party here, and you have to trust them not to lie about people&#39;s public keys, so it may not be appropriate for all use cases. But relying on a trusted third party with a professional security team like GitHub seems like a way better default than PGP&#39;s Web of Trust, which was nigh impossible to use.Hopefully that&#39;s a false dichotomy and the entire Free Software community doesn&#39;t end up reliant on Microsoft to host all our keys for us.  The article goes on to mention key transparency, though, which does seem like the right solution.I note that rekor (the transparency log implementation used by sigstore) already supports signing with SSH keys[0], so this TechRepublic article about it[1] from March (which lists only &#34;GPG, x509 and Minisign&#34;) is already out of date.[0] https://github.com/sigstore/rekor/blob/main/types.md#ssh[1] https://www.techrepublic.com/article/a-new-linux-foundation-..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Regarding PGP&#39;s &#39;Web of Trust&#39;, I thought the purpose of this was to validate the link between the key and the owner of that key.  This is not what you get from retrieving a public key from github... that only gives you the link between that key and a github account.  But what does that give you?From what I understand, it gives you nothing for anything that is signed and that does not have a direct link to a github account.  Obviously, if someone releases software on that github account and I find a signed release of that software, I can validate that it really was signed by the official source of that software on github. For anything that does not have that direct link, it really does not give you anything.I&#39;ve never used PGP, but I thought the web of trust was used to validate metadata on the key and that this can be used to validate that a key really belongs to the person that you think it belongs to.  I saw it more like how you have SSL certificates with different degrees of validation and where you must deliver more proof of your identity if you want to receive a certification with a higher degree of validation.I&#39;m all for using SSH keys for signing, but I still would like to have something like PGP&#39;s web of trust for those keys."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"  We have been made aware of &#34;scary&#34; emails sent in the last few hours that purport to come from the FBI/DHS. While the emails are indeed being sent from infrastructure that is owned by the FBI/DHS (the LEEP portal), our research shows that these emails *are* fake.

https://twitter.com/spamhaus/status/1459450061696417792"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The email domain where the messages originate is from some sort of federated identity management system that was created in 2010 (here is a proposal deck [0] with technical details). Found this program simply by searching Google for the sending domain.Based on the guide for using this system [1] (see step 15) looks like this specific email address is the one that sends automated confirmation emails upon registration. Perhaps someone was able to inject a message instead of the regular canned text through some sort of reflection attack? This explains why replies to the message result in a canned response. The system also now appears to be temporarily down. So it’s getting some sort of attention (internally taken down (most likely) or maybe denial of service from the abuse).The Reddit thread suggests the recipients’ emails are likely ARIN IP range contacts. Those are very available from tools like this [2] so nothing interesting with that, but the real question is WHY someone would do this at all? This was clearly given some thought (on who to send this to who would actually take the time to verify the headers) but given the sloppiness of everything else, is this just a script kiddie flex? Whoever it is pissed off the FBI and gained absolutely nothing.[0] https://bja.ojp.gov/sites/g/files/xyckuh186/files/media/docu...[1] https://www.justice.gov/tribal/page/file/1260671/download[2] http://itools.com/tool/arin-whois-domain-search"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Lots of people commenting that the text of the email seems amateurish. Perhaps it’s exactly as it should be, but you don’t understand its purpose. Maybe they wanted this to be discussed on netsec forums everywhere, so that Google searches for “Vinny Troia” always lead back to discussion about this email, framing him as a cyber criminal and outranking legitimate posts about or by him - an online identity assassination. They needed the email to set off some alarm bells so that it would pique enough interest to be widely discussed. They appear to have widely targeted the email addresses of system admins. I’m fairly certain this was their intention.Also, does it strike anyone else as odd that the account that posted this to HN was created hours ago, for the sole purpose of starting this thread?"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"(Portuguese here)
Portuguese Parliament and Government publish law every day and afterhours[1], as a citizen I have to keep up with this. MPs believe they are doing a great job by producing more Law, instead of checking if what is in place is accountable. A common behaviour is when a &#34;crime&#34; case is well covered by the media, the first thing is said &#34;we need to change the Law&#34;, trying to dodge blame.I have been working remote for 17 years, and the teams I worked in, work asynchronously. It is fine to text, slack, discord and email after hours, people don&#39;t expect to get answers immediately, they will reply according to their schedule or contract.One case is that employers have to compensate employees for electricity and utilities for working remote, in my case that is a cost of €10.58, I save much more for not commuting, financially and psychologically.[1] https://dre.pt/dre/home"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Can we open up a broader discussion about Portugal&#39;s culture of work? On one hand this sends a message that Portugal cares about work/life balance for everyday citizens. On the other my general impression of Portugal&#39;s economy is that it&#39;s one of the weaker members of the EU. High debt, not a huge driver of innovation, wealth, etc. These are all just loosely held beliefs kicking around in my head. I&#39;m not attached to any of them or sure that they are even accurate."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I DM my staff on slack “after hours” [1] all the time, and set the expectation that they should respond when appropriate at their discretion. That could (and often does) mean the next business day or even later. Or it could mean ASAP; they’re adults, and have the judgement to make the correct call.[1] Obviously, this policy is not targeted at staff in different time zones, which makes their remedy meaningless."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Reading this really drove home to me just how amusing some of the twists and turns of music tech development are. In contemporary modular synth formats, you now have modules that use similar FM tone chips, but are controlled by potentiometers and analog control voltage inputs (for instance, https://busycircuits.com/alm011/). I could see how someone could conclude that this destroys the reproducibility advantages of digital FM synthesis, while preserving the cheesiness of FM sounds. From another perspective, you can freely explore the enormous landscape of sound produced by FM synthesis, without diving into the deep end of DX7 programming. Instead of generating sysex dumps on the fly to dynamically change the sounds produced by the synth, you just feed whatever control voltage you can come up with into the inputs of a module and bask in the insanity that comes out (for instance—https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-YEbg040ww definitely not everyone’s cup of tea).Edit: but if you want to explore the landscape of FM tones generated by these chips without spending all of your money on a modular setup, generating sysex messages will of course take you where you want to go: https://fo.am/activities/midimutant/"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is maybe a little outside the scope of your article, but I&#39;ve read about the DX7&#39;s log2 based sine wavetables in the past, and it makes sense from a math standpoint (log2(x) + log2(y) = log2(x*y)). However, I find it confusing when I go to try to replicate it. My understanding is that these are NOT floating point numbers. In which case the output would be in the 8bit range of (0-257) or -127 to +127 if we&#39;re using signed values.So assuming I want to represent a signal value of 127 (i.e. sin(t) = 127) using base 2 logs, I punch this into my calculator and i get log2(127) = 6.9886.
But that&#39;s not what&#39;s going to be stored in the signal LUT since it&#39;s a floating point number.I think I&#39;m probably missing something obvious, but any clarification would be amazing."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"While I agree with the author in principle, I think there is an implicit criteria they ignore, which is the intuitive correctness from the perspective of the user.Imagine a user chooses &#34;Sort by rating&#34;, and they subsequently observe an item with an average 4.5 ranking above a score of 5.0 because it has a higher Wilson score. Some portion of users will think &#34;Ah, yes, this makes sense because the 4.5 rating is based on many more reviews, therefore its Wilson score is higher.&#34; and the vast, vast majority of users will think &#34;What the heck? This site is rigging the system! How come this one is ranked higher than that one?&#34; and erode confidence in the rankings.In fact, these kinds of black-box rankings* frequently land sites like Yelp into trouble, because it is natural to assume that the company has a finger on the scale so to speak when it is in their financial interests to do so. In particular, entries with a higher Wilson score are likely to be more expensive because their ostensibly-superior quality commands (or depends upon) their higher cost, exacerbating this effect due to perceived-higher margins.So the next logical step is to present the Wilson score directly, but this merely shifts the confusion elsewhere -- the user may find an item they&#39;re interested in buying, find it has one 5-star review, and yet its Wilson score is &lt;&lt; 5, producing at least the same perception and possibly a worse one.Instead, providing the statistically-sound score but de-emphasizing or hiding it, such as by making it accessible in the DOM but not visible, allows for the creation of alternative sorting mechanisms via e.g. browser extensions for the statistically-minded, without sacrificing the intuition of the top-line score.* I assume that most companies would choose not to explain the statistical foundations of their ranking algorithm."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This article inspired me so much that I based my shitty undergrad senior thesis on it. My idea was to predict the trend of the ratings by using I think a trailing weighted average, weighted to the most recent window. It managed to generate more &#34;predictive&#34; ratings of the following 6 months based on the Amazon dataset I used, but I doubt it would have held up to much scrutiny. I learned a ton though!Edit: Link to paper, which looks like it actually attempts to use a linear prediction algorithm. https://github.com/rkuykendall/rkuykendall.com/blob/e65147f6..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;ve been using this at work for the last year or so to great success.For example, we have an internal phishing simulation/assessment program, and want to track metrics like improvement and general uncertainty. Since implementing this about a year ago, we&#39;ve been able to make great improvements such as:* for a given person, identify the wilson lower bound that they would not get phished if they were targeted* for the employee population as a whole, determine the 95% uncertainty on whether a sample employee would get phished if targetedIt lets us make much more intelligent inferences about things, much more accurate risk assessments, and also lets us improve the program pretty significantly (e.g. your probability of being targeted being weighted by a combination of your wilson lower bound and your wilson uncertainty).There are SO MANY opportunities to improve things by using this method. Obviously it isn&#39;t applicable everywhere, but I&#39;d suggest you look at any metrics you have that use an average and just take a moment to ask yourself if a Wilson bound would be more appropriate, or might enable you to make marked improvements."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"My experience with learning math is that the first months are all about backtracking. You have to fill all your holes.It&#39;s basically one big graph of concepts.The tricky part is, most beginners simply don&#39;t know how to navigate that graph.They see complex numbers with their exponentials and cos/sin forms and shut down.They can learn all these concepts no problem, but finding what they need to learn defeats them."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Reading the foreward&gt; These  de­finitions, which are not at all simple for the  
&gt; beginner,  came  to  be  used  in  the wrong  context.  
&gt; Textbooks  presented them  before  any explanation  was 
&gt; given of  the  theory and its applications, there­
&gt; by  complicating  an  understanding  of things  that  
&gt; were  intuitively  clear.hear hear!This problem is like most of the Wikipedia pages that I come across on &#39;complex&#39; topics of not just maths but anything remotely intersting technically. I just give up in the end. Life is too short to be bothered with some editor&#39;s &#39;dick measuring&#39; competition about how clever they."</p>

Furthermore, you’re now one of the small group of people with ”hosting“ IPs. Using self-hosted SearX may make you easier to track, not harder.Using SearX hosted by someone else is marginally better, but now you have to trust the owner of the server, which is probably not what you want for privacy-centered search engine."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Note that if you’re building a framework with the intent of using Linux avoid the “vpro” variant of the Intel wireless adapter:https://community.frame.work/t/using-the-ax210-with-linux-on...Last I checked with every recommended config tweak you still lose ~3% battery per hour of suspend, which really adds up and is extremely annoying.We’ve been asking framework to include a notice referencing this issue when configuring but as of the last time I checked they haven’t."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"From https://frame.work/blog/linux-on-the-framework-laptop :“ There has been immense interest in this configuration, with it outselling pre-configured systems with Windows 10 by a wide margin.”There is a market. And it is currently under-served."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;m typing this on my Framework now and I have to say it really is a special device. The prevailing culture of treating technology as disposable is something I personally don&#39;t vibe with - I always keep all of my tech and have collected machines over the years that most people would probably consider obsolete and uninteresting (there&#39;s an Amiga 1000 and iMac G3 currently in my field of view). Having a fully open machine that I can customize, upgrade and repair for the foreseeable future is just so cool and makes me feel like this is my personal computer in the truest sense of the word!A few takeaways from using it for around a month now:1. This is the most &#34;premium&#34; feeling non-Apple laptop I&#39;ve ever owned. Most of the laptops I&#39;ve ever daily driven are Macs or Thinkpads so take that for what it&#39;s worth, but I think most people will be happy with the fit and finish of this device.2. The swappable port system is actually a lot more useful than I expected. I initially thought it would be something I set up once and didn&#39;t bother with again for a while but there are a lot of random moments where it comes in handy. I&#39;m kind of a messy, hyper person that periodically reorganizes my desk and I like to move between different workspaces when I need a different setting to feel creative. Being able to move my HDMI or USB-C ports around for better cable management is so nice and yeah I could use an external hub but I&#39;ve always found those to be annoying on-the-go and just &#34;feels bad man&#34;. Also I don&#39;t use Micro SD cards as much as other people but there are times when I do and being able to swap that in is really kewl.3. Linux support is amazing but there are still a few hiccups. I use Arch Linux and everything works perfectly except for one minor inconvenience with Bluetooth: on a soft restart, the Bluetooth is disabled and I have to do a hard restart to restore it (can be mitigated by a kernel downgrade and should be fixed in a future update). It&#39;s not a deal breaker for me as I usually just close my laptop and put it to sleep, but just know that it&#39;s like running Linux on most other computers - you&#39;re going to have a much better time if you&#39;re fluent in tinkering and configuring your OS.4. The 3:2 display is awesome for programming and content creation, and I don&#39;t know why more devices don&#39;t adopt it. My only criticism is that it&#39;s not a touch screen but with how modular this laptop is it&#39;s only a matter of time before that becomes an option."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&gt; I hope this article will inspire people to look at e-bikes as potentially commuter car replacement, to send Bosch and other e-bike technology manufacturers a message that if they won’t supply what people need that they are going to have to live with people hacking their stuff and to get people to comment on the way the thing works, what they would do with it and how it could be improved or how I could work better/safer on stuff like this.i bought a Onewheel-XR+ a few months ago and then found a lot of reddit threads about how the mfg DRM&#39;d the controllers to prevent people from adding longer range batteries and buildig their own apps to do diagnoatics over bluetooth. they sent cease/desists to several prominent modders.it&#39;s super sad. the modding community was very vibrant until they kneecapped it via firmware updates.their android app is bloated 42MB crap with social features that requires an internet connection and google&#39;s framework to connect over bluetooth to the board under your feet to read battery levels, change riding modes, control headlights, etc. previously there were third party apps &lt; 1mb that could be used offline for this, until they crippled everything via firmware updates.now they released their new GT boards a month ago with extended range (and much heavier). the new Pint GT looks really compelling, so really torn about giving these sh*theads more of my money :(https://old.reddit.com/r/onewheel/comments/l2vhra/future_mot...https://old.reddit.com/r/onewheel/comments/kcl816/4209_or_ne..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Awesome project Jacques! I saw a comment of yours on an article a day or two ago and was hoping to see this pop up soon.I&#39;ve found the most difficult thing about riding an e-bike is the other motorists have no idea how to react to you. You&#39;re not really a regular bicycle anymore due to your speed, but you&#39;re also not a motorcycle that deserves its own lane. I have at least one car turn in front of me almost every trip out just because they&#39;re misjudging my speed. I get honked and yelled at when on the road because folks get frustrated when I&#39;m using the left-hand side of the right-turn lane as a bike path.Sidewalks/bike paths tend to be a lot less safe in residential areas as well, since cars coming out of their driveways really don&#39;t expect an e-bike to come rolling through. I&#39;ve learned to dramatically reduce speed in areas like this.Aside from those things, I love it! I ride the e-bike whenever I&#39;m going somewhere in range (I live in Florida so things tend to be spread out) and the weather permits. My bike gets about 80km which is more than enough for anyplace I want to go on a bicycle anyway."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"What bugs me is so much of our (Australia&#39;s) government&#39;s policies over time have increasingly deferred to some ISO standard or another. These days most agencies / departments are stipulating some form of ISO27k compliance from vendors, a standard that can only be purchased from ISO.Given we pay our taxes to the government, and I would have thought defining policy standards was one of the services we pay tax to have (what better thing for governments to do than what they&#39;re naturally geared towards - bureaucracy?), at the very least they would be able to directly and in detail outline the standards they expect and not simply handball the entire definition and auditing off to an international organisation and myriad consultancies with the stroke of a single bullet point requirement in the RFx.The quagmire of ISO consultancies are often charging exorbitant rates to deliver essentially a set of Excel templates, when the hard work of adopting a standard really is all in-house and any company with a copy of the standards and the templates can pretty much get it all done internally then get certified.And ultimately when it comes down to it, the standard doesn&#39;t really do much to improve quality outcomes, especially for an organisation that doesn&#39;t give a fig. A well intentioned company that&#39;s on the ball will already be following best practices, a shady company that plays cowboy will do the bare minimum to get the badge.Anyway, just an axe I tend to grind. Standards definitely are needed and have their place but holy hell is it a mess ATM. There needs to be an independent open source standards body, ISO is a farce IMHO - the standards as they are written are actually decent but their business model and hands-off approach to auditing and verifying standard adherence is a big issue across multiple sectors I think."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I did recently discover that the Estonian standards agency makes ISO standards available, not for free, but significantly more cheaply than other sources I found when trying to locate standards (although I didn&#39;t end up using it so don&#39;t know any more than is on the public Web site): https://www.evs.ee/en/"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"100% agree!I am very angry that standards that were paid for by taxpayers around the world were then given by governments to the ISO who then charge for very minimal work done afterwards.For example, BS3939 was created by the UK Government for electronic symbols and as far as I know, has not been updated since 1991 when an ISO document took it over. Why would they, therefore, be charging $250+ per copy for it?I think there should be a phrase like &#34;immoral bureaucracy&#34; which pertains to the extraordinary amount of money a quango burns through compared to what they actually produce. Since most ISO docs are produced by experts and not by the ISO themselves and since many of these do not change frequently, the cost is immoral imho."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"There are a ton of little errors in this post (at the time of my leaving this comment, of course): the variable delimiter example is missing the close _, the first word example is missing the open &#39;, and the except line 5 example is missing a space; meanwhile, these snippets will cause bad habits, such as thinking about &#34;words&#34; as &#34;things involving letters&#34;, using -r instead of -E, and a massive knowledge gap with respect to appropriate use of semicolons... I&#39;m also really confused as to why sed is suddenly &#34;s&#34; in one of the examples. This just isn&#39;t a very good reference, and I&#39;m not sure if the author thinks about how &#34;c&#34; works, but it really needs a \ afterwards, no matter what the one specific version of sed you are using might allow :/. As someone who loves sed so much he nigh unto regrets how much he uses it: &#34;beware&#34;.FWIW, I&#39;d argue that the path to true sed mastery eventually goes through the hold space, which isn&#39;t mentioned here. For some real fun, and an exercise that might change how you mentally model what sed is capable of, check out SedSokoban.https://aurelio.net/projects/sedsokoban/"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I really dislike sed, awk, and all these utilities because I just can’t remember how to use them. Every time I want to use one of these tools I have to relearn the stuff, and then after a while I forget how to use it. If I don’t use it all the time I just forget. I really don’t think non-interactive CLIs are a good way to do complicated tasks."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Nice descriptions, but some of them need changes to match the command. For example:    sed &#39;1~2p&#39; file.txt #needs -n option

    s &#39;1,$ s/foo/bar/&#39; file.txt #s --&gt; sed and 1,$ --&gt; 5,$

Many commands using `-r` do not need the option for the command used (for ex: `sed -r &#39;/start/q&#39;`). Also, using `-E` is preferred instead of `-r` since some of the other implementations support this option but not `-r`.---I wrote a book on GNU sed with plenty of examples and exercises: https://github.com/learnbyexample/learn_gnused It is free to read online and there&#39;s a detailed chapter for learning BRE/ERE regex flavor as well."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I am so happy to see the quick progress of Linux on the ARM-Macs. In the 80ies and 90ies, there were several competing processor architectures on the market, but for the last 20 years for PCs it was x86 only. With the Apple Silicon, there is now a real contender, actually surpassing the current x86 offerings in many aspects. And that is, why competition between architectures is so important. And of course just interesting from a software development perspective.With Linux becoming a viable option on those machines, they become interesting for a far wider audience than just the MacOS users. Thanks to the great work by Alyssa, GPU acceleration should be close too.Then lets see when Linus gets himself a Mac, he already indicated that he would be interested to do so as long as he doesn&#39;t have to port Linux himself."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I was surprised by glxgears/OpenGL running, but in a later tweet I read this:&gt; It&#39;s been running the glxgears demo (60% all-core CPU usage)Looks like it&#39;ll be a while before this thing runs Linux with anywhere near acceptable performance if glxgears still runs in software at 60% CPU."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The only motivation for me to own Apple hardware in 2021 is the ability to use FOSS software in the natural habitat of Linux.I don&#39;t trust Apple&#39;s software and &#34;ideas&#34; of computing at all.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I&#39;ve tried to incorporate some of the ideas of the &#34;second brain&#34; and it didn&#39;t really give me that much. My lessons:1. It&#39;s always super helpful to write things down. Taking notes from what I read/learn is a great way to verify that I understand it. It sharpens my thinking.2. However, maintaining the &#34;second brain&#34; is a lot work. It&#39;s not only about &#34;linking&#34; together notes. You also need to maintain some consistency between them. I ended up spending a lot of time thinking about the structure instead of actually thinking about the content.3. Most of my notes/thoughts fall into two categories: (1) Either they are critical for something I&#39;m actively working on or (2) it&#39;s just loose concepts that I&#39;m toying with. For (1) I immediately end up playing with it in code — which is far more concrete and tangible than notes. And for (2) it was rarely important to retain the knowledge accurately many weeks/months later.What I&#39;ve ended up with is taking a lot of notes, but I hardly focus on organizing them."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I use textfiles...Some are lists, like todo.txtSome are individual topics, brainstorms, etc.For organizing them, I put hashtags like #food inside.Even thousands upon thousands of textfiles (which I&#39;m nowhere near) grep quickly, archive and backup quickly, and transfer to other systems quickly, without lock-in or putting my eggs into someone else&#39;s basket.I can even build my own UI on top of it... First, index them into a SQLite, then generate some HTML from it, and have a form which puts another textfile back into the directory. Best of all: the UI never changes without my consent.After getting burned repeatedly by third-party systems with stupid UI changes, data migrations, just plain shutting down, leaking my data, your version is out of date, and your OS is not compatible with our new version, and your device is not compatible with the new OS version, etc., there&#39;s no way I&#39;m using a third-party system for this ever again."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I recently read &#34;Getting Things Done&#34;[0] and began incorporating what I learned into my simple second brain. And the results are kind of ridiculously good for me.I built my whole system on a Google Sheet, but I&#39;m experimenting with building myself an App instead- something I would never have been able to accomplish or even been willing to start if I didn&#39;t have this second brain helping me.The lessons I&#39;ve learned from this:1. Being pro-active on things instead of reactive makes everything easier. Each action takes less work because there&#39;s no worry or guilt associated with it. Just a small amount of planning to make myself pro-active is a worthy investment.2. Putting things I need to remember into a system and then forgetting about them, trusting that my system has it under control, removes a huge cognitive load from me. I have more energy to use elsewhere.3. Building a system that evolves to fit my needs, being flexible with myself, rather than trying to jam myself into someone else&#39;s system has made it work at all. That&#39;s why Google Sheets is awesome as a prototype tool for this.[0]https://gettingthingsdone.com/"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This was definitely written by a pythonist!  If I tried to write it, as a rubyist, I&#39;m sure I&#39;d get some things about python wrong.  (I find it notable how few people there are that are actually familiar with both).The standard alternative to `for` in ruby does involve `each` and blocks... but definitely doesn&#39;t involve defining a custom `each` method on your class... That is a specialty thing that most developers have probably done rarely.  Let alone defining it in terms of `for`, which is just weird!But the basic principle stated &#34;Instead of passing data back to the for loop (Python) you pass the code to the data (Ruby)&#34; -- is more or less accurate.blocks -- syntactic support in the language for cleanly passing a single in-line defined lambda/closure object as an argument -- are possibly the thing that are most special to ruby.&gt; Python builds on for-like constructs for all kinds of processing; Ruby pushes other kinds of data processing work to methods.OK, maybe, although not totally sure what you mean.&gt; Ruby keeps going with its methods-first approach, except instead of each we have a new set of methods commonly implemented on collections, as below:Um. I&#39;m not sure where the author is getting this. It is certainly possible, as shown, but definitely not common to implement `select` or `map` or other methods provided by Enumerable directly on your custom class. It is a bit more common to implement `each` alone and let the `Enumerable` mixin provide the rest.  But even that I&#39;m not sure how &#34;common&#34; I&#39;d call it.&gt; Ruby, however, inverts this. Ruby puts object-orientation as the foundation of the pyramid. Ruby contains the messy procedural world in blocks, letting objects work with those procedural blocks.OK, true. The author is getting the details wrong, but I guess their overall picture is still right?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"While people have pointed out that this is not idiomatic:  class Stuff
    def initialize
      @a_list = [1, 2, 3, 4]
    end

    def each
      for item in @a_list
        yield item
      end
    end
  end

I haven&#39;t seen anyone point out the deepest reason why: unlike in many languages, “for” is not a basic, low-level construct in Ruby, it is  syntax sugar. That is:  for x in y
    x.stuff
    more_stuff
  end

is sugar for:  y.each do |x|
    x.stuff
    more_stuff
  end

(Also, for quite a long time, for...in also had runtime overhead , so it was slower syntactic sugar.)for...in is rarely used (it is syntactic sugar that is neither more concise bor more specific in intent, but more familiar to people with experience in non-Ruby languages), and mostly on scripts that consume but don’t implement collections. If you are getting deep enough to be implementing an #each method for a custom collection, that&#39;s an odd place to use for."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"For me, its the explicitness in Python that is killer.  I can see a name and match that to an import and match that to a package.  Grabbing a function pointer works exactly as I would expect.Stealing from Krister Stendahl&#39;s laws for religious discourse, Ruby&#39;s composable iteration is one area I have holy envy, particularly after I got used to it in Rust.  I&#39;ve used Python&#39;s generators many times just to have to switch to an explicit for loop.  Things are generally better with a composable iteration model but occasionally I find myself switching to explicit loops in Rust.Unlike Ruby, Rust does pull-iteration like Python, though there are experiments with Ruby-style push-iteration [0] [1].[0] https://github.com/AndWass/pushgen[1] https://epage.github.io/blog/2021/07/pushgen-experiment/"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"It&#39;s interesting, but always calibrate their claims against the fact this is about the tenth time this movement has come around. This movement literally goes back to COBOL. That is not a typo. It&#39;s not only likely older than you are, but probably much older than you are.I recognize COBOL may not seem like &#34;no-code&#34;, but that&#39;s just because &#34;no-code&#34; is a stupid label. &#34;No-code&#34; doesn&#39;t mean &#34;no code&#34; just like &#34;serverless&#34; still runs on a server.I would say the main problem with the no-code hype is the idea that it is a leader. It is not. It is a follower. &#34;Normal&#34; code goes out, hammers things out over the course of literally decades, and then, when it has finally settled what the best couple of ways to do something is, it&#39;s finally time for the &#34;no code&#34; solutions to come in and systematize that for a larger audience. Nothing wrong with that. Power to the people and all that.It just goes wrong when no-code advocates put the cart in front of the horse and make grandiose claims about replacing all developers or something. That&#39;s not the direction the stream flows in. No-code can&#39;t operate without the &#34;normal&#34; developers doing immense amounts of work charting the territory and building the infrastructure to get there. There is no chance of them displacing &#34;normal&#34; software developers; they are structurally incapable of it. Woe unto the no-code startup that doesn&#39;t understanding this dynamic, and foolishly tries."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is an imperfect analogy, but consider for a moment the role Microsoft Excel plays.Excel allows non-coders to do many useful things, and provides a relatively gentle on-ramp to actual code via formulas. If you take that on-ramp and keep going, towards VBA and add-ins and other pieces of Microsoft technology, you might wind up becoming a full-time software developer, leaving Excel behind and using “real” tools.Now, there’s a happy path and an unhappy path here.The happy path is that you use Excel for what it’s good at, but recognize when you are operating at its limits, and at that point pivot into “real” software engineering tools.The unhappy path is that you stick with Excel too long and become mired in the world of VBA and advanced formulas and attempts at shared workbooks, and build pseudo-database application-contraptions.No-code can be like that early Excel usage: it can grant some limited but useful powers to non-developers. But no-code can also evolve to become like those contorted, unmaintainable spreadsheet monstrosities that stretch the technology far beyond the point where some “real” software engineering would have been the right answer.Short version: use the right tool for the job."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I am an engineer with 20+ years of hands on keyboard, I&#39;ve got projects that are now part of Apache, 1000&#39;s of stars on github. I&#39;ve been CTO at a number of startups that have got significant funding. My point is to establish some credibility. I probably still suck.Having said that, I have been working with Microsoft PowerAutomate for the past 1.5 years and while it has saved a lot of time and been overall a good experience, there are times when the no code/low code gets in the way and I wish I could just &#34;drop into code&#34; to get something done. Examples are things like data validation. 
This technology is not going to replace coding, the paradigm shift is really happening for people in the marketing and sales operations parts of the business. For these folks, this tech is life changing.
In a lot of ways, this tech felt like when you try a new framework in your language of choice; at first it&#39;s super easy and you get hyped, and then you hit a requirement where the nocode/lowcode environment really gets in the way."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This isn&#39;t a joke; I had actually scheduled a lunch with Lowtax for this Saturday.  Despite a (let&#39;s call it) checkered past, I was extremely excited to meet him, since he&#39;s been a huge influence to my sense of humor and Something Awful was really important to me as a teenager.-------I had found him on LinkedIn a few weeks ago, and simply sent a message explaining that I&#39;m a fan, would love a chance to buy him lunch and chat about Something Awful and Gaming Garbage.  To my surprise, he responded back with &#34;sure, I&#39;d be up for it&#34;.I responded back with &#34;How does early December sound to you? something on the order of December 11?&#34;His response was &#34;shit I dont even know if I&#39;ll still be alive then&#34;.  This response was a little weird, but this isn&#39;t exactly &#34;off brand&#34; humor for Lowtax, so I ignored it.I then say something to the effect of &#34;how about something along the lines of November 13?&#34;, which he said was better. He then said &#34;and you have my permission to stab me&#34;.  Again, not off brand for Lowtax.I bought a plane ticket to Kansas City, was ready to fly out this friday.  But I had this deep feeling in my stomach that what he was saying wasn&#39;t just a joke.  It&#39;s pretty well documented that he&#39;s been depressed, and I dunno, upon re-reading his messages a hundred times I got a dark feeling that these might be kind of bad omens. What exactly do I do with this?  I discussed it with my wife and a friend, who weren&#39;t sure what the best solution was, and I ultimately decided not to say anything.  I figured I&#39;m just some dork who stalked him on LinkedIn, and I was afraid that if I said anything he would think I&#39;m weird and cancel our lunch date.And now this shit happened. He finally did it, and now the thought keeps playing in my brain of &#34;what if I had said something a few weeks ago?&#34; I know I don&#39;t owe him anything, but I can&#39;t help but have this repeated feeling of &#34;I valued an opportunity to meet my man-crush more than I valued someone showing suicidal tendencies,&#34; and it makes me feel downright rotten. That&#39;s not the kind of person I want to be, and it makes me feel legitimately sick that that&#39;s how my brain decided to work.At some logical level I know none of this is my fault really; realistically even if I had said something, I doubt much would have changed, and I doubt I had enough there to get him committed or anything, but there&#39;s a difference between logically knowing something and feeling something.As it stands, I think there&#39;s a reasonably good chance that I will feel partly responsible for this for the rest of my life.  This sucks.--------RIP Rich.  I know you had a rough last couple years, you were the definition of a &#34;complicated person&#34;, and despite everything you will be missed."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"He leaves behind a complicated legacy. It&#39;s important to note that credible allegations of domestic abuse lead him to sell SA in the past year, and this can&#39;t be set aside.At the same time, SA&#39;s influence on the modern internet can&#39;t be understated. The &#39;image macro&#39; of early SA (maybe created by Lowtax himself, from what Fragmaster says in his video in the link) is the direct ancestor of today&#39;s common meme image--impact font text over a silly image, easily accessible to anyone who wants to post it.Many of today&#39;s well-known internet comedians and writers grew up with the site. And it&#39;s hard to estimate how big the impact (positive or negative) of things like ADTRW leading to 4chan have been, not to mention things like the rise of Let&#39;s Play videos, or the creation and eventual shutdown of BitTorrent Barnyard (and its ensuing spinoffs).The site itself still remains one of the last vestiges of the old internet--one of the few sites that both survived and managed not sell out and go headlong into monetization--and as a result, is one of the last sites on the modern internet that (maybe ironically) is not entirely awful."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I used to visit SA regularly. A lot of the humor was tasteless, but nowhere near the level of the chans. I avoided the forums, and only read the front page stuff.What kept me coming, was that they were amazing writers (it wasn’t just him -or he wrote under several nom de plumes).His essays, done in the style of famous writers, and deadpan humor, where a story seemed serious, up until the point that you suddenly realize you’re being punked, were masterful.But it sounds like his personal life was a disaster. I have known a number of folks like that. In most cases, I always hoped that, one day, they would “come out of the cesspool,” and start to realize their potential (I have also known a number of folks that did that, too). In my experience, these people were absolutely miserable, and difficult to be around. I only ever saw his creative output, so had no other stake in his personal life.I wish his exes and children the best. It sounds like they may need it."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This seems to be kind of a complex topic, with a number of variables.
Here is a study:How physical text layout affects reading from screen
https://www.researchgate.net/publication/220208446_How_physi...A quote from the Discussion section:
&#34;Most of the studies on line length report faster
reading with longer lines, and point to the number of
characters as the variable responsible for the differences, rather than physical line length (visual angle).&#34;The OP thinks that humans read thinner columns faster. Generally, this seems not to be the case, so maybe we should treat his main conclusion with some skepticism. In any case, it&#39;s probably best to refer to the scientific literature."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Thinner columns allow for more of a &#34;Z&#34; pattern of reading, where you can kind of scan-read backwards when your eye scans back to the left, as opposed to the standard &#34;E&#34; style of reading of reading an entire line, returning to the left, then moving to the next and repeating.Writing in thin columns allows you to keep an eye on what you just wrote more easily as well."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"A vast majority on book typography agrees on 66 characters per line in one-column layouts and 45 characters per line in multi-column layouts as being the optimal numbers for reading. The text-block should also be placed assymetrically on the page, with the margins in size order being inner&lt;top&lt;outer&lt;bottom. The line height should be set at 120% of the highest character hight for normal book typefaces, but should be increased for typewriter typefaces and can be decreased slightly with shorter lines. A small set of typefaces are economic without losing readability, and if you use them you can increase these numbers slightly. But any more than 80 characters and anything less than 40 characters is suboptimal for texts that are longer than a paragraph or so.If you adhere to these very simple principles, you will have avoided like 95% of the typographic choices that can make texts hard or slow to read."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The Hook with sites like Reddit, HN, etc is that they ARE addictive. Actually addictive in the sense of gambling. In gambling addiction the gamblers aren&#39;t addicted to winning, they are addicted to losing, or &#34;almost winning&#34;. Now if they never ever won the addiction wouldn&#39;t form. If they ALWAYS won the addiction also wouldn&#39;t form.The old thing was email that people were addicted to checking because you MIGHT get an interesting email. It&#39;s the same way with training a dog. You don&#39;t always give them a treat for behavior. If you only randomly give them a treat they are more likely to perform the behavior because they don&#39;t want to miss the reward. If they know they will get the reward then they know the exact opportunity cost and can weigh that against performing the behavior.That&#39;s how social media and more specifically sites like reddit and HN are addictive.I think we all feel that we occasionally get some beneficial information from them. I know I do, and even this very post I feel has some benefit. But we also see it as time wasting because the majority of the time, that&#39;s what it is.But we are compelled to continually check because of the fear of missing out on some piece of beneficial information. If we were always presented with good information then we could more easily delay checking the sites."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"If you have such a hard time not reading reddit or hackernews maybe the correct conclusion is not that you&#39;re &#39;wasting&#39; time but that there&#39;s something enjoyable about so called low quality or idle activities and that they&#39;re normal part of a healthy life.I think it&#39;s deeply ironic that people will judge videogames on that basis but then to proceed to gamify and min-max their entire life because of this rat race mentality. If you think that kind of stuff is meaningless when it turns up as a hobby the correct conclusion is probably to not structure your entire personality that way.Just be less judgmental with yourself. things don&#39;t need to be highbrow or particularly meaningful to be a good use of time. It&#39;s mostly just a cultural artifact of our time that puts ripped busybodies and entrepreneurs, and celebs and intellectuals on pedestals."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Facing a very similar issue and trying similar things unsuccessfully, I&#39;ve found out lately with my coach that a more promising way to break out of the cycle of &#34;wasting time&#34; and beating myself up over it might be very counter-intuitive: Self-acceptance.I&#39;ve found that acknowledging my need for relaxation and satisfying my curiosity was a solid first step in helping cure my addiction on a more fundamental level.Changing my own internal reaction to realizing I spent the last 30 minutes on Reddit from self-punishment to &#34;Oh, interesting. Looks like I needed a bit of a pressure vent from the complex work I&#39;m doing. I&#39;m worth that. Is there anything even better I could do to myself so I can relax more effectively with quality time off?&#34; at least to me was a way better way to deal with it.I wouldn&#39;t say I&#39;m &#34;cured&#34;, but I spend way less time with these things, more time I would define qualitatively highly (like playing some piano, walking or just dozing a few minutes).Stopping the internal conflict from the other end might be worth a try for you too, even if it sounds weird."</p>

What about the typographic spacing characters?You should better be very afraid of using spaces in filenames.You should do everything you can to support them but you have to know you&#39;ll invariably encounter countless cases where you&#39;ll have this or that tool that won&#39;t work properly with them.I still live in a world where I cannot name a song from the french group L&#39;impératrice with an eacute in the filename or my car&#39;s media system will display garbage (it&#39;s running QNX and I don&#39;t know which filesystem).FWIW, and it should be food for thought, every single Git repository in the world contains a pre-commit hook sample (disabled by default but it&#39;s there) that enforces that every committed file in the repo is named using a subset of ASCII characters.Every Git repository in the world has that example: let that sink in."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I have recently joined a team that had invested in Svelte. I had previous experience in Angular and React. I was happy with React, but I decided to drink the koolaid and go all-in and do my best with Svelte.6 months later, we&#39;re moving to React. It is partly because our Svelte code was messy enough to warrant a rewrite, and partly because we wanted to leverage the React ecosystem in that rewrite. It was also partly because I just don&#39;t like Svelte very much.I think Svelte is clever, and interesting, and I&#39;m glad it exists. But I found a few points insurmountable:- Too much magic. The abstraction leaks and when it does, it requires a good mental model of Svelte&#39;s magic. I noticed this threw our juniors off.- Special syntax for reactivity is not javascript- I find the javascript-native flexibility of JSX far more expressive than any custom templating- There are major tradeoffs made by doing things at compile time. Things that are easy in React at runtime turn out to be surprisingly difficult in Svelte- Two-way data binding is a constant source of bugs- Svelte practically requires let-style variable rebinding, often at a file wide scope, which again caused our juniors in particular to write bad code- The style system is too opinionated for me. I also find it necessary to break into the global scope for any minor restyling of a subcomponent (or worse, pass in the style as a prop)- Built in reactive store is cool, but our developers all ended up using it for tight coupling and global variables- The strict one component per file approach can be cumbersome. It&#39;s not possible to write a one-line function component or similar- Much smaller ecosystem than React, requiring much more to be done in house (exacerbated by all of the above).- The faster runtime speed in no way made up for any of the above. Bad Svelte code is still slow compared to good React code."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Wow, this should be great news for Svelte and SvelteKit! Hopefully with Vercel&#39;s backing these projects will fly off.Having worked with React for about 5 years (with a project in Vue in-between) and now having dabbled with Svelte, there is just something more appealing working with less higher-level abstractions. Sure with large apps React does have its benefits and its ecosystem is larger by a good amount.But there is just something about being less annoying that to me is perhaps one of the most important things with any tool. If I enjoy using it, I don&#39;t mind that it may not be the &#34;current best choice&#34; of the moment. People who enjoy MobX especially I think ought to find Svelte quite nice.Sure though would wish SvelteKit was at the same level with Next.js. Fixing dev server errors is a little distracting at times."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This seems like a huge positive step forward for Svelte and the community. Big congrats to Rich!I&#39;ve been excited about Svelte for a while and recently chose to use it as the UI for a cross-platform video editing app (https://getrecut.com), with the back end in Rust. I&#39;ve found it a pleasure to work with -- Svelte Stores and the Context system are especially great for sharing state, and the app feels snappy. Last few weeks most of the focus has been on the Rust backend but I&#39;m really looking forward to building out more of the UI soon.I&#39;ve also been happy to find that its generated code is pretty readable. On one little performance-tuning side quest, I was profiling to figure out why the app was performing a Layout on every video frame, and I was able to step through the compiled Svelte component code and narrow it down to one of my own functions. I also briefly went down a path of trying to manually set the text content on an element, to see if it&#39;d be faster than letting Svelte do it. Turned out the answer was no, but it was nice to know that level of control is available if I need it some day.Excited to see where the Svelte community goes from here!"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"There is something very fulfilling (at least to me) about working this way. Not solving the problem in the best way, but solving it in the way you can _right now_. When I was younger this was how I solved most problems, but in my professional life I can&#39;t really do that (and for mostly good reasons).I follow someone on YouTube who moved to a small island in Panama, built his house, many boats, and lots of other items by hand using what he has. He is definitely crazy but he personifies this get it done attitude. A few years ago I travelled to Africa to volunteer at a hospital and was tasked with fixing an oxygen machine. I had to channel this YouTuber because there definitely was not the right tools and I definitely needed to get it done. I honestly surprised myself in how I was able to fix it and it was quite fulfilling."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This reminds me of an 80s tv show called MacGyver which impressed on me as a kid that you can use what you got to get out of tricky situations.  I&#39;ve done loads of different things as a result of this attitude.  The only time I stopped to think about the show&#39;s wider influence was when I was at University (some time ago) in the Engineering building with my best friend (an Engineering student) and a phone went off with the MacGyver theme.  When I told my friend I thought that was cool (these were the days when you had to pay for novelty ringtones) he casually remarked that a lot of the Engineering student body had the MacGyver ringtone and MacGyver had a huge influence on students enrolling for Engineering.After reading this article I wonder if there are MacGyver-esque influences on younger generations?  I haven&#39;t come across any YouTube channels or shows on Netflix, Prime or Disney Plus that would interest my 7 year old son and capture his imagination like MacGyver did for me as a kid.Having said that, in true MacGyver fashion I started teaching my son Chemistry last weekend using a whiteboard, YouTube and some Minecraft analogies."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"s/genius/resourceful and creative/gThat&#39;s not a slight. But being resourceful (and creative, of course) is what was displayed. There was no evidence of genius. Being resourceful and creative means using what you have on hand to achieve a goal.For example, I wanted to make a gift for a friend who loves dinosaurs. I used old bicycle parts and various bits of metal I had left over from other projects and made her a 3 foot tall T-Rex. She loved it! Money spent = $0. Am I a genius? Probably not. Was I resourceful and creative? Definitely.Perhaps for people who don&#39;t have a &#34;hack the world!&#34; mindset, it does appear as genius I suppose."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&gt; Shares of developer Fantasia Holdings (1777.HK) plunged 50% on Wednesday after it said there was no guarantee it would be able to meet its other financial obligations following a missed payment of $205.7 million due on Oct. 4.Watch the US bond market closely. Today saw a sharp selloff on the 10-year maturity, a favorite &#34;asset&#34; of foreign governments and companies. When those organizations get into trouble, they sell treasuries to raise cash. &#34;Trouble&#34; often comes in the form of dollar-denominated debt which must be serviced in dollars.As the dollar rises, borrowers of dollar-denominated debt must raise more local currency to buy the dollars to service their loans. That puts further upward pressure on the dollar, distressing foreign usd-debtholders even more. It&#39;s called a &#34;short squeeze&#34;:https://www.lynalden.com/global-dollar-short-squeeze/The entire world (including the US federal government) has taken a short position on the US dollar by assuming obligations requiring them to pay later in dollars. Ask any Ape on WallStreetBets what happens to shorts during a short squeeze, and you&#39;ll get the same answer: they get rekt.The dollar spiked past a key technical level today.https://www.tradingview.com/chart/?symbol=DXYIn 2020, a similar dynamic took hold, with stocks, bonds, and gold falling in price as the dollar surged. We may not be there yet, but the scramble for dollars in China (and possibly all of Asia) is just starting."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Interesting about this is that Evergrande is defaulting only on foreign held debt.

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;d like to know more about the &#34;built for devs&#34; concept you are presenting to us. What does that mean to you?For me personally, I rarely perform site:github.com or site:stackoverflow.com searches in my browser&#39;s default search engine. I typically just enter a few keywords and try to make sense of what I find.When I personally think of a search engine built for devs, I think of one that parses queries differently from the natural language processing that seems to be all the rage these days. For instance, when I search &#34;?. C#&#34; I want to know what this operator actually is. Instead,  the algorithm omits the ?. and just returns the most generic results relating to C#. https://you.com/search?q=%3F.%20C%23&amp;fromSearchBar=true This is true even when I put the &#34;?.&#34; in quotes. One of the results is titled &#34;Null coalescing operator&#34; from Wikipedia, but this is actually misleading since ?. is actually the null-conditional operator. The information is there but it is not easy to find.The other item on my wishlist for a dev-centric search engine is to be able to persist the main language(s) I am trying to search about. Its mildly tedious to type C3 and then my keywords (..... dammit, C#, this happens ALL the time), in each query to narrow things down and not get javascript results."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Google Maps may silently be Alphabet&#39;s most powerful property. As someone who has spent the last 8 months religiously degoogling my life, I&#39;ve found that Google Maps features are incredibly hard to replace, while at the same time, giving Google direct abilities to influence behavior in the physical world. People see it as &#34;just a map&#34;, but it&#39;s so much more. OSM-based map tools are pretty good as maps, but they utterly fail at being real-world information directories and functional tools for coordinating physical activities.I do have hope. It seems that there has been a lot of new enthusiasm for these tools lately, and some of them have key features in development.Two low hanging fruits: 1) location bookmarking features that can be synced between mobile/desktop with third party sync tools. 2) Link conversion features that can take Google Maps (or other map links) as input and open the location in OSM tools, and vice-versa.The real-world information directory is a much bigger challenge, but if the low hanging fruit features are developed enough that the average person could easily use open source / OSM tools for everything except a modern phone book, while still coordinating with peers who use Google Maps, then we&#39;d have a much better foundation for tackling the issue."</p>

I finally set up a label in my Gmail inbox called &#34;Already Unsubscribed!&#34;. Every time I unsubscribe to a newsletter, I add a Gmail filter that marks anything from that sender with the &#34;Already Unsubscribed&#34; label. This way I know if I&#39;m just misremembering unsubscribing, or if I&#39;m actually being spammed.Incidentally, I just checked that label after about a year of doing this. As it turns out, there&#39;s only one company that&#39;s ever continued to email me after my unsubscribe request.

This was mostly an exploit back in the day, but clearly email clients love it because they doubled down on supporting it.Having a different from and reply-to is also built into the way email was designed. Both of these features are built into every email client and service.I thought this was going to be a complaint about their clearly hyperbolic messaging, but OP is really frustrated about some of the most basic features of email.

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Bummer. I often use like vs dislike ratios as a gauge on whether a video is worth watching. If I see a 3,000 up / 48 down video on a topic I&#39;m interested in there&#39;s a really good chance the video is great.I&#39;m a small time creator (~13.5k subs) and don&#39;t care at all about upvotes or downvotes being public. There&#39;s only been a handful of videos out of hundreds that received more downvotes than expected because the video was posted on a place out of my control and folks didn&#39;t like that. Almost always if a video naturally gets downvoted it&#39;s because you either released something bad or unrelated to what your channel normally expects."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is a damned shame. I use dislikes to gauge if a video is relevant to the topic at hand.For example, I like fixing stuff and use Youtube for unfamiliar items. Often videos with a high number of dislikes are Spam (usually a bot reading text from some website), Videos where the person handwaves through the steps, videos where the fix is improper, or videos where the creator spends more time monetizing than working through the problem."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"So just to make sure I&#39;m reading this correctly (this is not my area of speciality so bear with me):This is Apple-hosted MDM, yes?I took a brief spin through this world on a consulting project a few years ago and I found it SUPER weird that Apple didn&#39;t do this already.  You had to do this weird dance between Apple Business Manager and the MDM solution (we ended up with SimpleMDM but looked at a bunch).  I kept saying &#34;Am I missing something?  Why doesn&#39;t this service come directly from Apple?&#34; and everyone was as puzzled about this as I was.  So I guess they&#39;re finally closing the loop here."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Smart play to focus on businesses with fewer than 500 employees, as those are the most likely to grow in the next 3-7 years into larger accounts, and they don&#39;t have the 12-18mo sales cycle and shennanigans of an enterprise.It&#39;s a strategic departure from being a consumer luxury product company, and the shift to enterprise suggests they&#39;re out of ideas, but at the rate they&#39;re losing consumer growth I&#39;d say they&#39;ve still got another 150 years.
Leveraging the apple store as a service point is a huge deal, as it may compensate for the additional hardware premium their products cost.I&#39;ve worked in a large number of organizations as a consultant and the microsoft ecosystem is basically unusuable to me now. Between performance issues and thoughtless design, I switch back to my apple devices to do simple things and get real feedback from actions while I&#39;m waiting for the microsoft platform to respond. As a result, I manage client work on MSFT, and do real work on my mac. With Apple getting into this space, I can&#39;t see buying another microsoft product unless I actually hated the people I was hiring to use it.The essence of the apple experience is that by their products being designed to be responsive no matter what, you are always engaged and working on them for the feedback, whereas some MSFT error message means I&#39;m going to go do something else for 15-20m while I get past the gumption trap. Current one is having to reboot the machine to reset a VPN driver just to check client site email. MSFTs problem  isn&#39;t from lack of a solution, it&#39;s that the problem exists at all and as a user I am even aware of it.I have lots of issues with Apple&#39;s social decisions, and am switching out of their ecosystem because of it so I&#39;m not an uncritical fan, however, this announcement means they aren&#39;t just getting into enterprise, they&#39;re getting upstream of it and in 10-20 years they will have replaced a lot of it. They&#39;re dropping in on a macro trend wave that is how work itself is going to be different."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I wish they had a better MDM for kids... All I want to do is ensure that NextDNS is installed/forced and that they can&#39;t remove it.  Somehow, if you block store, block adding apps and block removing apps and hide the icons, kids still figure out how to remove the damn thing and the only thing you can do to block it is set a 1 minute time limit (why can&#39;t you set 0 minutes? wtf apple?) and hope they don&#39;t stay up until midnight to click through in 1 minute and slide the slider to off (or figure out how to get into settings/network/dns and disable - which why can&#39;t the limits limit that??)"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Listen guys, don&#39;t get me wrong. As someone with Ø in my name, and both Å and Ø in my address, don&#39;t get me started on poorly written systems which cannot handle unicode properly. I&#39;ve seen my name and address mangled in shipping forms, in airline tickets (every time) and even in my marriage-papers since I married abroad.I literally have personal reasons for getting everyone, and I mean everyone, on the unicode bandwagon.That said... Maybe it&#39;s because I&#39;m a child of the late 70s and early 80s and learned to program on computers which simply didn&#39;t have non-ASCII characters at all...But can&#39;t we all just sit down and admit that allowing non-ASCII characters in programming-language identifiers was a bad idea? Can&#39;t we in the next revision of EcmaScript (or Rust, or whatever) mandate ASCII-only identifiers when in strict mode or using modules or whatever? Having invisible characters represent executable code is not just a dumb a idea, it&#39;s so hazardous that you might call it borderline malicious.There has to be some way to undo this damage, without breaking compatibility with the code which is already out there, right?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"First thing I did when I first read the story was check my editor. I already had the &#34;Zero Width Characters locator&#34; plugin installed, but that covered less than a handful of specific space character type codes.Still, the result was good: Looks like IDEA editors like Webstorm show invisible characters with colored background and a warning.My test was from that first article and also now from this one copy the example code they contained or linked to from the browser into an open file.Screenshot: https://i.imgur.com/ColuRNB.png"</p>

There&#39;s a lot of space for companies wanted to manufacture their own MCUs, for instance, without relying on massive supply chains.I think this&#39;ll happen at some point, as silicon manufacturing hits final roadblocks and becomes increasingly commoditized, but it&#39;d be nice if it were sooner rather than later.(This would be nice for self-sufficient decentralized communities being able to produce their own microelectronics as well.)"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"A few things people seem to be missing in this thread:- This ruling doesn&#39;t allow for supplanting IAPs, as the it only prevents Apple from prohibiting external links to alternatives. So apps still aren&#39;t allowed to have in-app payment alternatives, they can have a link to something else, and AFAICT they can still mandate an IAP option should be present if the app has such a link, like they do with &#34;Sign in with Apple&#34;.- If that sounds familiar, that&#39;s because it is: this isn&#39;t too far off from the agreement Apple reached with the JFTC that allowed &#34;reader apps&#34; (think Netflix, Kindle, Spotify) to have a link to an external website to set up user accounts: https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2021/09/japan-fair-trade-comm...- This is extremely unlikely to hurt Apple&#39;s profit margins all that much, because the judge also rules that Apple was entitled to a licensing fee, which it could still claim for payments made outside Apple&#39;s IAP system. This point is probably why Apple is fighting the ruling, because with external links they might have to put a lot of effort into getting their cut, as opposed to what Google did with their payment alternatives - i.e. adding a &#34;service fee&#34; to in app transactions but allowing alternative payment services. (This might not apply to the exception carved out for &#34;reader apps&#34;)Essentially, nobody wins. Even in the best case scenario, Apple will probably keep a significant portion (but not all) of its cut, developers still have to pay through the nose and users will probably stick with Apple&#39;s IAP if the provider can&#39;t make a significant difference, and can&#39;t sideload apps that the App Store won&#39;t allow. Yay!"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Apple and Google transformed mobile into a poisonous experience. Apart from being constantly spied, you don&#39;t get to decide what you can do with your own device. You can&#39;t install software unless is approved by them and if it is, you have to also pay them.As a developer, if you target iOS and Android your app should not compete with their apps, you have to get it approved and you have to get them a 30% cut for nothing.Why can&#39;t installing software on mobiles work exactly like on desktop?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Wonder how someone could get this ruling applied to Google Play...In other news, I spent some time this month implementing monthly billing subscriptions.  Stripe was easy and I could rapidly test almost every scenario (cancellations, deferments, non payment,el etc).  Apple and Google?  Good luck, you basically have to test in production to figure out all the corner cases for your users.As a solo dev, being able to choose my payment processor would let me focus on delivering real features and value instead of app store toil."</p>

Apple and Google kept bragging about these numbers at their respective developer conferences/yearly refresh unveilings and therefore Microsoft was all too happy to accept any and all apps into the Windows Store at the time in an attempt to appear relevant.Times have changed, though, and you could argue that now many people would like less app clutter and easier discoverability of the apps they actually want. What end user is benefitting from all these carpetbagger apps squatting on Firefox&#39;s brand? I don&#39;t know what the policy or action looks like to clean this up without instituting heavy hand moderation of the Windows Store but I feel like something has to be done.

The problem is the scope - ie. are you trying to do what you said you&#39;ll do (miniature software to log urls), or are you adding 100s of requirements to the scope (gui, filters, privacy,...).We had a bunch of .xml files containing some data, and someone wanted a .csv file... sure, an hour max, and it&#39;s done. Fire up some perl, loop, xml-&gt;hash, take the data needed, print line by line, done... less than an hour.&#34;Hey, can you add just this and that, and separate folders for this and a total and rolling sum?&#34;...yeah sure... hour or two.&#34;and this and that?&#34;...sure, another hour...&#34;Can this be made for that department to use.. just add a simple gui&#34;...and we&#39;ve gone from an hour or two, to weeks or months of work.  Nobody wanted a gui application made for &#34;normal users&#34;, with all the checks and verifications and documentation and everything when you made a request... the scope was a simple one-off script, and that actually took an hour or two.

								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; A few students came to me asking if I had any ideas for a software project that they could work on outside of class.&gt; I explained an idea for a utility that I had been wanting: A desktop program that monitors my clipboard for URLs and logs them automatically.I think this person misunderstood the students, the student wanted a project to practice programming, not a project to practice project management. The programming parts of this would take 2-4 hours, it isn&#39;t a terribly hard thing to code. All the project management parts would take days or weeks or even months or years depending on how polished you want it to be.Giving them a project management project because in your mind project management is more important just to prove a point doesn&#39;t help them at all."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The whole notion of online proctoring seems pretty whack to me also: what world are we training and testing people to live in?  The real world has internet, you can search for stuff, you can work from home and take a break.I&#39;m not good at things because I&#39;m always able to magically materialize the right answer out of my mind inside an anechoic faraday chamber, I&#39;m good because I get the right answer in a reasonable amount of time using all the tools available to me (the internet, my brain, books, whatever).I get that there are a few professions where you&#39;re really going to need to know the right answer quickly without looking it up under high-pressure situations, and it seems like testing and certifying doctors and lawyers is important enough to society that we can arrange to proctor those tests in person (and still maintain covid safety, disability/poverty access, etc).  That level of extreme proctoring security seems pretty dumb for random exams WHERE school &lt;= undergrad.If you elaborately cheat your way through all online classes all the way through undergrad, that seems mostly bad for you"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Proctor-spyware is also famously biased:
https://library.auraria.edu/news/2021/why-online-test-procto...I opted out of using spyware in the university physics courses I taught last year, and caught my cheating students the old fashioned way. Proctor-spyware, like airport security, is more about theater than effectiveness. You aren&#39;t giving the USMLE or a Bar Exam, so you can take the time to write a good exam and evaluate it correctly."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"They also are terrible at how they treat your local machine. I had to use them for a course I was in. I was having issues connecting because they kept insisting I used some Flash based tool. Their proctor started going into various settings on my Mac, clicking rather carelessly and what seemed like at random then declared the platform was unsupported. I immediately said &#34;ok, so now your going to return my machine back to the state that it was in before you started messing around...&#34; They immediately dodged the question and ended the chat. It took 3 more attempts to even get the test started and like a week to find all the damage they did to my settings. Terrible company."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I&#39;ve always loved playing video games. From the moment I realized there were places called arcades with wonderful machines that ate your coins, I was hooked. Game and Watch? Nagged my mom for every single one. Nintendo Famicom? We had ALL the bootleg cartridges. Gameboy? Couldn&#39;t afford it so I burned with envy. Original Xbox? I have 4 of &#39;em stashed away somewhere. Playstation 1-5? Heck, yeah. Mobile? My husband bought our first iPad because we saw someone playing Angry Birds on it. PC? I&#39;m playing The Ascent with my whole family right now.More than playing video games, though, what I wanted to do as a kid was to MAKE games. I still remember punching in a borrowed Mario Bros cartridge for the first time, pressing START and having a freaking epiphany. How cool was it that someone MADE this?? To heck with being an astronaut, when I grew up, I was going to do THIS. I knew it with all the certainty of 8-year-old me. But you know how it goes: like most childhood dreams, I put this one on a shelf and gradually left it behind. I didn&#39;t become an astronaut either (in case you were wondering).What I did was drop out of university in my third year. And since then, I&#39;ve been a copywriter, graphic designer, business owner, immigrant, stay-at-home spouse, and for a long time, the stay-at-home parent. And it&#39;s been great.  Life with all its up-up-down-down-left-right-left-right-B-A&#39;s...it&#39;s all been wonderful.&#34;Hold up,&#34; you might say, if you&#39;re still reading this. &#34;Why are you telling us all this? Boring.&#34;Right. Let me get to it. I&#39;m 48 and if there&#39;s a lesson that has been inescapable these past two years is that we may not see tomorrow. So, I&#39;ve decided to focus on happiness in the here and now. Carpet diem, as my kid used to say when he was little. And you know one thing that has added to my happiness? Dusting off my dream, sitting my ass down and finally learning how to be a game developer. And happier still? I&#39;ve done this with my husband.So we&#39;ve published our first mobile game. It&#39;s called &#34;Slingshot Effect&#34; and it&#39;s available on App Store or on Google Play. It&#39;s an infinite jumper that&#39;s easy to just pick up and play. Perfect for commutes or if you&#39;re stuck in a waiting room somewhere. It&#39;s a paid app because we feel strongly that the level of monetization in the casual game space is just...ugh...it&#39;s bad.  Thanks for listening, I really appreciate it.TLDR:
When I was a kid, I wanted to make video games. And now that I&#39;m kind of old, my husband and I made one.App Store:

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Congrats! It&#39;s absolutely refreshing to dust off an old hobby and do something with it!I&#39;m only 28, but during the pandemic I decided to dust off my old electronics hobbies that fell by the wayside when the mobile app boom started.Middle school and early high school me thought I was going into robotics, but the iPhone came out the year I started high school. When the App Store came out the following year, the smartphone revolution started, and about a year later I went all in on mobile apps and gaming for the rest of high school and my college years. Contract iOS and Unity3D work got me through college.It&#39;s somewhat ironic, because I haven&#39;t written or worked on a single mobile app since I left college (nor have I owned an Apple device). I ended up taking all of the knowledge of embedded Linux systems I gained doing robotics and started doing esoteric high performance storage virtualization systems as the starting point of my career. Never saw that one coming.I hadn&#39;t really done any serious hobby electronics in nearly a decade, but I&#39;ve continued to lug all of the equipment around every time I move. So, I dusted off some old hardware and got hooked once again, only to find out that the AVR is old news and everyone is into ESP32 and ARM these days :)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"@bananabat, congrats on launching your game and on your beautiful write up here. It made me remember Randy Pausch‘a famous “Really Achieving Your Childhood Dreams”, better known as “The Last Lecture.” (https://youtu.be/ji5_MqicxSo). Like many others, I remember being deeply touched by it. It is ultimately being about a man reflecting on a life well lived and achieving some childhood dreams like this is part of it.It is wonderful that you have been able to do something you find worthy in and of its self and find fulfillment here. Thank you for sharing."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This is pretty interesting, because the effects of migrating from lz4 to zstd were:- Total storage usage reduced by ~21% (for our dataset, this is on the order of petabytes)- Average write operation duration decreased by 50% on our fullest machines- No observable query performance effectsIt seems like the better compression ratio and resulting reduced IO more than makes up for increased CPU compared to lz4. I wish they had mentioned the actual effect on CPU.Compare to the recent thread &#34;The LZ4 introduced in PostgreSQL 14 provides faster compression&#34; [0] where the loudest voices were saying that zstd would not work due to increased CPU.

								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is super good. Again, the point is not Europe in and of itself, but also India and China.The demand for power in India and China is outstripping everyone else. And it is still stuck using coal power. India and China do NOT have land (for renewables) commensurate with the population or energy demand.
Also one of the biggest sources of renewable hydro power is a  geopolitical flashpoint for India vs China (https://www.indiatoday.in/news-analysis/story/china-proposed...). Almost a hundred soldiers died in an India vs China battle recently around this area.Both India and China have unilaterally rejected COP26 restrictive measures from developed nations... simply because it is not possible to reduce the power demand coming from populations (the size of Europe) being lifted up from poverty.The only answer for the next 50 years is nuclear tech. And France is literally the only game in town right now. So let us pray, this happens sooner than later. You do NOT want coal from 2 BILLION people in the atmosphere."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Macron said &#34;We are going, for the first time in decades, to relaunch the construction of nuclear reactors in our country&#34;.
This is a blatant lie, as France launched a project and never ceased trying to build.  However it failed flat.The last delivered reactor was Civaux-2 (generation II), in 1999. See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civaux_Nuclear_Power_PlantThen in 2002 the project Flamanville-3 was launched (a generation III reactor, the &#34;EPR&#34;, first one of its kind), and the building phase started in 2007.  It is a major failure, not delivered, at least 11 years behind schedule, and will cost at least 19.1 billion euros (initial budget: 3.4 billions €).

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I think this book would be perfect for me - I have been using Emacs for quite a while, but never mastered elisp: I could never figure out how to structure things properly.Looking at the book landing page, I think I would have passed on it because the Table of Contents make it look a bit like the book is just covering specific tasks (about rearranging sentences) rather than general tasks, like using best practices for creating packages.It would be good to include the paragraph from your blog in the book landing page:    In the first chapter, it tells you basically how to find Elisp functions doing things you need.
    In the second, longest chapter, it walks you through writing a complete, useful package, showcasing lots of Elisp features and good practices.
    In the third, last chapter, it hints at a few more advanced techniques – functional programming, lexical scoping and regular expressions.

This made me a lot more excited about the contents!"</p>

No, the stims didn’t really do /that/ kind of wealth expansion.To me, this still looks like the bullwhip effect, which is expected to have an outsized effect on demand over at least a year or two.Buyers, who got used to “just in time” shipping, got spooked by shipping delays and shortages from their suppliers, because of supply demand imbalances during shutdowns, and as a response they all put in orders for 2 to 3 times the amount they usually buy from their suppliers with the intent of rebuilding domestic stock so they don’t miss out on sales.All of a sudden, aggregate demand explodes.Shocking."</p>

I suggest reading Paul Krugman and Claudia Sahm for dovish views, or Adam Ozimek for a more critical view. In particular, the idea that “inflation expectations” can perpetuate inflation via a self-fulfilling prophecy effect has been called into question lately: https://www.federalreserve.gov/econres/feds/files/2021062pap..."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;ll take this opportunity to mention one of my favorite apps: Paprika [0].It&#39;s a recipe app that can import from just about every recipe site/blog/etc and if it can&#39;t auto-import it then you can use the really easy tools to grab all the pertinent information. Once imported you can edit/scale/rate/tag/categorize/etc the recipe. Furthermore it has meal planning tools and a grocery list built in. I love the grocery list feature because you can easily click &#34;Add to Grocery List&#34; (of which you can have multiple if you want) and then just uncheck all the things you already have. It has a &#34;Pantry&#34; feature but I&#39;ve never used it, I assume it will auto-uncheck items you already have when you go to add them to the grocery list but I&#39;m not sure about that.It&#39;s great to import a recipe and then tweak it after making it and see what works/doesn&#39;t so you don&#39;t have to find the recipe again later and/or remember the changes you made to it.It&#39;s cross platform (Mac/iOS/Windows/Android) and running it on an older tablet in my kitchen is an awesome experience (timers built in, switch between multiple recipes easily, cross out ingredients after adding them, etc).I have no connection to the company, I just love the app. If I had 1 request it would be a way to share recipes with friends through some &#34;social&#34;/&#34;friend-ing&#34; concept in the app (not using a social network). You can share a &#34;.paprikarecipe&#34; file that includes everything about the recipe but passing around a file isn&#39;t always easy and Discord just cuts off extensions longer than like 12 characters which makes it harder.[0] https://www.paprikaapp.com/"</p>

What I do with something I paid for should concern only me as long as it&#39;s within my personal bounds (no redistribution, no profit, no business, etc.) Breaking DRM for personal use should not and cannot be illegal."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Some years ago, I wrote the code specification for our ebook conversions. I made a priority of specifying good semantic structure, employ ARIA tags where needed, etc. I work for a university and there was yet no mandate for it, but it seemed only a matter of time. In the long run being a little ahead of the curve aid paid off, but now I need to go through and revise things to account for changing standards, and my own improved (I hope) understanding of what&#39;s needed.I&#39;m also reminded of an incident years ago when I was working in a New York, and an agent (for a popular, well-paid writer) called our contract department from my desk phone to insist they remove the clause allowing the LOC to make audiobooks for the blind. As agent crimes go, it might not be the worst, but it always struck me for how egregiously petty it was."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I run forums, I write forum software, I am pro forums.However I&#39;d also add that it&#39;s important how to engage with a forum.My top tips:1. Financially fund a forum, but have the enthusiasts run it so it is arms length but official. If you run it, spin it up as a distinct thing so that future independence is possible and easy.2. Bless it fully, point everything you have at it and have your support staff answer questions, and allow your engineers to go deep on details where they can. Transparency wins, if you can&#39;t do it don&#39;t run a forum.3. Have someone else run it... That was #1, but it means &#34;Don&#39;t moderate away dissenting voices&#34;. You will never have a more vocal and clear line of feedback to help you improve, you might not like it... your job is to either listen and learn, or to explain why you are where you are and not going to do something, etc. People aren&#39;t dumb, &#34;for money&#34; is a fine argument, but don&#39;t use moderation to silence feedback you don&#39;t like.4. Forums are great for content that ages well, know your audience... it&#39;s not only the person you&#39;re replying to, it&#39;s the 1,000 visitors who will never create an account but found this issue via a search engine.5. Don&#39;t use moderation to silence feedback you don&#39;t like! (Also #1 and #3). Don&#39;t even use threats of &#34;we&#39;re withdrawing support&#34; or &#34;unblessing&#34;... these are your users and customers, listen to them rather than fight against them."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Oh please do.  This seems like the perfect time to bring this up:I had a piece of software that used Discord for support.  They required that users be verified, which requires you to give you phone number to Discord.  I gave them my Google Voice number, which is the only number I have, and they rejected it because they don&#39;t support VOIP numbers.  I asked them if there was any other way to verify my identity.They told me, &#34;Just use a friend&#39;s phone to verify.  As long as they don&#39;t try to verify on Discord in six months it should be fine, we won&#39;t check again&#34;.Their official answer to identity verification was to impersonate someone else!"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I just wish people would use a system that&#39;s integrated into where the code is. I don&#39;t want to have to register for a forum when GitHub has a perfectly good ticketing system (and now discussions), and yet I have to register at another place where my details can be leaked from because who knows the technical capability of this one single person who may or may not have done any security.If it&#39;s a company, please have the forum integrated into your software.I seriously do not want yet another login unless there is a good reason. It&#39;s ridiculous. I have nearly 700 logins in my password manager and I&#39;d say probably 500 of those items are websites I&#39;ve registered once to ask a question (quite often questions that go unanswered). Half of these forums do not even provide the capability to removing my account without contacting the admins, which is just an unnecessary hassle."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Bing image search has solved this problem.For each result you can see multiple pages that include the image. It also shows the resolution and file size of each version. I did a test search for &#34;bear&#34; and clicked on the first result. It showed 14 different pages containing the same image with different sizes and possibly slightly different crops. You can also select a subsection of the image to search for that.It makes Google image search feel like an old school internet tool. I know Bing isn&#39;t cool or popular, but their image search is undeniably superior.I don&#39;t think we need to blame Pinterest for having indexable content. This is a failing of Google image search for not showing alternate matches for the same image.Bing has it figured out. I can&#39;t tell if Google just doesn&#39;t care enough about image search to implement it, or if there&#39;s some obscure patent preventing them from doing so."</p>

Same story if somehow 1 license = 1 target. This is something that I don&#39;t think was explored enough in DD."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"To be fair, it is quite murky to what extent groups like Al-Haq are associated with the PFLP (which, with its history of aircraft hijackings and suicide bombings, is undoubtedly a terrorist group). There is plenty of purported evidence of financial and personnel links out there, and I really doubt HN is the right forum to decide either way (unless someone is an expert)."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"For me Hot Reload is the most important feature, which will very likely be a reason for me to move a bit from Python over to .NET, which I haven&#39;t touched for 10 years. Back then I really used it a lot (after moving away from OLE/DCOM/ActiveX), in C++, Managed C++, C# and IronPython (no GIL!). I absolutely loved it, but it was limited to the Microsoft ecosystem.Yesterday, while randomly googling for &#34;hot reload&#34; I got aware of the drama which went down around two weeks ago, when Microsoft decided to remove this feature from the release, even after including it in the previews.Here is a good summary https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_pzDjw9HQ"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; In .NET 6, in-memory single file apps have been enabled for Windows and macOS. In .NET 5, this deployment type was limited to Linux. You can now publish a single-file binary that is both deployed and launched as a single file, for all supported OSes. Single files apps no longer extract any core runtime assemblies to temporary directories.This is a great! Now I can publish statically linked executables and run it everywhere. I don&#39;t have to tolerate Golang and its quirks just to have cross-compilation and static binaries, even though they will be larger in size."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"So for context I looked at the papers behind the scenarios.- The heart rate sensing is done on a smart watch, not a phone, and needs data from the actual heart rate sensor every couple of days [1].- The breathing rate is determined from a phone put on the breast or the abdomen [2]. Not really a threat vector in that form.- The audio stuff is incredibly impressive [3], but it doesn&#39;t look like they can reconstruct text with meaningful reliability, it&#39;s more about identifying the person or at least the gender of the person on the other end of the line.The location and activity detection scenarios seem the most credible to me, but the for targeted attacks the audio reconstruction might also work. The other two don&#39;t really seem credible to me yet, but good to be aware of them.1: https://arxiv.org/pdf/1807.04667.pdf2: http://www.ijetch.org/vol8/900-M302.pdf3: https://arxiv.org/pdf/1907.05972.pdf"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt;Facebook reads the accelerometer all the time. Facebook actually shows a support prompt if a shake event is detected across the app. This could be one reason why Facebook reads accelerometer data.No. Shake gestures are handled at the OS level and you only get began/changed/ended callbacks. Raw accelerometer data requires the CoreMotion framework, and it’s a lower level API. They are definitely using it for something else.This is also confirmed by this:&gt;The prompt has an option to switch this feature off. However, switching it off doesn’t stop the app from reading the accelerometer."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; Now, if this social app is reading accelerometer data on your phone as well as the passenger’s phone, the app can easily figure out that both phones experience the same vibration pattern. ... Don’t be surprised if you receive a recommendation from the app to add this passenger as a friend.Overall I find the article interesting but this quote is borderline tinfoily. Given the amount of noise in the accelerometer data and signal s much closer to the sensor than the bus itself - such as body movements, it would be hardly precise. Moreover the cost of doing all that research and computation as well as data transfer would hardly pay off."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&gt; A futuristic dystopia. A place where the real world sucks. Where people consider talking to someone a chore. Connection, closeness, ambition are replaced by detachment and dogmatic slumber. Society is satisfied with shallow thoughts and the pursuit of artificially created stimuli in an imaginary world.Beautifully written top-notch orwellian poetry. Seriously inspiring.Also as someone who has only ever used social media as a low-level content creator (we used to be called deadbeat artists) I feel like this starts an important conversation about the new problems that develop when you stop consuming and start doing.In my experience over the last  decade there are fewer and fewer ways to find a community and any success as a creator of any kind without getting corralled into social media and furthermore getting corralled into being a daily active user / consumer as to not get shadow banned by any given app.Doing rather than consuming feels much healthier than doom scrolling, but theres a larger dialogue that has to happen about the problems with creating in the 21st century imho."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This may not be terribly popular, and its admittedly just conjecture, but I&#39;m of the opinion that its less about the quantity of social media, and more how one interacts with it and even more so consumes it.Some platforms are clearly more toxic than others, though I&#39;m increasingly of the opinion that they are all pretty toxic, just different flavors of &#34;world outlooks&#34; to choose from.I feel that those that actively participate (commenting, posting, responding, reacting) are more affected and more caught in the feedback loop. Those that more or less passively read these platforms, rarely interact, and largely work to keep &#34;perspective&#34; seem to have less of a tough time on it and allow it to impact their outlooks and moods less.Those that tend to interact more seem to get caught in a sort of feedback loop. measured/Nuanced/Moderate or considerate takes are generally frowned upon on most of the major platforms these days. Outrage and simplistic viewpoints reign supreme, and most will bury the rest, forcing even those with moderate stances to either &#34;consider a side&#34; when continuing or just outright not partake. And all of these seem to be, relatively speaking, vocal minorities.There are plenty of people that consume stuff and just dont have anything useful to say, or just dont have the energy to say it and defend it etc. Of course this seems to depend on the platform as well, for example I would never post this take on reddit....With that said, I go agree generally, that these are toxic and create unbalanced viewpoints and world views. As Dave Chappelle said, &#34;twitter isnt real&#34;, and to an effect that true. Twitter, reddit, youtube, facebook, dont necessarily pan out to the larger population&#39;s opinion as a whole, at least where its measured (such as in politics and polling)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Another day, another person telling you how to live your life...Sorry, but even though we know social media has its downsides, it also has advantages: keeping in touch with friends, socializing, a way to stay up to date with your community, new recipe ideas, exercise ideas, time management ideas, maybe even the occasional envy that someone&#39;s success triggers more ambition in you to succeed etc.It&#39;s a tool, like any other, and if used properly it can enhance your life.Don&#39;t want to dunk too hard on this article, because the points made in it are valid. But they can be achieved while you&#39;re still active on social media.For example, if used properly, you can get exposed to a lot of novel ideas in 2-minute bite sized clips. You can get motivated to hit any of the points mentioned in the blog.Saying that, of course the article was written to be a very one-sided view on the topic. Given that, it&#39;s obviously going to be shared on social media and garner even more attention / clicks / eyeballs. It&#39;s not ... irony per-se, but something close to it."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Can we create decentralized library (catalog) protocol, so it can&#39;t be taken down? I&#39;m thinking about libgen/sci-hub/whatcd(RIP), but entirely decentralized, protocol-based. We already have basically all necessary tools: BitTorrent/IPFS to distribute files, magnet links to link them, DHT to discover peers. We just need to combine them together in a smart way and maybe add some bits of missing functionality, like:- categorization and search;- voting for every entry;- maybe reputation system. Where peers regularly publishing good, high quality content get their &#39;karma&#39;[1] upvoted. So when downloading you can choose people with higher reputation. Or when building catalog of materials in certain area of interest, you can filter only peers with certain threshold karma.- incentive for peers to keep seeding whatever they downloaded at least until achieving certain ratio (say, 2:1). Maybe by rewarding with &#39;torrent tokens&#39; that you can spend on downloading, commenting etc.[2]- comments to every entry (published torrent). With means to combat spam, insults, irrelevant stuff etc. E.g. with voting system, where comments with, say, -3[3] votes become collapsed. Or/and with aforementioned &#39;tokens&#39; that you spend when comment.- personal blacklists to block people whose torrents/comments you don&#39;t want to see.Maybe I&#39;m reinventing the wheel here and something similar already exists, but for some reason not popular (since I never heard of it)? In that case we need to figure out why it didn&#39;t shoot and fix it to make it work.[1] Your ID will be a cryptographic key a la cryptocurrency wallet.[2] With rare but sought after torrents rewarding you with more tokens.[3] Personally adjustable."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Master Foo and the RecruiterA technical recruiter, having discovered that that the ways of Unix hackers were strange to him, sought an audience with Master Foo to learn more about the Way. Master Foo met the recruiter in the HR offices of a large firm.The recruiter said, “I have observed that Unix hackers scowl or become annoyed when I ask them how many years of experience they have in a new programming language. Why is this so?”Master Foo stood, and began to pace across the office floor. The recruiter was puzzled, and asked “What are you doing?”“I am learning to walk,” replied Master Foo.“I saw you walk through that door” the recruiter exclaimed, “and you are not stumbling over your own feet. Obviously you already know how to walk.”“Yes, but this floor is new to me.” replied Master Foo.Upon hearing this, the recruiter was enlightened.Source:  http://www.catb.org/~esr/writings/unix-koans/recruiter.html"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This isn&#39;t true at all. Its obvious for a senior/staff/principal engineer to claim that their skillset is infinitely transferrable to any job role that needs a staff level skillse, but its simply not true. There are tooling agnostic skills you learn (managing complexity, upleveling team members, how to actually be a technical leader and make improvements that a manager doesn&#39;t explicitly tell you to do) and there are tooling specific skills that you need in an organization (EX: dependency management in java, performance issues in certain DBs, the unwritten/not explicit API issues in different cloud platforms). If I am hiring for a staff engineer, I will be trying to get the combination of &#34;tooling agnostic&#34; staff engineering skills AND &#34;tooling specific&#34; staff engineering skills for my job opening because you don&#39;t end up paying more for an engineer that has a well matched &#34;tooling specific&#34; skillset, but they will be more productive. The net cost to me as an employer is simply time, I might need to source 3x the candidates to get a good fit, but its worth it."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I strongly disagree.A senior engineer that has always worked in the backend won&#39;t be able to be up to speed with a complex frontend app quickly and be as effective as a senior frontend.There&#39;s just too much to know about browsers and underlying tech and a myriad it things.Same for a senior frontend starting to work on a complex backend all with god knows how many interconnected technologies.Being able to go from JS to TS? Sure. Being able to go from JS to Rust + Docker + (all your backend stuff here) not so much."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Related to database indexes, but not the post:  a busted database index brought down ticket sales of the 2008 Olympics Games.This was the first time regular people could go buy tickets for events &amp; they had been lining up overnight at Bank of China locations through the country.  We were down for over a day before we called it off.  Apparently this led to minor upheaval at several locations in Beijing &amp; riot police were called in.We were pretty puzzled as we had an index and had load tested extensively.  We had Oracle support working directly with us &amp; couldn&#39;t figure out why queries had started to become table scans.The culprit? A point upgrade to DBD::Oracle (something like X.Y.3 to X.Y.4) introduced subtle but in character sets.  So the index required using a particular Unicode character set, and we were specifying it, but when it was translated into the actually query, it wasn&#39;t exactly the right one, so the DB assumed it couldn&#39;t use the index.  Then, when all the banks opened &amp; a large portion of very populous country tried to buy tickets at the same time, things just melted.Not a fun day."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Why exactly would it be so bad to just put a suitable index on the table containing strings? The time complexity of the resulting search would be the same, so I assume there will be some constant factor slowdowns. Is it that indices over string fields are stored inefficiently on disk? (If so, can that not be fixed in the db engine directly?) Or is this fine today but wasn&#39;t fine 15 years ago?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The ending is the most important part.&gt; Now, what do you suppose happened to that clueless programmer who didn&#39;t know anything about foreign key relationships?&gt; Well, that&#39;s easy. She just wrote this post for you. That&#39;s right, I was that clueless newbie who came up with a completely ridiculous abuse of a SQL database that was slow, bloated, and obviously wrong at a glance to anyone who had a clue.&gt; My point is: EVERYONE goes through this, particularly if operating in a vacuum with no mentorship, guidance, or reference points. Considering that we as an industry tend to chase off anyone who makes it to the age of 35, is it any surprise that we have a giant flock of people roaming around trying anything that&#39;ll work?"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I&#39;ve been having some sort of severe performance issue in one form or another since Mojave/Catalina or so with a 2017 MBP and a 2020 M1 Mac Mini.The symptoms is always generally poor performance after the system has been running a while (4h to a week, varies), usually with WindowServer using CPU cycles non-stop and UI that felt choppy across all programs.This seemed to happen frequently after &#34;opening many files&#34;, like doing some recompiling with Xcode for a few hours, or indexing a large volume with Spotlight. Rebooting helps temporarily.Today I realized that data read/written since boot was about 1TB in a few hours on a brand new OS install, and I traced this back to the com.apple.Safari.History process. Somehow having bookmarks and previously using Safari 15.x caused a huge amount of I/O that wouldn&#39;t stop - the solution was to remove all bookmarks and reading list items. Performance was immediately back to normal, no reboot needed.So just logging in with your iCloud id, you could be &#34;importing&#34; whatever performance problem you&#39;re having on a new install.I recommend you reboot and take a look at your disk I/O stats - maybe this will help someone!"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I have created a learning framework for myself to learn literally anything.
First of all It’s not going to be easy to get started learning something new because there are many holes in your mental model about the material and the aim of the learning is to fill those holes.
We’re living in an information era. You can drawn yourself in surfing the web/docs/articles if you are some kind of perfectionism to convince yourself that you’re learning. But that’s the trap. You should spend about 30-40% of your time learning the material and 60-70% of your time applying it and then under the process you’ll find: “Oh I don’t know how or what is X” then you go to learn about X specifically. This works best. In other words as you will be applying what you have learned so far you start “learning on demand”. In other words filling the individual holes. This loop will force you to learn the topic."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Overall a pretty good summary of how to teach yourself new skills. I personally went far too much into unguided learning early in my software journey. I took on personal projects that were far too ambitious and floundered with problems that would have been 10x easier if I&#39;d focused on grasping fundamentals.What&#39;s missing in this post is that it entirely focused in isolated learning, away from tutors and other forms of interpersonal teaching. Any approach to learning stuff &#34;quickly&#34; should take seriously Bloom&#39;s 2 Sigma Problem. [1]Partly offloading your learning problem onto an expert tutor trained in master learning has a good chance of vastly exceeding any learning approach a novice can adopt on their own. The internet has thus far failed to support this learning model, I think because it would be incredibly expensive for students.1. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloom%27s_2_sigma_problem"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I must say it&#39;s worth mentioning that as you build up a library of knowledge and experience in your mind, learning new things become more transitional than exploratory. Picture spoken languages for example. At first it&#39;s daunting and most languages have their quirks but overall after a few you find your marks easily.The effort becomes a memory concern where cheat sheets are how you transition or learn quickly into a new space.I&#39;m a polyglot in software development. I can work with most tech stack within 2-3 weeks and be efficient within 3-6 months, idiomatic within a year maximum. A big part of that is due to relatability between spaces. Every toilet has a flushing button and every kitchen has a sink and every language had a form of exposing positive or negative response.My advice is always throw yourself in and swim. Find whatever swimlane or swimming aid available and move forward.One caveat is learning spaces that are constantly shifting. For example, Swift. What a mess. Look up anything in that language and find 5 ways to do something, 3 expired, 1 manageable and 1 undocumented that works. It&#39;s sad but know that that&#39;s the outlier, not the average!"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"A couple years ago I had an experience with a spider that entirely changed my perspective on them and most insects, and now I make a conscious effort to help them as much as possible, instead of kill or even repel them.This particular spider kept running back and forth between my monitor and a window, and when it&#39;d get to my monitor, it would wave its front legs at me. If I moved to the left, it would run across to the left side of the monitor and waves it legs again. If I stood up and moved closer to it, it would run back to the window, turn around, and waves its legs at me. From watching YouTube too much, I was always under the impression that this was either a sign of aggression or a defensive stance.But after a few times of going back and forth like this, I realized there were approximately 50 baby spiders around a light by the window, which had been closed since the previous day. Normally this would be a nightmare for me (I&#39;ve always had a fear of spiders), but after a while, I had this crazy notion that the spider was trying to get me to open the window. So I did, and it immediately ran to the babies, wrapped a single strand of silk around the old webbing, and started dragging swaths of the babies&#39; webbing toward the window.I have no idea if the room was just dry and they needed some humidity, or if the food had been too scarce for too long. Whatever it was, that parent spider was in full blown panic mode, and managed to effectively communicate their problem to a human. I haven&#39;t killed any spiders or insects since (aside from a few particularly asshole-ish mosquitos), and actually keep small water dishes in my bathroom for two spiders who&#39;ve now lived with me for nearly a year. If any babies hatch inside and get close to me, I use my phone&#39;s flash to guide them back to a corner with a light on -- they are seemingly always drawn to the brightest light source.Spiders are incredible creatures, and I deeply regret not realizing that sooner."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"One of my school friends walked a different path from me and became a paramedic. He used to have to go to homes in &#34;socioeconomically challenged areas&#34; in order to revive people who had taken substances that they should not have taken - and also other things which were even less good. On one of these trips in a drug hell hole he saw a tank with a spider in it, and he realised that these people were likely mistreating it. So he asked if they wanted it and after a short conversation bought it off them for a nominal amount.So - he had a tarantula. I had never seen or met a thing like that and I was fascinated. It was very shy at first - it spent all day everyday hiding, possibly because of fear of drug addicts. But eventually it got a bit more confident. The thing was, it recognised and remembered individual humans. When it first met you or saw you it would hide. If you were calm and Kit (the paramedic) was calm with you it would come out and allow you to stroke it. This might take a few visits. But, once you had won it&#39;s confidence it would come right out and say hi as soon as you were in the room.I came to believe that it was self aware, and that it had a mental model that included social interactions and trust. It was just a belief, as it&#39;s really hard to see the anecdote and experience I have as data, but that&#39;s what interacting with it made me think. I thought it was as smart as a cat, or maybe even a dog."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I wish I could a 2-3 hour interview where I (or the candidate) showcase one of my projects and explain the architectural details and decisions in addition to showing any cool/hairy/insane code that got the job done. We can discuss those things and see how to improve them, or laugh at the crazy solutions.Honestly how many times do I need to rehearse these dumbass algos (blah blah blah, so I&#39;ll optimize for space with blah blah blah) okay already. I would much rather show you real world code that I&#39;ve built, or passion projects I spend my free time on. I want to bring me to your company/projects, so get to know what I&#39;m about holistically as an engineer. I think you can best understand that by looking at actual work done and judging whether or not the person is capable of contributing to your needs.Whenever we face challenges, we learn from them. At scale, we learn everyday. So just hire people who are passionate about facing challenges and learning from them. Not someone who can spend 8 hours a day like a college student playing leet code instead of building something useful. It really isn&#39;t that hard to memorize a dozen essential data structures and algorithms. But then what? So cringe."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Having unscripted conversations is one of the best way to be swayed by unconscious bias in interviews.Even though this advice sounds awesome, I will be cautious of putting it into practice without thinking through the bias problem.I do remember reading multiple research papers on this, but unable to find them at the moment. From anecdote - In the last company I worked in London, only one team (DevOps) did not follow scripted interviews. It was the least diverse team, not just in terms of representation, but in terms of diversity of thought. Most of it was comprised of &#34;tech-bros&#34;.Scripted interviews do not mean you ask through a basket of questions. It just means that you stay within the guardrails of a set of topics and you go through all the topics. With in a topic, you have fair amount of flexibility. For example  if you are hiring for a mid level Java programmer your topics may include - Java 8, Testing pyramid, Functional programming, type safety, developer safety(CI/CD/Rollbacks/Code reviews/Pair programming etc), some domain specific knowledge and so on."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Been on the hiring side for more than a decade. In addition to other advice in this thread, I would like to add -I treat the interview as my chance to help the candidate pass the interview. This bent of thought may seem subtle, but makes all the difference in meeting the candidate in their terrain, and seeing the world from their point of view.  Consequently, the case studies given explicitly state that if the candidate finds something else that intrigues them, I am happy to take that as a case study instead - gives them something to flaunt and for me to learn about.Some candidates are shy to open up, or just not comfortable conversing with strangers, or misread the power asymmetry in the interview and get anxious - I spend a fair bit of time just conversing human to human.For the really uncommunicative candidates, I make a slight of what they built (fake slight) and this gets the conversation going like a star. The good candidates exhibit a great amount of &#34;Builder&#39;s Pride&#34; and defend what they built.  They really good ones admit to the possibility that there were other better ways to have built, or explain to me the constraints under which they made the choices they did."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The future is not as dark as it seems because of the rat race of megacorps.You can use reduced versions of language models with extremely good results.I was involved in training the first-ever GPT2 for Bengali language, but with 117 million parameters.It took a month&#39;s effort (training + writing code + setup) and about $6k in TPU cost, but Google Cloud covered it.Anyway, it is surprisingly good. We fine-tuned the model for several downstream tasks and we were shocked when we saw the quality of generated text.I fine-tuned this model to write Bengali poems with a dataset of just about 2k poems and ran the training for 20 minutes in GPU instance of Colab Pro.I was really blown away by the quality.The main training was done in JAX, and it is much faster and seamless than PyTorch XLA, much better than TensorFlow in every way.So, my point is, although everyone is talking hundreds of billions of parameters and millions in training cost, you can still derive practical value from language models, and that too, at a low cost."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The GPT-3 family is still to expensive to use, too big to fit in memory on a single machine. Prices need to come down before large scale adoption or someone needs to invent the chip to hold it (cheaply).The most exciting part about it is showing us there is a path forward by scaling and prompting, but you can still do much better with a smaller model and a bit of training data (which can come from the expensive GPT-3 as well).What I expected from the next generation: multi-modality, larger context, using retrieval to augment input data with fresh information, tuned to solve thousands of tasks with supervised data so it can generalize on new tasks better, and some efficient way to keep it up to date and fine-tune it. On the data part - more data, more languages - a lot of work."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Neat to see more models getting closer, thought it appears only one so far has exceeded GPT-3&#39;s 175B parameters.That said, what I&#39;m really curious is how those other models stack up against GPT-3 in terms of performance -- does anyone know of any comparisons?"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I built games in the 90s. Graphics was obviously the hardest part.We thought about things in terms of how many instructions per pixel per frame we could afford to spend. Before the 90s it was hard to even update all pixels on a 320x200x8bit (i.e. mode 13h) display at 30 fps. So you had to do stuff like only redraw the part of the screen that moved. The led to games like donkey kong where there was a static world and only a few elements updated.In the 90s we got to the point where you had a pentium processor at 66 Mhz (woo!) At that point your 66Mhz / 320 (height) / 200 (width) / 30 (fps) gave you 34 clocks per pixel. 34 clocks was way more than needed for 2D bitblt (e.g. memcpy&#39;ing each line of a sprite) so we could beyond 2D mario-like games to 3D ones.With 34 clocks, you could write a texture mapper (in assembly) that was around 10-15 clocks per pixel (if memory serves) and have a few cycles left over for everything else. You also had to keep overdraw low (meaning, each part of the screen was only drawn once or maybe two times). With those techniques, you could make a game where the graphics were 3D and redrawn from scratch every frame.The other big challenge was that floating point was slow back then (and certain processors did or didn&#39;t have floating-point coprocessors, etc.) so we used a lot of fixed point math and approximations. The hard part was dividing, which is required for perspective calculations in a 3D game, but was super slow and not amenable to fixed-point techniques. A single divide per pixel would blow your entire clock budget! &#34;Perspective correct&#34; texture mappers were not common in the 90s, and games like Descent that relied on them used lots of approximations to make it fast enough."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I’ve created a 4k UHD video editor for Haiku OS (https://github.com/smallstepforman/Medo), it’s a C++17 native app, with over 30 OpenGL GLSL effect plugins and addons, multi threaded Actor model, over 10 user languages, and the entire package file fits on a 1.44Mb floppy disk with space to spare. If I was really concerned about space, I could probably replace all .png resources with WebP and save another 200kb.How is it so small? No external dependancies (uses stock Haiku packages), uses the standard C++ system API, and written by a developer that learned their trade on restrained systems from the 80’s. Look at the old Amiga stuff from that era."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Lower resolutions on smaller monitors. 256 colors at a time, no truecolor yet.Lower-res samples, if any.Lower framerate expectations - try playing Descent 2 on an emulated computer with similar specs to the lowest specs suggested on the box. Even one in the middle of the spec range probably didn&#39;t get a constant 60fps.More hand-tuned assembly (RCT was famously 99% assembly, according to Wikipedia; this was starting to be unusual but people who&#39;d been in the industry a while probably did at last one game in 100% assembly, and would have been pretty comfortable with hand-optimizing stuff as needed).Simpler worlds, with simpler AI. Victory conditions designed to be reached before the number of entities in the game overwhelmed the CPU completely.Simpler models. Most 3d games you play now probably have more polygons in your character&#39;s weapon than Descent would have in the entire level and all the active entities; they certainly have more polys in the overall character.I mean, really, three million tiles? That&#39;s insane by that day&#39;s standards, that&#39;s a bit more than 1700x1700 tiles, a quick search tells me the maximum map size in Roller Coaster Tycoon 3 was 256x256, and it&#39;s a fairly safe assumption that RCT1 was, at best, the same size, if not probably smaller. I can&#39;t find anything similar for Sim City 2000 but I would be surprised if it was much bigger."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"In 2018 I built a privacy-friendly open-source consent manager (https://github.com/kiprotect/klaro) which is used on many websites across Europe. From the beginning I never liked the IAB, didn&#39;t implement it and told people that I regard it as unlawful since e.g. a user cannot possibly make an informed decision that involves thousands of third-parties. Still many of our users kept asking me about it since it was &#34;the way&#34; to become compliant.So I finally asked the IAB how one could potentially implement their framework as an open-source framework. Their answer was basically that it&#39;s not possible. You have to register as a CMP provider and ensure that your users are using your software in their compliant (ha ha) way, which is of course impossible to enforce with an open-source software that everyone can self-host. In general, in my opinion the IAB is mostly a framework to shift liability from the advertisers who steal the users&#39; data to the publishers and CMP providers. Therefore I&#39;m quite happy we never got around to implement this &#34;feature&#34; in our CMP, and I hope the IAB will quickly die and takes all those alibi CMP providers down with them."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I really hope they actually issue a hefty fine here, instead of just a &#34;now stop doing that&#34;.Not issuing a fine would send a signal that simply ignoring the law until you&#39;re told to follow it pays off, since the companies involved certainly made much more profit in that time than they would have made had they followed the law.Also, the fines should be issued to everyone involved in this mess - middlemen and library providers like IAB, the ad companies actually collecting the data, and most importantly the publishers that sent their visitor&#39;s data to them."</p>

Imagine Among Us, DarkRP (on Garry&#39;s Mod) or NoPixel (on GTA V) but with much more content for both antagonists and normal workers. Or Dwarf Fortress/RimWorld but everybody controls a different person (with usual crew count being 50-150 people).It has a great number of forks, with more than a dozen focused on the space station gameplay loop and various others that adapt the game to themes such as marines vs xenomorphs missions, an open-world modern day city setting, ancient civilization world, etc.Other than that if you want to find out more I&#39;d suggest watching the two most popular game reviews about it I added in another comment https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=29109264"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I don’t agree with this perspective: why do entry-level students have to understand the internals behind compiling their code, and weird edge-cases like misspelling import? In my experience this is actually the stuff that hinders learning and confuses students.The author claims that students won’t be able to do real-world programming without learning this esoteric stuff, but actually this is the exact stuff they don’t need to know: full teams can and have built huge java projects just by using the intellij project wizard and maybe a tiny bit of Gradle from stack overflow. Actually students can solve most of the author’s problems by spending 5 seconds on Stack Overflow.I’m not saying that these more esoteric details are completely useless. Learning e.g. the difference between char and UTF8 “character” is actually pretty important so that emoji inputs don’t crash your website. But this is stuff that should come in later classes, particularly for students who are interested in those details. Not everyone needs to know it.In fact my experience is that some colleges have the exact opposite problem: they teach students old tools and techniques which are tedious and not actually used much later on. Like writing code by hand and deducting points for syntax errors, or using some outdated framework e.g. jQuery. When I saw the title my first thought was literally “yeah stop making students use eclipse, they should be using IntelliJ!”"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; Using Java or Python in a professional IDE like IntelliJ IDEA, NetBeans, PyCharm, or Eclipse is not a good first introduction to programming for computer science students, whether they’re in the field to become web developers, systems software engineers, or academic computer science researchers.I was forced to program Java without an IDE and my experience is that I learned less in all those lessons over a year than in a few select days at work during my first year.Furthermore, according to a friend who is a specialist teacher this is a common problem:Most kids are inclined to see how things works as a whole while most teachers want to teach analytically by tearing everything apart.I&#39;m grown-up now and don&#39;t mind diving deep into stuff (in fact I enjoy it) but in my understanding we really should try to go with the flow when teaching:Teach kids the wonders of programming (and everything else) and then go into the details as needed.Because, if my friend is right and I understood him right (he doesn&#39;t teach programming) most kids doesn&#39;t want to learn programming because they want to know how to please javac but because they want to create cool stuff."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Eclipse is poor tooling for teaching. Far too many buttons and noise that gets in the way. But the opposite, programming with no debugger and no linter is just as bad. It punishes you for getting the smallest syntax mistakes by waiting for the compiler and reading out erroneous messages.A debugger makes it far better to understand the execution of code line by line, and should be standard in education, but it&#39;s not.I feel that visual studio code, with some modifications, would be perfect to begin with. Then when building things at a higher level, introduce why to use eclipse, like how it handles packages, etc."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Early in my career I got a Monday morning meeting invite on a Friday afternoon just after I left the office. The meeting was called “The future of &lt;business unit I was in&gt;“Entire weekend was a write off. I was so anxious.  And yep. They shut down the unit (but I got to keep my job).As a result this is forefront in my mind as a manager. One thing that works great is whenever I ask questions about something, anything, I also say “this is on my mind because…” and I find that both calms people and gets me more useful information. Context matters so much."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; When you’re communicating with your team, lead with context and reassurance. Never message someone on your team, “let’s talk when you get a minute”. That’s void of information and scary as heck!This should be engraved on a plaque in every office building."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The way I see it, if &#34;let&#39;s talk when you get a minute&#34; comes across as spooky that means you already have a communication breakdown and mistrust has already blossomed. Here&#39;s a slightly different scenario: You have a disagreement with management; there are many subsequent conversations happening behind the scenes; but no one keeps you in the loop or updates you on what is being decided. In that situation, practically any message (apart from &#34;here is exactly what we are thinking..&#34;) comes across as spooky, and you will start reading into what _isnt_ said.
In short, if you think someone might want to know something, and they have a reasonable claim on deserving to know, let them know. Keep people informed, and if you do that then &#34;let&#39;s talk when you get a minute&#34; won&#39;t feel like such a lurking shadow."</p>

Since these operations are happening between the SIM and the baseband processor, they are probably completely undetectable from the application processor and its Android/iOS/whatever software.&gt; I hope this is the start of a much larger exploration of proactive SIMs from around the world."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&#34; The point here is that the cellphone literally has a mind of its own, in fact multiple “minds”, including in the SIM. These various minds might not even be talking to each other, and just because a phone did something, that doesn’t mean that user caused it.&#34;Yes, baseband, modem f/w and the operating system work together but don&#39;t have to talk to one another.A great read about be REX, from Qualcomm that goes into more detials - https://fahrplan.events.ccc.de/congress/2011/Fahrplan/attach...All the fun Qualcomm PDF&#39;s seem to be missing from the net now, but there were more official/confidental PDF&#39;s that went into details besides this: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/REX_OSBUt even reading from the old dead CDMA2000/eVDO standard you can see more of this too - https://ftp.unpad.ac.id/orari/library/library-ref-eng/ref-en...And more on &#34;what is a qualcomm chipset&#34; https://ftp.unpad.ac.id/orari/library/library-ref-eng/ref-en...Yes, these links are not for GSM, but Qualcomm makes GSM and these carry over as a standard, and these 10-15yr old slides are amazing and should be archived too - they used to be public even on Qualcomm sites too.But thank you for the https://yatebts.com/ link - that is so cool, what I do with diagnostic and fun tinkering is with Qualcomm Tools that I no longer have access too. QPST, QXDM, etc."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Whenever I think the Internet protocol stack is too complex, I take a glance through the (also freely available) 3GPP specifications to refresh my perspective. They are so thick and dense it&#39;s a miracle that everything works, and I remind myself that people came up with all of it and there are probably experts who know far more than I ever will about that area. Nonetheless, I&#39;m not surprised that they are full of little-known features like this."</p>

You can use tools to convert it to plain text and grep through, or anything else you want.That being said, it&#39;s not perfect, but still pretty awesome.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Nuclear is one of a number of alternatives that needs to be seriously considered but due to the long timelines and high costs of nuclear it is also one of the best stalling tactics for the fossil fuel industry seeking to extend the life of their assets. Possible increased adoption of nuclear in the future is not a reason to avoid setting sunset dates for emitting technologies now and commence transition to whatever low emission technologies are the most available and affordable right now."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;d be fine with more nuclear power plants, but if wind/solar plus batteries are cheaper, that&#39;s what&#39;s going to get built.Also, renewables don&#39;t require a high degree of trust in the human operators to manage risks appropriately.  I think that&#39;s really the main sticking point with nuclear; reliable reactors can be made, but how do you manage the humans who maintain the plants in a way that&#39;s not susceptible to corruption or corner-cutting?If nuclear can be made to handle more of our energy needs for a reasonable cost, then that&#39;s a good thing, and if it can be made cheaper by updating regulations without sacrificing safety, then I think that would be awesome.  But I think we should plan for the future under the assumption that most of our energy will come from renewables.  That&#39;s the lowest-risk plan that doesn&#39;t require major regulatory changes or new technology.  (Apparently there are also some major lithium iron phosphate patents that are expired or expiring soon, which should open up cheap battery manufacturing to companies outside of China.)"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&#34;Sadly, in this room too, a part of the archaeological heritage has been lost due to tunnels dug by grave robbers who, throughout the villa, have caused a total amount of damage estimated at almost 2 million euros.&#34;I&#39;m curious what that means. How do you &#34;value&#34; something like Pompeii?  Are they just saying that they stole gold and silver worth that much, or that the damage to the ruins costs that much more to repair/recover?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The room was lit by a small upper window, and shows no evidence of having had any wall decorations.So even slaves at Pompeii had a window to get light from, we see."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Slaves and slavery were extremely different in Pompeii and Herculaneum then what we usually think of as chattel slavery as the default and only slavery that ever existed. An interviewee either doesn’t understand this or made very sweeping claims.
 &gt; “This is a window into the precarious reality of people who seldom appear in historical sources that were written almost exclusively by men belonging to the elite, and who as a result risk remaining invisible in the great historical accounts,” -
Many slaves were captured and famous intellectuals (Aesop is a famous example) or educated and used as tutors, they were not as modernists assume to be universally ill treated and abused. Slaves in Herculaneum were able to become free and it was a very racially diverse place where being a former slave of different racial background did not mean you were unable to have social mobility, many of the wealthy people of Herculaneum were indeed former slaves. Slavery was not a permanent state of being and the very elite the quoted author complains about often did write about slaves at least in name; the former slaves would take the last name of the old master and records were excellent."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&#34;When your company won&#39;t be the first to market, because about 20% of your total development capacity needs to spent on keeping up&#34;In the world of JS and Typescript this ratio looks more like 80%. I swear that node hipsters at my last job spent four out of five of their working days wrangling with dependencies or their transpilers, linters, packagers, bundlers and whatever the hell else needs to happen to actually make a node program run. Meanwhile the geezers that worked on Java services reliably pushed new versions of their code sprint after sprint, no heroics, no drama required. What the fuck happened to those &#34;modern stacks&#34; that babysitting them takes the vast majority of developers time? It&#39;s a nightmare."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I appreciate the contrarian point of view, and I don&#39;t want to pick on the author, but this sounds like words of wisdom from someone who doesn&#39;t have much real world experience.I worked in such a project who never upgraded once. And then Specter/Meltdown hit, and we had the mandate to patch all our systems (and the threat was very real). Welcome to a hellish mess of outdated deps that took weeks to sort out.But is not only me. I watched a talk from a Principal Engineer from Amazon builder tools, and one of their biggest mistakes was not to upgrade often enough, which made each upgrade more painful.So what do we do now working in multiple, large, multi-year projects?First, we set tools that tell us when deps are outdated, and alarm when vulnerabilities are found.Second, upgrading deps is part of the regular dev process. When you make a change, take the chance to upgrade the deps. Vulnerabilities are addressed proactively. The vast majority of times upgrades require no code changes.Third, we regularly upgrade deps of inactive packages.Lastly, if a dependency upgrade requires significant work, we create a ticket for it and address it as a new feature. In practice this happens very rarely, so it doesn&#39;t disrupt the development process much.As other&#39;s said, the key is to upgrade often, and then it wont be as painful."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Corollary: Do hard things more often, per Martin Fowler - https://martinfowler.com/bliki/FrequencyReducesDifficulty.ht...Upgrade everything all the time and it will never be hard. You&#39;ll have full context for breaking changes, and the diff from A to B is always smaller than from A to Q, and less likely to break in strange and confusing ways."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"My baby naming days are long in my past. I have two daughters of 14 and 12. Their names where a real challenge. My wife and I lost our first child. It would have been a boy. We had chosen for the name Roan. We where of course devastated. A part of me was also very sad for loosing the name. If the second would also be a boy we could no longer give it this beautiful name. We knew the second would become a girl and we wanted to include the name Roan in it. After really long puzzling we came to the name: Norah. It contains all letters or Roan and an added H. Something for her specifically. When we had our third we wanted to do this again. Norah was already at the daycare by then and played a lot with a child called Roos. Somehow we liked the combination but it did not contain all the letters or Roan. After some thinking we settled on Rosanne and we call her Roos (that&#39;s Rose in English). So her name does contain all the letters of Roan and extra.I like the idea but I am unable to have any more kidsCongrats one your pregnancy and I wish you the best of luck."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&gt; Pfizer’s phase 2/3 trial randomized non-hospitalized adult COVID-19 patients who were at high risk of progressing to severe illness to receive placebo or Paxlovid, a combination of the protease inhibitors  PF-07321332 and ritonavir. The efficacy analysis is based on 1,219 patients.One noteworthy feature is the newness of this drug:&gt; PF-07321332 was developed from scratch during the current pandemic. It’s a reversible covalent inhibitor that reacts with one of the main protease’s cysteine residues. Owen [director of medicinal chemistry at Pfizer] also discussed the chemistry involved in scaling up the compound. The first 7 mg of the compound were synthesized in late July 2020. Encouraged by the early biological data, the Pfizer team aimed to scale up the synthesis. By late October, they’d made 100 g of the compound. Just two weeks later, the chemists had scaled up the synthesis to more than 1 kg. Owen said 210 researchers had worked on the project.https://cen.acs.org/acs-news/acs-meeting-news/Pfizer-unveils...Less than two years from lab to clinic is highly unusual. If approved, I believe this would be the fastest lab-to-approval for a small molecule drug in the history of the FDA."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I think it’s hard to overstate what a big deal this is for science. This is a completely novel molecule that appears effective as an antiviral. This would a huge achievement for the field of drug design, and will hopefully lead to all kinds of great medicine."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I am thinking: if and when this is approved, we have to think about distribution.This drug is fantastically effective at preventing hospitalisation and death, if administered within three days of symptom onset.That gives quite a long time! But we still need to make it easy to take. Do pharmacies give it out? ER rooms? We don&#39;t want to wait until people are hospitalised; we are trying to avoid that.So when you test positive, does the government send you out a pill with the &#34;sorry, you have to isolate&#34; SMS?"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"One of the under appreciated legal precedents set a couple years ago was the Ohio V AmEx anti trust case. The case predicated against AmEx’s merchant contract forbidding merchants to steer customers away from using their Amex card. This was a common practice for many years, especially at restaurants since AmEx charged restaurants 6%.The Supreme Court ruled that amex was able to keep the anti-steering provision in merchant contracts because they defined credit cards as a two sided market, and the harm to customers couldn’t be proven. In essence, the Supreme Court set a precedent that in any 2 sided market, in order for something to be considered anti competitive, a high bar needed to be met: the government must show that both sides of a 2 sided market be harmed in order for something to be anti competitive.Had the ruling been the other way, almost every industry would have been impacted- Uber, App Stores, Advertising…etc are all 2 sided markets.In essence, Credit cards have had a huge impact to our lives this century for reasons that are not appreciated enough."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; It’s often forgotten, but prior to credit cards, many Main Street retailers like e.g. pharmacies maintained hundreds or thousands of credit accounts for customers individually, necessitating their own back offices, accounting, and collections headache.This article is a great history of how the modern credit card came into being https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/lifestyle/magazine/19..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; Debit cards are a very similar product with enough under-the-hood differences that they deserve their own moment in the sun. In particular, due to a quirk of U.S. interchange regulation, they basically fund most of the fintech industryBasically, the Durbin Amendment caps interchange on debit cards at a far, far lower rate than credit cards; they also have different networks (not MC or Visa) that can be run at least for in person transactions. However, the limit does not apply to banks with less than $10 billion in assets.This is why some online banks can offer lower fees and sometimes even debit cash back (1% is the most I&#39;ve seen though, so not competitive with credit). But its also why ever fintech under the sun pushes debit cards so heavily--the debit card is issued by a (small, non Durbin-covered) partner bank who then shares revenue with the fintech company.At the end of the day, credit cards are still significant better for customers. You can have multiple cards with different benefits while keeping all your money in one place, and you can prevent overdrafts because you don&#39;t have random subscriptions taking out unpredictable amounts of money in the middle of the night and causing a check to bounce the next day. You are no longer obsessing over &#34;early payday&#34; features or ACH speeds.Credit cards also provide a nice hack to allow cash deposit for those with only online banks--you can often use a big bank&#39;s ATM to make a payment towards the credit card, allowing you to get rid of ordinary amounts of cash."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Helion hasn&#39;t published the triple product results for their latest Trenta reactor, but for the previous Venti they achieved a triple product of ~10^19 keV.s/m^3 at an ion temperature of 2 keV. The Trenta reactor has achieved an ion temperature of 9 keV. For D-T fusion, you need a triple product of about 3x10^21 kev.s/m^3 at 10 keV. For the D-He reaction that helion intends to use, they need to achieve a similar triple product at 50 keV. So it looks like they&#39;re still 2-3 orders of magnitude off from where they need to be to achieve ignition. Their neutron production rate is comparable to industrial fusors at ~10^11 n/s, which while useful as neutron sources are nowhere near producing net power. Compare this with tokamaks that have achieved a triple product around 1.5x10^21 keV.s/m^3, or about half of what they need to achieve ignition.While it&#39;s possible that helion has made improvements to ion density and confinement allowing them to achieve a significantly higher triple product and close the gap to power production, I see no reason why a company looking for investment would hide such a result, especially while putting out press releases celebrating other milestones. I doubt they&#39;re anywhere near the point where an economical plant could even be considered, though I&#39;d love to be proven wrong."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is the type of investing one (at least me) dreams of doing if you&#39;re fortunate enough to get to $B+ in net worth. Sam knows enough people who knows how this tech works to get a read on quality / achievability, and if he gets it right (however challenging/unlikely), it means incredible things. If it doesn&#39;t work, whatever -- at least he&#39;s shooting at something interesting. And talk about something intellectually interesting to be involved with -- it must be a collection of great minds at this company."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The DoE is complicit in this as well (from the original article):&gt; In the letter to teachers, Education Commissioner Margie Vandeven said “an individual took the records of at least three educators, unencrypted the source code from the webpage, and viewed the social security number (SSN) of those specific educators.”&gt; But in the press release, DESE called the person who discovered the vulnerability a “hacker” and said that individual “took the records of at least three educators”This squares perfectly with my own experience. As a middle schooler I had several interactions with my school system&#39;s IT department where they baselessly accused me of hacking and malicious intent; I responsibly disclosed a method of bypassing their web content filter and they responded by going through my roaming profile and leveling charges at me of &#34;remotely hacking computer systems&#34; because of a screenshot of a terminal emulator they found. I was a good kid with a perfect disciplinary record. In retrospect it was a series of incompetent staffers covering for their inability by bullying a child.The US needs to stop using public facilities (schools, the military, etc) as white-collar welfare and hire more people that actually care. Ignorance is forgivable but when combined with a steadfast opposition to personal growth it becomes malicious. It&#39;d be better for society to fire clowns like these and administer them unemployment than to have them crowd out those that actually give a shit.*EDIT: To clarify for anybody that would read the above as &#34;government workers don&#39;t care&#34;: there are plenty that do. I break bread with them and want them to be able to do their jobs unimpeded by the ones that _don&#39;t_."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Previous thread from 3 weeks ago: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=28867562Recent developments:- The CS professor whose expert opinion was quoted by the newspaper article is demanding an apology and legal expenses from the state, alleging that the governor defamed and violated his free speech rights.- The governor&#39;s political fundraising committee is running ads making this a &#34;fake news&#34; issue.The email that the reporter sent, in advance of publishing the article revealing the state education website&#39;s data leakage:&gt; “I recently discovered a significant exposure of the sensitive data of more than 100,000 teachers on a DESE website,” Renaud wrote to the agency’s communications chief, Mallory McGowin. “At this point I am confident what I found is a genuine vulnerability — I have confirmed with three teachers from different districts that their data was exposed. I also have consulted an UMSL cybersecurity researcher who verified my findings. The P-D plans to publish a story about this sensitive data exposure, but we wanted to inform DESE first so that you would have a chance to mitigate the problem.”&gt; Renaud shared his timeline for publishing the story and asked for interviews with officials from DESE and the Missouri Office of Administration’s Information Technology Services Division. In a second email sent about 45 minutes later, he described the steps he’d taken in finding and confirming the vulnerability."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The governor&#39;s stance is just posture. &#34;We take these matters seriously&#34;.It reminds me of that time, a few years after I was out of college and into a job. My professor contacted me to demo my class project to her students. To give them an idea of what they can do with web development. Her assistant told me that they couldn&#39;t figure out how to run it.Of course, I took a day off from work, opened back up my school project, fixed the annoying bug. The web page required IIS to run so I could make Ajax requests. I decided to hardcode the data in json instead. So I went to school to present my project.The professor was double clicking the file and it wasn&#39;t displaying properly. I inserted my USB stick, and ran it from there instead. The coral reef restaurant website appeared on the big screen. I explained that I had to make some changes so it would work locally. Before, I was using a web server.&#34;Web server?&#34; she shouted. &#34;You are not allowed to use a web server. So you guys cheated!&#34;At first, I thought she was just kidding. I explained that Chapter 12 specifically asks to boot up IIS in order to make use of Ajax. During my time, the rest of the class stopped at chapter 10. I completed the entire book because I was just in love with learning JavaScript. So unless you get to chapter 12, you don&#39;t learn about Ajax.&#34;I&#39;ll have to report you. They board might revoke your grade. Not just you but all your group.&#34;You can only imagine how pale I became. But I understood what was happening. She had tried to run the project multiple times and failed. She couldn&#39;t debug it or figure out the issue. To save face in front of the class, she accused me of having cheated. This is the exact thing the Missourians officials are doing.No, at the end of the day my grades were not revokes. Plus I had dropped out of college and was working in the field for a few couple years already. But it goes to show you the length people would go just to save face."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I used to lead Sys Eng for a FTSE 100 company. Our data was valuable but only for a short amount of time. We were constantly scraped which cost us in hosting etc. We even seen competitors use our figures (good ones used it to offset their prices, bad ones just used it straight).
As the article suggest, we couldn&#39;t block mobile operator IPs,  some had over 100k customers behind them. Forcing the users to login did little as the scrapers just created accounts. 
We had a few approaches that minimised the scraping:Rate Limiting by login,Limiting data to know workflows
...But our most fruitful effort was when we removed limits and started giving &#34;bad&#34; data. By bad I mean alter the price up or down by a small percentage. This hit them in the pocket but again, wasn&#39;t a golden bullet. If the customer made a transaction on the altered figure we we informed them and took it at the correct price.It&#39;s a cool problem to tackle but it is just an arms race."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I scrap government sites a lot as they don&#39;t provide apis. For mobile proxies, I use the proxidize dongles and mobinet.io (free, with Android devices). As stated in the article, with cgNAT it&#39;s basically impossible to block them as in my case, half the country couldn&#39;t access the sites anymore (if you place them in several locations and use one carrier each there)."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"In a particularly hard to scrape website, using some kind of bot protection that I just couldn&#39;t reliably get working (if anybody wants to know what that was exactly, I&#39;ll go and check it) I now have a small Intel NUC running with firefox that listens to a local server and uses Temper Monkey to perform commands. Works like a charm and I can actualy see what it&#39;s doing and where it&#39;s going wrong. (though it&#39;s not scalable, of course)We use it for data-entry on a government website. A human would average around 10 minutes of clicking and typing, where the bot takes maybe 10 seconds. Last year we did 12000 entries. Good bot."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"It&#39;s somewhat refreshing that the underlying bug isn&#39;t from some C or C++ utility, but instead a Perl program using eval: https://github.com/exiftool/exiftool/blob/11.70/lib/Image/Ex... Another instance of &#34;avoid eval as much as possible&#34; for languages that have it."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I feel like this article could have been far more useful with the following points being explicitly mentioned, or at least summarized:  - the problem appeared in GitLab 11.9.0
  - the problem seems to have been fixed in GitLab 13.8.8
  - the vulnerability uses ExifTool, so to exploit it, a user needs to be able to upload images
  - if an update is not (yet) possible, DjVu format file uploads can be blocked to avert this vulnerability
  - this vulnerability isn&#39;t relevant for GitLab instances that just have 1 user, or are not publicly accessible on the Internet

Now, i&#39;m not saying that the above is entirely true, but after reading something like the above, one should be able to figure out how to best act:  - if you have a public GitLab instance with open registrations, consider updating it immediately (with backups in place, of course)
  - if you have a private GitLab instance with many users in your own corporate network (that somehow isn&#39;t updated yet) - this is a good reason to put updating it into your agenda today, even if your users aren&#39;t necessarily hostile
  - if you have a private GitLab instance or one with registrations closed (e.g. you&#39;re the only user or people that you trust use it), mark this down and update whenever possible, however it&#39;s probably not necessary right this moment

Of course, i can&#39;t say the above with 100% confidence, because the article itself lacks this actionable information to aid in decisionmaking and so i&#39;m left to piece things together on my own, because of which i could be wrong.On an unrelated note, DjVu is a pretty interesting file format, though sadly i&#39;ve only seen it be used very sparsely, on some Russian forums for tractor manuals or something: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DjVu"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&#34;..Bowling said he discovered a way to abuse how ExifTool handles uploads for DjVu file format used for scanned documents to gain control over the entire underlying GitLab web server&#34;Ah, the good old &#34;File upload vulnerability&#34;. File uploads remain one of the hardest problems to solve when it comes to security."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"It&#39;s encouraging seeing all the work going into making tagged unions a natural part of TS. I&#39;ve tried to introduce them multiple times, and have been shot down by my team on every attempt. I think they still come across as &#34;hacky,&#34; and more JS-minded people who are totally cool validating with if-else everywhere still can&#39;t appreciate the benefits of annotating data in this manner. I hope TS eventually arrives at a standard, low impact way to create and manipulate such structures; maybe more people will be on board then. It looks like we&#39;re moving in the right direction."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Very nice!The very, very related thing I found myself wishing I had just today is the ability to destructure discriminated union fields which only exist on one component type of the union.As an example, with the following type system:    type Output = OutputExists | OutputDoesntExist;
    interface OutputExists { exists: true, url: string };
    interface OutputDoesntExist { exists: false };

The ability to destructure like:    const f = ({ exists, url }: Output) =&gt; {}

Such that, at the time of destructuring:    exists: true | false
    url: string | undefined

I believe, with this PR, if we re-structured the types above to:    interface OutputDoesntExist { exists: false, url: undefined };

That destructuring would be possible, with all the control flow analysis necessary to make it useful. Today, even that wouldn&#39;t be possible, so definitely excited for this change.But, I&#39;m curious if anyone knows if this change can extend to situations where a field isn&#39;t even defined in one of the unions, and the compiler can just insert an undefined type for those fields. Or, maybe this would have some unresolveable side-effects I&#39;m not considering."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"One thing I&#39;m wondering: with all the bells and whistles and insanely complex things TS now supports, why does it still fail to catch seemingly simple mistakes?For instance, it&#39;s sooo easy to write a React component taking in another component as a prop and some props for that other component, to rendering it. But somehow lose the type safety of the props being passed in. Like, you write some generics and the compiler stops complaining inside your component. But if you go back out and then try to pass some weird props instead, it doesn&#39;t care. I feel it&#39;s too easy to write code that looks tyoe safe but subtly isn&#39;t."</p>
