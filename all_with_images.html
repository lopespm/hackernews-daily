								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Something similar happened to my dad (USAF fighter pilot) in around 1961 or 62: He was test-flying a T-33 single-engine jet trainer assigned to his unit after it&#39;d had repair work. The engine quit and wouldn&#39;t restart. He ejected, but his parachute didn&#39;t deploy fully (much the same as in the article) and he got tangled in the shrouds. He said a quick Hail Mary just before crashing head-first in a muddy, fresh-plowed field. The pilot of another plane in the area saw the crash and radioed the tower to send the meat wagon and not the ambulance, but my dad walked away with just a headache — and with his helmet split open like a melon. The impact apparently damaged his inner ear: five years later he started getting vertigo while aloft, and soon afterwards got medically grounded. (That meant he lost the extra flight pay and was reduced to his base pay, with four school-aged kids while stationed in the Washington DC area — to make ends meet, my mother had to go back to work as an RN [registered nurse].)EDIT: What I remember was that when my dad crashed (see above), my mom came to get me from playing with the neighbor kids in their yard. Dad had called her from the flight surgeon&#39;s office and told her about the crash (very nonchalantly, she later said), and that he was OK. So six-year-old me blithely went on playing. Of course, my mom had been living with that possibility all their married life ...."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"In a story of insane luck (and unluck!), the craziest part is definitely this&#34;  He said that if I had had a spleen, it almost certainly would have ruptured when I hit the water, and I would have bled to death. Of the 25 pilots in our squadron, I am the only one without a spleen. It gives me something to think about. Maybe it does you as well.&#34;"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This happened in 1963.  Planes had only been flying for 60 years at that point; it really is pretty amazing how quickly we progressed on technology during those early years.  We still fly 737s, which are descended from a design that first flew in 1967.  As well as the C130, which was part of this story.  And don&#39;t get me started on B-52s, which are even older.We have made great strides since then, of course, but it does feel like 90% of the fundamental aviation technology we have today was created just in the first few decades."</p>

As you&#39;re probably finding now, you will hit AWS limits quickly.You might instead want to have a smaller pool of (larger) servers that you run co-resident VMs on with https://firecracker-microvm.github.io/.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The IME gets a lot of hate around here, but let&#39;s not get distracted by it: higher-privilege co-processors running code outside the main OS&#39; control is becoming (or already is) the norm everywhere. Intel-based PCs are just one instance of it (and perhaps not even the most egregious one).Most hardware has evolved to effectively run the main OS under a sandbox where it &#34;thinks&#34; it is in control, but isn&#39;t.A nice talk on this: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=36myc8wQhLo"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Usually when I&#39;m reminded about IME (and whatever the equivalent is in AMD chips), it&#39;s in the context of some strong claims about it being &#34;game over&#34; for security and privacy against mass surveillance, engineered / funded by nation-state intelligence agencies, and rendering all other technical efforts moot. They make it sound plausible, and I think &#34;why isn&#39;t this talked about or investigated more?&#34; The section of the Wikipedia page that discusses the &#34;backdoor&#34; claim is frustratingly thin. I just don&#39;t know what to make of it. Hyperbole about a crappy thing, like the bloatware pre-installed on most new laptops and phones by the vendor? An open secret, with discussion about it suppressed?"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"As others have noted, they still have an education focused robotics set, it’s just not called Mindstorms:
https://www.lego.com/en-us/product/lego-education-spike-prim...As a now-successful robotics engineer, I was the target age when the first Lego mindstorms set came out. Due to the cost it had to be a combined birthday and Christmas present (still obviously very privileged). The simple scratch-like programming system that kit used was great for me as a tween learning robotics.Today I am designing an open source farming robot as a non profit project! (See my profile)The early history of Lego Mindstorms is interesting. I didn’t realize Seymour Papert was involved but that makes a lot of sense! Especially with the name Mindstorms:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lego_Mindstormshttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mindstorms_(book)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I got the original Lego Mindstorms 1.0 kit for my 8th birthday - there was no programming interface, just a way to select one of 256 possible sequences of high-level actions the robot would perform in a loop. I paid for my first car by working at summer camps that taught kids how to use the Mindstorms 2.0 and NXT, and built my first 3D printer with Lejos (https://lejos.sourceforge.io/), Lego Technic parts and a tiny spindle router that could sculpt shapes into floral foam.While I&#39;m saddened by this news for nostalgic reasons, I personally believe that today&#39;s young learners are better served by the proliferation of hobby robotics platforms like Arduino/Raspberry Pi. Every summer camp I worked at would claim that Lego robotics teaches real-world engineering skills, while in reality the students were just happy to stay within the comfort zone of playing with Legos and using a block-based programming environment (one that has quite frankly gone from bad to worse to absolutely horrible with each product cycle). Also, FIRST Lego League does nothing meaningful to prepare students for FIRST - when I donated supplies and a few weeks of mentorship to my former high school&#39;s FIRST team, I was dismayed to see how much dead weight the team was carrying in students who participated in the middle school Lego league, who did not have even the basic coding/engineering skills to make any contribution to the high school team other than paying the membership dues."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Sad to see this as someone who enjoyed these as a kid and entering robotics competitions based off of them; hopefully the new products will keep the spirit alive.There was even some decent FOSS tooling that developed on top of Mindstorms: I used NXC (Not eXactly C, https://bricxcc.sourceforge.net/nbc/welcome.html) which was a C-like language  for programming Lego Mindstorms. It looks like the last release of NXC was in 2011."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"A bit tangential but I just got a Tesla Model 3 and paid $6,000 extra for “enhanced autopilot” buying into all the marketing about it, and its one of the biggest regrets of my life and makes me unable to appreciate an otherwise great car. I just feel sick about it. The enhanced autopilot is buggy and doesn’t save me any effort. The summon and auto park don’t really work. I think it’s a scam.  Other than that it’s a great car."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"When people say they want career progression, and opportunities, what they mostly mean is they want more money. Unfortunately, most companies have fallen into the trap where if someone has a title of X they can only make up to Y, regardless of how good they are at their job or how long they&#39;ve done it. When that happens then the name of the game is getting a promotion in order to keep making more money. That creates a perverse incentive, and the result is political bullshit that is typically misaligned with the company&#39;s interests which further drives away your high performers.End the perverse incentives. Pay your people well if they&#39;re doing a good job, regardless of how long they&#39;ve been doing the same job or what their title is. Reward seniority and loyalty. Suddenly, you&#39;ll find that employee retention goes through the roof, and you don&#39;t have to worry about hiring new people all the time."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Too many times in my career have I seen an employer lose an employee, who has a ton of institutional knowledge and performs adequately or even excellently, only to replace them them with someone that ends up costing much more money, and then takes a lot of time to get up to speed (which also slows the folks who help get them up to speed).It is like they haven&#39;t taken the time to even make a rudimentary calculation on the costs involved in keeping the employee versus replacing them."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The hazard of retention is creating dependency. Dependency means, not just high bus factor, but opening yourself (the business) up to being vulnerable to another person&#39;s superior negotiation position. Then CEOs/boardmembers would have to spread their wealth rather than hoarding it all for themselves. Without a way to force CEO/boardmembers to spread their wealth (unions), I think we can expect companies to do what is in their best interest, maintaining a monopoly on power by ensuring no dependencies."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"When I used play soccer regularly, I&#39;d occasionally experience being &#34;in the zone&#34;. It&#39;s a blissful experience where my body is able to execute incredibly complex set of moves in perfect coordination as my mind enters a state of zen-like calm.The sensation is almost like a being spectator in my own body. My brain feels like it&#39;s been relieved of the task of managing the moment-to-moment decision. Instead I start noticing moves 3, 4 steps ahead as time slows to a crawl around me. I don&#39;t know if this type of experience is related in any way to the theory of consciousness, but it feels like the unconscious mind holds a lot of secrets that I&#39;d love to see unlocked in my lifetime."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"There&#39;s a rumored experiment called the &#34;precognitive carousel&#34;, supposedly run by Grey Walter, where:(1) Subjects are told to push a button to advance a slide projector carousel, but not told that the button is inert(2) The carousel advances based on electrical signals measured by wires on the subjects&#39; scalp.(3) Subjects supposedly report the uncanny feeling that the projector advances &#34;just before&#34; they were about to push the button -- 300-400 milliseconds before, a pretty long time.I read about this a long time ago in a since-deleted post on an old timey internet forum (everything2).The writer suggested this research supports the idea that your body chooses what to do, then informs your brain, and your consciousness convinces itself that has decided to do what the body is about to do on its own."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I realize that the link between consciousness and quantum effects are far from proven but if you will entertain the idea that they are...Delayed-choice experiments demonstrate the seeming ability of measurements in the present to alter events occurring in the past. eg. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delayed-choice_quantum_eraserNow I&#39;ll throw out another completely unprovable thought...Perhaps consciousness has the ability to affect how wavefunction collapse occurs, perhaps it even has the ability to influence the observed outcome.I&#39;m not going to try to prove these two ideas but together they can help form an idea that perhaps observations on the past actually influence the past and perhaps despite this &#39;observation after the fact&#39; there&#39;s still free will.It&#39;s not provable but then neither is the &#34;there&#39;s no such thing as free will&#34; arguments that this sort of research leads to. The point of the above is to highlight that there&#39;s still a way out for free will."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"1. 90% of the Application&#39;s Data are already in my LinkedIN, or my CV / Resume. Why the heck do I have to fill it in again.2. Some companies even / still requires you bring your University Certificate or whatever as proof. For Pete sake. That was decades ago. Can I pay $5 to LinkedIn or whatever so once and for all they can verify it from there.3. The other 8% of the application that I have not included details in my CV/ Resume or LinkedIn could have been reused across all applications. Why do I have rewrite it again.4. You are not fucking suppose to verify or reference check on me before I even had my interview or offer. So now my boss / management knows I am job hunting?5. By the time I get to the end of the application I am already exhausted depending how bad the day I had. And some form of PTSD from previous interview where i had to contain my thermonuclear anger or else going absolute animal against the HR / agent / interviewer. Because I have to be professional.6. My thought on why all these are so bad is because job application, listing site, social network ( LinkedIn ) all work for hiring companies, they are the ones who pay them. And not job seekers. Someone needs to figure out a way where we can turn this around and empower ( I hate this word, but I dont have anything better in my vocab ) employees."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I m one of these, i fill out the form, then i get the memories i had interacting with some of these companies, working at other companies. The Process-Dementia, the hostilitys, the relentless culture of using all things in human interaction as renegotiation ammonition. The relentless pressure, ignoring all social norms and employee health, to complete a task. The shallow friendliness, that ended as soon as your usefullness expired. The internal fights, silos and slightly drunk employees, who hated it there, but couldnt say it, cause big Brother Middle Management is everywhere.Its considered the &#34;good jobs&#34; in my area, as in well paid enough to own a house, but every time im tempted to apply and see the logos, and the memories come back, i abort these applications.Some companies are cesspools and its good to remember that and stay away from them. I also warn others to stay away from them. Some people hack these companies and get the easy life there, which is nice, but for people who actually want to work and not interact with such a culture.. not even as customers, if it can be avoided."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Recently I wanted to apply to a company. First they had you read some weird document telling you how they can’t pay high salaries, so you should be modest with your expectations.Then further down the form they require you to record a video introducing yourself and telling them why they should hire you.Ended up closing the form right there.Do these people not realize how annoying their process is and how talented people don’t have to put up with crap like this?"</p>

      rs: Emulated 600 frames in  0.37s (1626fps)

Usually I wait for a few months for things to settle in first."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"When I first entered the working world as a programmer and administrator of an &#34;academic computing center&#34;, in the early 70s, you met men like Ray - ex-military, GI-bill educated, learned computers from the electricity on up in their mid-career, rather frequently, either as customer engineers for one of the big mainframe manufacturers (there were 7 or 8, depending on when and how you counted), or from the minicomputer upstarts who were then assaulting the mainframe world of computing with their smaller, cheaper, 12 and 16 bit newcomers.   Sometimes you&#39;d get the privilege of a lunch or dinner with one sent out &#34;from the lab&#34; who was actually designing and building the machines you were working on.It&#39;s hard to explain just how new it all felt, then.   But in 1973, even though we were sitting on the cusp of the single chip microprocessor and personal computer revolution, the commercial computer was less than 20 years old, and college recruiting materials might well brag that at their institution, there were not one, but two computers on campus.  I remember the day the total RAM at our institution passed the megabyte mark - closer to the end, than the beginning, of the 1970s.  The ability to &#34;program&#34; was a rare skill - even the people  who taught it were still just learning it."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"If the minimalist resume is appealing, can we also bring back walk-on hiring?In warehouse and construction work, if someone shows up at 7:30 AM on a Monday morning, odds are quite good that the foreman will have something for them to do. Maybe not that day, but maybe tomorrow, or maybe someone on the list above them won&#39;t show up that week and they&#39;ll get called. I made rent doing that in my early 20s and they even let me leave early sometimes to work on my internet business because I didn&#39;t have a family to support and maybe someone else had a bill they needed to pay and wanted my shift.Why again does boutique startup need to interview 500 overqualified people? Hire someone right away and let them quit if they want to and hire someone else. It&#39;s just business for crying out loud."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I&#39;ve had more ideas come to me after hiding in my office to take a nap than sitting at my desk. It got to be such a gold mine of solutions that I still to this day allocate 30 minutes of my day to a nap. Non-negotiable. So many hard problems that have been brought to me, or complicated needs for architecture, etc were solved by simply turning my active brain off. When I was in graduate school I&#39;d regularly get stuck on some stupid thing I didn&#39;t understand and slamming my head against the paper/book/whatever didn&#39;t help. Again, a quick nap and I was good (or at least better than I was).Performative work is a disaster. I worked in a stuffy IT office of a company before I got my degree and became a software engineer. It took YEARS to deprogram performative work. I still hide when I take a nap. I suspect that if my current company found out I was sleeping on the job they&#39;d still be upset with me. However, my output is so good the results speak for themselves. It would be difficult to fire me for napping."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Software development is creative work. Creative insight can come anywhere, any time. Better ideas can make difficult things easy. And make the impossible– possible.So the most important thing on a software team (or really any team creating high technology products or services) is an environment where team members feel safe to be themselves– psychologically safe, where they can try out new things, make mistakes, fail, and not be punished or belittled. Say their ideas and have them improved by others, not criticized. It&#39;s an environment where team members take care of themselves so they can be creative– sleep enough, exercise enough, be with friends and family enough, play enough.You have to be at your keyboard or lab bench or whatever enough to make things. But if you are there too much your creativity plummets. This is what I try to get across to my teams."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The better error messages alone make it worthwhile to upgrade. The trend started in 3.10, and it already made a difference for me, my coworkers and students.But remember that while it&#39;s great to play with it freshly out of the oven, and that you might want to test your projects/libs with it, we should wait a bit before migrating production.Indeed, every first release of a new major version of Python eventually important bugs that get ironed out in a later patch. Also, some libs on pypi may simply not be compatible with it yet, breaking your pip install.I usually wait until the 3rd patch myself, after many years of paying the price of greedy upgrades."</p>

I am really happy with that decision.Parcel is plenty fast and is pretty much zero config, I can use it to build libraries[2] as well as applications[3] for the browser and node.I am manly building client side react applications, so your mileage may vary.[1] https://parceljs.org/[2] https://parceljs.org/getting-started/library/[3] https://parceljs.org/getting-started/webapp/"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"These bundlers do not do the same work as webpack. Turbopack is using swc for typescript which means it will not do typechecking during compilation which effectively makes it fairly useless as a compiler. Now, if you only want bundling and minification then sure but why would anyone want only bundling? Good luck having a sensible workflow when your type checking has to run separately and perfectly match whatever typescript version is hidden inside your bundler, good luck dealing with constant mismatches when there are errors on either side.EDIT: The responses pointed out that the author is the maintainer of webpack, I removed that part of the comment calling it deceptive. Maybe the entire intent is to deprecate webpack. I still think that it should be renamed to &#34;Turbopack: our webpack successor&#34; because calling it &#39;the&#39; successor is a bit presumptuous and the article doesn&#39;t even directly say that."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"It&#39;s unfortunate that some of what made MacOS great for developers is now being phased out in favor of features that are lifted out of iOS. Apple has made developer-hostile moves over the years that seem out of line with it&#39;s old &#39;think different&#39; ethos. I hope Apple takes this customer segment seriously and reverses course here, but I&#39;m not super hopeful.The real problem is that there isn&#39;t a reasonable alternative. Windows is out of the question for me due to not being a POSIX-based OS. WSL isn&#39;t integrated deeply enough and is still a pain in the ass to use coming from MacOS. I experimented with using a mostly stock Xubuntu setup for a bit and also found the user experience to be really subpar. Call me old, but I have no interest in dealing with the amount of configuration and tweaking necessary to be productive in a Linux environment.Ultimately, I&#39;m just going to stick it out with MacOS."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"It&#39;s so interesting, these waves of CSS improvements.Before the flexbox/grid arrival, there were years of near-zero progress.The flexbox/grid release, uniquely coordinated across browsers (for once), was an excellent milestone, but not really a movement.These last 2 years though feel almost like a revolution in comparison to CSS&#39;s history. Somebody is pushing very hard.These are some very serious improvements that address core needs and gaps. In particular scaling CSS in large applications, with things like @layers, @scope and container queries.The second goal seems to be to make CSS preprocessors obsolete.Compliments to whoever is working on this. My favorite upcoming one has to be toggle, controversial or not, the idea that for simple interactions you don&#39;t even require JS anymore is a good development.The luxury problem this creates is the slow adoption rate. Something extraordinarily powerful as grid is still barely used. Old habits die hard."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Great overview. I&#39;m always excited by newer features to CSS that make older JS-only methods obsolete. I&#39;ve also grown CSS-tooling fatigued after using SASS and PostCSS plugins for years. I&#39;ve recently gone back to only using vanilla CSS on personal projects and while there are niceties I do miss (nesting) it&#39;s refreshing not having to deal with config files or waiting for stuff to compile."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">":has() basically removes the need for us to use JS to attach classes to parent elements as we can essentially look ahead now, e.g. &#34;.some-component:has(.input-select-all:checked) { background: blue }&#34; whereas we would have to use JS to query the input, then query the parent and attach some css class as a styling hook.Container queries will allow us to fine-tune the not-so-predictable gaps between our predictable breakpoints.  Breakpoints will probably still be used for larger-picture layout, but container queries will help with the smaller parts especially in UI that have many moving dynamic parts.The rest are just icing and honestly I wouldn&#39;t be surprised if it takes a while for many of them to become mainstream."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This is a confusing headline. The judgement here is in NY state court, and pertains to employees of and in the City of New York, which enacted a vaccine requirement for employees of the city and later private employers in the city. Months later, Eric Adams was elected mayor of NYC, and he issued an executive order exempting athletes, performers, and artists from the mandate.Petitioners sued, saying that the mandate with the exemptions was essentially arbitrary, and the courts agreed. So what happened here is that Eric Adams sabotaged NYC&#39;s vaccine mandate."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Because it&#39;s confusing: the NY Supreme Court is just a trial court, it&#39;s not at all like the US Supreme Court. The top appellate court is called the Court of Appeals. It&#39;s called &#34;supreme&#34; because it has general jurisdiction, as opposed to things like traffic court."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Something I&#39;ve been wondering in recent cases where courts are overturning recent government action, whether unconstitutional bills passed into law, or unconstitutional executive actions that overstep authority, is where&#39;s the penalty for committing those actions in the first place?The state of New York famously responded to the outcome of NYSRPA v. Bruen, which overturned the defacto ban on concealed carry, by declaring nearly all public spaces &#34;sensitive areas&#34; in which licensed individuals may not carry for their protection. Regardless of one&#39;s opinion of said rights, how do courts blatantly ignore rulings and orders from higher courts with no repercussions?How do courts declare certain executive orders unconstitutional, and yet the perpetrators, who took an oath to uphold and defend said rights and values, face no consequences?"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I came on board with the NeXT acquisition (or rather reverse acquisition as ex-NeXT often refer to)…So I do recall seeing a few times after we relocated to Infinite Loop, that Steve at first was just working as a consultant, and not as an employee. Thus at the time he didn’t have a badge to enter in IL1 (Infinite Loop 1: hold Apple HQ); many times when he was coming in the morning, he had to wait at the glass door to enter the campus, until some kind soul was letting him in (despite the policy only badged employees could enter or visitors with a printed tag). I saw it happening more than once while grabbing a coffee at the coffee booth in the IL1 building.Later on, after he came back officially as CEO (or iCEO), I remember clearly during a lunch with co-workers (at Café Mac, seating outside) watching at a distance Steve &amp; Jony walking inside the campus, then seating at a bench and Jony opening some carrying case/luggage, and let Steve pull the content out of it, so he could look at it in the sun: it looked like a piece of plastic… at the time, we had no clue what it was, except the color was orange. 
Many months later, Steve introduced the first iBook (which was the first Mac with Wifi): when I saw the orange color of the iBook I made the connection with what we saw back that day; Jony was most likely showing to Steve the first shell of the future iBook.Steve otherwise at work was truly laser focus at a time on different projects: I was working on backend web services development with public facing web site, so usually every 2 weeks our boss was presenting to Steve our progress (every week or even more while closer to ship): our boss usually was always coming back with clear feedback on what was good or terrible, which we obviously had to improve for the next presentation… stressful yes, but truly enjoyable.
More than once, Steve did cut some projects that were close to finish and you just had to go along since no one had a say in it, except Steve.Obviously I have a few more stories of that sort, since I spent close to 20 years at Apple (/NeXT).It was quite something to get the hard work you did for months presented on stage by Steve… I still miss the excitement from it even if it is more than 15 years ago.Edit: fixing a few typos"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I was there in 1999 as OS X was being developed, and the beta was just about to be released. I was building another product that was released at MacWorld in 2000 (and still exists today)!I have a lot of funny stories.  Steve didn&#39;t like our data center rack mounts being silver, we had to pull them all out and spray paint them black, because silver just wasn&#39;t acceptable, in a datacenter. That was my first day at work. And no, I&#39;m not a datacenter employee, everyone on the team did everything, there were just very few of us.We had to work from about 10am to about 3 or 4 am every day to make the deadline, we sometimes got Sundays off. There was a lot of rage and anger at many management levels.Steve would get a question about a two button mouse at every company meeting, he was super pissed every time about the question. We enjoyed trolling him.Steve&#39;s attention to detail was unbelievable. I once witnessed him make a team work overnight just to move an icon 10 pixels to the left.The guy had a vision that seems unparalleled. He was able to figure out the concept of &#34;cloud&#34; well before its time, and make a shift towards that.Of course, he was an supernatural presenter. I witnessed him present through some really messed up errors in live demos and no one I asked in the audience afterwards even noticed the errors.It was an insane work environment, never seen anything like it."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;m really thankful I had a chance to work at 1 Infinite Loop during that time. I worked with other Developer Relations folks in IL3, with near-daily trips to IL2 to either meet with folks on the QuickTime team or just hang out. Occasionally I&#39;d get early glimpses at things like QTi and HyperCard 3.I vividly recall the day Steve introduced the iMac in the Infinite Loop quad. If I had to pick a day that telegraphed Apple&#39;s future fortunes, it would be that day. Rhapsody&#39;s potential was compelling, but as Macintosh OS it was still pretty Crapsody at the time. The iMac was a Real Thing — as friendly as computers get, that only Apple could&#39;ve created and sold."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"My late father, who was a software developer by trade before his retirement, had a desktop machine set up running Windows 7 (probably?) that he used for checking email, and buying stuff online.A few years later, when he had been diagnosed with cancer and was on chemo, it updated itself to Windows 10 without his explicit consent. It completely fucked up the install, and was unusable for him from then on. He was too tired to go through the process of getting it sorted out, and was thus unable to book a vacation that he had intended to take to recover from that round of chemo.Microsoft&#39;s unfriendly us-first, customers-second process robbed him of his last holiday and I will not easily forgive them for it.If a seasoned developer can be robbed of quality of life by this flavour of bullshit, what chance do the non-technical types stand?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I don&#39;t get it. For a few more bucks they instantly get their brand connonated with slowness and being unreliable.How do manufacturers throw in all the crapware and expect a good user experience and happy customers? Oh of course, they don&#39;t care.I&#39;ve moved to Mac but back in days I used Windows, the VERY FIRST thing I did was to install a fresh copy of Windows, then install any necessary drivers which are absolutely required for proper function (I remember just finding the driver files and installing them manually from add hardware dialog instead of installing bloatware of the manufacturer).Wish things have changed in 10 years... apparently it didn&#39;t.And of course I&#39;m tech savvy. I don&#39;t see any less-savvy senior being able to solve this problem; it should be regulated in a way that there should be a mandatory and ugly label showing all the crapware included with the device while buying, perhaps even extra taxing for each crapware included, discouraging manufacturers from including them."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"These days I simply can&#39;t recommend anyone (especially nontechnical people) buy a computing device that isn&#39;t either:- An Apple device- First-party (Microsoft Surface, Pixel phone, etc)- Running Linux (assuming they can deal with everything else that comes with that)Even these aren&#39;t perfect, but everything else I assume to be hot garbage unless you&#39;re planning to install your own OS anyway. The problem, though, is that this mostly excludes the real budget-tier devices (at least for nontechnical folks), which is unfair to those who can&#39;t afford anything elseBurn it all down"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"One of the things that has kept me out of the cryptocurrency space is that when their advocates discuss value, they speak in pure nonsense.A big part of that problem is that value is very difficult to discuss. On the one hand you have the classic goldbug that insists that gold has &#34;intrinsic value&#34;, which is some sort of platonic ideal thing that gold simply ambiently has and defies any attempt to nail down what it grounds out in. On the other hand you have cryptocurrency advocates claiming that all value is arbitrary and/or based entirely on scarcity. In that context, observing that my kid&#39;s doodles are scarce but not valuable is not a cute tweet; it is a complete and utter demolishing of the argument.(I think one of the things education can accidentally (mis)teach is that short arguments are always worthless and arguments must always be long. This is false. A good grounding in mathematics can help with internalizing this. It is completely possible to demolish entire massive argument edifices in 10-20 of the correct words, and the fact that the &#34;other side&#34; has deployed literally hundreds of thousands of words does not make them right if the foundation is rotten.)Value is intrinsically a dynamic process. It grounds out in human desires, which are intrinsically temporal, variable, and fickle, and this makes a lot of people uncomfortable as they seek either a more solid or a more completely ethereal/arbitrary base. However, there is no other sensible way to think about value, however complex and ever-shifting this may be, and it is neither mathematically solid, nor an amorphous vapor of no consequence subject to one strong person&#39;s Nietzschian will."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This has been a concern of mine for a while; I have also published absolute garbage just to see how far I can take it. I&#39;ve published music under various pseudonyms, books underneath different pen-names... the list goes on. I&#39;ve retracted such publications, but it is frightening if one person like myself had the curiosity to try, what is already out there, and, what a well-funded nation-state actor could do.----Post-truth, like post-modernism, does not mean an absolute absence of truth, but a decline in confidence in common knowledge, making your own truth the center of your life, rather than a set of values   shared by a community.We now believe that our own truth is somehow better than the &#34;centralized&#34; or &#34;official&#34; truth. We are now free from the institutions and authorities that controlled the truth. But this is an illusion, because the very definition of truth requires trust in something other than you.[1] https://www.reddit.com/r/philosophy/comments/j5gyp5/the_sear..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I think there’s a good chance it was ghost written by a content farm for someone who wanted to publish a book in a popular category to make a quick buck. I recently learned that this is a soft-scam technique advocated for by a couple of guys called the Mikkelson Twins. They say you can make money by publishing audiobooks on audible by finding a popular topic on audible, then hiring a ghost writing service to write your book, then hire a voice actor to record it, publish it on audible, and then you too can become fabulously wealthy as the Mikkelson Twins claim to be. Except what the Mikkelson Twins actually make money on is selling you on a “money making course” where they tell you to do the above. So there’s all kinds of people trying to follow this method out there, it seems.This excellent video [1] from Dan Olson at Folding Ideas is in my opinion a fascinating deep dive in to this whole scam. I don’t want to spoil everything in the video, but Dan does an exceptional job exploring how this ghost writing works, and why it produces the kind of nonsense writing that looks like GPT-3 but is actually being done by an overworked human who is trying to write an entire novel in three weeks or so on a topic they haven’t had time to properly research.[1] https://youtu.be/biYciU1uiUw"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Pigs were recorded in Domesday as having woodland to support them. Note that woodlands supporting pigs was primarily comprised of oak, since the pigs fed on the acorns they dropped.Source 1: https://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/domesday/discover-domesd...In the modern world, you can manage about 5 pigs per acre. You should be able to do that many pigs or more per acre in the medieval world since the animals were physically smaller for the most part. So in an 80 acre pannage woodland, expect about 400 swine.Some tree types are far more damaged by pig foraging than others since, if they don&#39;t get the yummy acorns, they tend to dig up roots, eat the saplings and do other damage. So the oak and the pig are good neighbors. The elder or the olive tree, or even the wild apple tree, all tend to suffer far more damage when used as pannage.Source 2: https://acrcd.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Pigs-and-Trees...."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Reminds me of a passage in Jesse Schell&#39;s game design book. Playtesters were confused seeing flags of pirate ships blow forward, toward the front of the ship. They were told that sailing ships have the wind at their backs, so everything blows forward. However, so many playtesters were confused and made comments that they just made the flags blow back.Maybe it was the same with the pigs; people just want to see pigs squealing around town, adding to the atmosphere of the game."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"While I really like their lightweight, SQL-like protocol instead of Elasticsearch&#39;s fat JSON, I really think that this project could have much more impact if it could be a drop-in replacement for ES.Even if it offers only a fraction of the features offered by ES, that may be fair enough for at least half of the use-cases out there.Sonic could have really had a strong selling point: &#34;Use an ES-alternative that works fine in most of the real-world applications, but it&#39;s written in Rust and it only takes a fraction of the memory footprint required by ES, and it shouldn&#39;t require you to change your application code&#34;.Instead, they are proposing yet another search protocol, that developers have to learn and adopt. That definitely increases the adoption barriers."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Wow it&#39;s weird that this comes up, I&#39;m actually running a site I am going to repost to HN today that I want to use as a testbed for search engines (kind of like an extension to my recent collaboration with supabase[0]).Right now I&#39;ve got the site going on just Postgres FTS + trigram and it&#39;s pretty darn fast, looks like I need to test sonic too.Going to burn some midnight oil (in my timezone, anyway) and get it out -- though sonic isn&#39;t implemented yet!Anyway to make this comment useful to people, here&#39;s my short list of engines that I want to run in parallel:- MeiliSearch (https://github.com/meilisearch/MeiliSearch)- TypeSense (https://github.com/typesense/typesense)- Lyra (https://github.com/LyraSearch/lyra)- OpenSearch (https://github.com/opensearch-project/OpenSearch)- ZincSearch (https://github.com/prabhatsharma/zinc)- Sonic (https://github.com/valeriansaliou/sonic)There isn&#39;t enough out there comparing all these for the simple typical fuzzy search/search box usecase, so I&#39;m adapting a little podcast search site I made to try and use all of these at the same time. So far only Postgres though, will try and add Meilisearch today and post it!Like other people are pointing out, most of these engines won&#39;t have all the features of ES (or more accurately Lucene) but I am pretty convinced that most of the time it doesn&#39;t actually matter and if someone is searching on your site excessively maybe there&#39;s a problem with your UX (unless you&#39;re a search engine or repository of information).[0]: https://supabase.com/blog/postgres-full-text-search-vs-the-r..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;ve written a full-text search engine as well. I don&#39;t tout it as a replacement for Elasticsearch, but it does have a few advantages: it&#39;s fast; supports HTML documents; supports Polish inflection (via a full-blown morphological dictionary, not just a stemmer); and has a very compact on-disk format (pre-parsed HTML trees, Huffman-encoded over large alphabets). Oh, and it&#39;s 100% Clojure.It underlies a concordancer GUI called Smyrna: https://github.com/nathell/smyrna, https://smyrna.danieljanus.plI haven&#39;t touched it in six years, other than a few small changes. But I do plan on revisiting it when time permits."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Here in the ultra-dense Netherlands, threats to insects are magnified. As such, it&#39;s easier to point to specific causes.Butterflies: 50% reduction in 50 years. Beetles: 75% decline since 1985. Ladybugs: 50% reduction in 20 years. Across the border in Germany: a 75% decline in flying insects since 1989.It doesn&#39;t take much of a scientist to see the trend. I&#39;ve been hiking the forests here multiple times per week for 20 years. You can clearly see how some groups are disappearing whilst others remain.There&#39;s several root causes but the primary one is a lack of native plant diversity. Since agriculture over here is done in close proximity to forests, the soil becomes acid due to the nitrogen disposition. This benefits the growth of a handful of plants at the expense of all others. In some of our forests, the soil is now so acid that snails no longer develop a case and bird eggs collapse.In this plant monoculture, insects depending on a specific host plant disappear. Outside (protected) forests, things aren&#39;t much better. Even the tiniest of strips of grass that would normally produce wildflowers, are aggressively mowed down. People&#39;s gardens are designed to be as hostile to insects as is possible.Secondary reasons are invasive species and light pollution.It&#39;s a sad state of affairs and one we should be deeply ashamed of. We&#39;re not talking about some iconic predator requiring hundreds of acres of wild forest just to survive. We&#39;re talking about insects that require little space, healthy soil, a flower, and for it to be left alone. We can&#39;t even offer that."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This article is  pretty characteristic of the chemical industry influence trying to muddle the waters.I&#39;ve watched recently a conference[1] by several renowned scientists. They affirm that neonicotinoids / neonics are responsible of at least 80% of the decline.They also affirm that the &#34;merchants of doubt&#34; are working their best to muddle the evidence with things like &#34;there are multiple factors&#34;, &#34;it&#39;s complicated&#34;, &#34;we need more research&#34; etc.But just like the overwhelming majority of lung cancer comes from smoking, the overwhelming factor in insects decline (and its consequences like birds decline) is PESTICIDES and neonicotinoids in particular.[1]: sorry, in French : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6FQT7b2ExP4

								<p class="story__comment_others">"To everyone replying “aerodynamics”, I’ve had the same car for about 9 years now and the drive along the 5 from Bay Area to LA feels like there’s fewer bugs on my windshield (granted not recorded diligently for scientific purposes but whereas before I’d need to scrub the windshield at least once halfway these days I can drive all the way and still don’t need a wash at the end)Same goes for the argument that bugs have evolved to migrate away from the roads - the 5 has been a busy thruway for a long time with lots of cars and trucks.The article is short but says scientists have clear data that populations have plummeted and the larger vehicle consumer trend + more people on the road means that there’s fewer bugs to encounter per windshield on top of that."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Why are plastics 3-7 allowed if they are unable to be recycled? Also it seems to me that a tax on plastic might incentivise glass and metal usage.  Plastic is only used for convenience and cheapness, let&#39;s make it less convenient and cheap than glass and metal."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Perhaps the best way to prevent pollution of the environment with plastics is to ban the export of plastics as garbage. Currently, much of the plastic pollution is due to dumping in 2nd world and 3rd world countries where rules on disposal are very lax. So, while many people are actually quite conscientious and dispose of their waste in the appropriate manner, the garbage then just gets exported and not disposed of in any way that is responsible. Stopping the export also forces the originator of the garbage to deal with their waste creation... so dual benefit.Of course, eWaste is also a sizable contributor to plastic pollution and most people don&#39;t even think about disposable of these items. They either sell them, or they toss them in the garbage... sometimes with lithium batteries still in them which is extremely hazardous."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I&#39;m a Linux idiot, just got sick of Windows, and took the plunge in 2016. (After some ill-fated tinkering in 1996 with Slackware, but we don&#39;t speak of that.) I started with Ubuntu and had a pretty good time for a year or two, until a dist-upgrade broke everything. Luckily /home/ was easy to restore from backup.So I was fine for another two years on Ubuntu until another dist-upgrade broke everything again. Sensing a pattern, I decided to give Pop a try.I&#39;m now about a year into Pop and sure enough, a few weeks ago a dist-upgrade broke a lot of things, but unlike Ubuntu, I was able to find System76&#39;s tech support page, I ran the commands it suggested, and everything&#39;s fine again!https://support.system76.com/articles/package-manager-ubuntu...Miraculous, I tell you.I still can&#39;t figure out why there are multiple versions of some things in the Pop Shop, but they all seem to work, so I&#39;m not complaining, it&#39;s just weird. Someday I&#39;ll figure out this whole tiling-windows thing, but I think that&#39;s for people with bigger screens so I turned it off so my alt-tab reflexes work again.In general, it just works, and that&#39;s more than I can say for Windows or Ubuntu at this point."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I really like Pop Os. I&#39;ve always liked Debian descended distros, and prior to this I was using Ubuntu. While I like it, I always found a lot of rough edges esp. when it came to proprietary drivers, etc. where things didn&#39;t always work without some tweaking. Pop Os on the other hand seems to &#34;just work&#34; - it is like a polished version of Ubuntu with a nice selection of apps in the Pop Shop. Theme is pretty nice as well as a bonus."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I am quite a fan of their Pop!_Shell. I wanted to improve my desktop efficiency by using a tiling window manager; I tried i3wm and XMonad, but none of them really clicked with me. Finally, I decided to try the Pop!_Shell tiling mode and it was awesome. (Hardcore tiling window manager fans might not agree but Pop!_Shell is a lot more newbie-friendly.)Furthermore, you don&#39;t even have to install Pop!_OS to get Pop!_Shell. For example my preferred distribution is openSUSE Tumbleweed with GNOME, so I just need to    sudo zypper install gnome-shell-extension-pop-shell
    wget https://github.com/pop-os/shell/raw/master_jammy/scripts/configure.sh
    # configure.sh mostly configures keyboard shortcuts. Inspect it before running.
    sh ./configure.sh
    
And then enable it. That&#39;s all."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The update is cool but the update process was not.  -Update available, wanna install?
  Sure
  -OK don&#39;t mind me I&#39;m gonna need a while
  OK
  -HA HA I LIED I&#34;M READY TO TERMINATE EVERYTHING BYEEEE
  WTF
  5 reboots with just an Apple icon and a progress bar
  The progress bar also moves backwards sometimes
  I guess it&#39;s a metaphor for life, which is how long this seems to be taking
  -OK hello I am back but I need 10 minutes of alone time
  -Here is some unfamiliar wallpaper but you can log in I guess
  -Oh it&#39;s you again, do you want to share analytics with us
  -OK here is your familiar desktop, I am not telling you what has changed
  Um preferences
  -Oh hai I&#39;m called Settings now and I reorganized everything
  Yikes but OK this is sorta well laid out I guess
  -Hello I am Stage Manager, I put a desktop on your desktop so you can work while you work
  Sorta neat, can I configure some things differently though
  -No
  
Funnily enough I had just started reading the Ars Technica review when the upgrade took place so that helped with navigating the changes but it was an oddly jarring transition. I get that Apple doesn&#39;t like burdening users with too much technical information (as in &#39;any&#39;) but given how significantly the Settings app has changed I&#39;m surprised there was no Release notes or feature tour of any kind."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"So the real complaint is dynamic pricing, which is essentially raising prices to what the market will bear, instead of having (what was formerly artificially) low prices that get scalped. Now the extra money that used to go to scalpers goes to TM instead, and the downside is that some % of fans that could previously luck out and get cheap tickets no longer can.Isnt this...not a bad thing? There&#39;s fundamentally just a supply and demand problem, with more people wanting to see these concerts than there are concerts. The article mentions that Garth brooks solved this by doing more concerts (e.g. 9 in a row in the same city!), but that&#39;s obviously not viable for everyone. Is there a better solution? Even if there were 5 different companies selling concert tickets, wouldnt they inevitably move to dynamic pricing for the same reason?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I sometimes wonder why venues choose Ticketmaster; large as Ticketmaster is it&#39;s not the only option, and how did they come to be the main player? My only conclusion is that the venues (and bands) are benefiting.Here&#39;s my theory:Venues and bands know that for PR reasons they can&#39;t jack up the price of tickets, but they don&#39;t want to miss out on the revenue from people willing to pay scalper prices. So they set tickets at a nominal price but reserve huge blocks of tickets for the band and venues. Nominally these are &#34;family and friends&#34; tickets, but in practice the band and venue put them immediately for resale. This way the bands and venues can get that gigantic revenue. Meanwhile a small number of tickets are sold at face value and immediately sell out.  Ticketmaster profits from fees on the ticket sales and resales.A &#34;known evil&#34; company like ticketmaster is now a benefit, as &#34;obviously&#34; the jacked up costs are ticketmaster&#39;s fault. Meanwhile ticketmaster is really just a service to take the heat off of bands and venues for what would otherwise be seen as price gauging."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Lots of comments here from people who haven’t read the article and don’t know about the scalper-eliminating on-demand pricing it’s actually about. Or that it addresses supply-and-demand near the end with some interesting comments on Garth Brooks:Country superstar Garth Brooks—who has called out dynamic pricing as well as suggested that the secondary market should be “illegal,” has more or less solved the problem for his fans with one simple trick: He adds shows until they no longer sell out. In recent years, on single tours, Brooks has done the following: He played nine concerts in a row in Edmonton, Canada. He played a dozen shows in Chicago. He played six in Kansas, nine in Tulsa, and eight in Denver.Indeed, the headline doesn’t seem particularly supported by the actual article to me."</p>

Also it might be nice to have a first-person vew, maybe the camera view contributes to the sluggish feeling.I love the procedurally-generated landscapes. It really captures the feeling of driving on unfamiliar roads.I&#39;m curious how the physics works. Is this using raycast wheels? A couple of years ago I made a racing game for Oculus Quest using Godot[0], based on Godot&#39;s &#34;VehicleBody&#34;, and getting the physics to work satisfactorily was a major headache.

								<p class="story__comment_others">"This would be great for Rally racing games, since it&#39;s all about reacting to unknown terrain.Also, it would be better if mouse steering is damping impulse based, i.e. every frame the steering position exponentially decays, mouse position resets to center and the change is added as impulse on the steering position.  sensitivity = max_ang / ( screenwidth/2 )
  decay_rate = 6.0

  frame(dt){
    dx = mouse.x - center_pos

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Having your own email/domain isn’t about privacy. Email has become essentially the key to almost everything in modern life. If I lose access to my email I lose access to basically everything I own and it would be a massive hassle to switch emails. Banks, schools, apps, etc. Often times these services won’t even let you change to a new email if you don’t have access to an existing one. Some use email as 2factor. It’s a nightmare. Owning your own domain separately is crucial. Who hosts your email matters less."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I think this is everywhere. In India, people in the departments, especially the Governments usually ask, &#34;What is your Gmail?&#34; Almost everyone uses Gmail here and it is extremely rare to find their own custom domain.I&#39;m actually surprised that the Government Departments do not have a service that takes care of these! They will fine Google but almost all of the government email IDs are Gmail.I was one of those that distributed hundreds if not thousands of Gmail invites when it started. However, since 2010-ish, I left Gmail to be just for Newsletters, and the ones that I&#39;m not serious about. I&#39;m always reminded that a day will come when I will just have no access, lock out and be done with it.I had used my name&#39;s domain and had used the web hosting provided email service and I felt nice using the likes of `webmaster@brajeshwar.com` (early 2000s). Then I got a shorter domain with our family domain and is, now, powered by Google Workspace (with a plan to move to the competitors soon before the yearly plan expires). I had so many domains under the Google Suite free version since its beta. I did upgraded my primary domain to the paid version, when I had few mail delivery issues so I can talk to a person and that was also the time I realize I cannot go back. That was almost/about 10 years ago."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Unpopular on HN, but I just don&#39;t see a problem with Google having my email, for what they provide me.

Very much a labor of love and a surprising way to realize I still liked programming. I wrote some scattered thoughts here [0]I also &#34;run&#34; this project quite differently than I usually do - when I receive a pull request instead of merging it I do a quick glance through the user&#39;s github to make sure they&#39;re not a spammer before giving them _commit access_ and asking them to merge their own PR [1]. It has worked wonders.[0]: https://notes.jordanscales.com/ffa53b57[1]: https://twitter.com/jdan/status/1528026508564078593"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;ve previously attempted this for Windows 95. I tried very hard to be pixel-accurate. https://hikari.noyu.me/demos/ shows off a bit of what I achieved, but alas it lacks most of the UI elements.I learned some interesting things from the process. The biggest one for me is that web browsers have only one kind of focus, but Windows has two, a dotted line on the inside (element affected by space bar) and a black outline (element affected by return key). You therefore can&#39;t get exactly the same UI in a browser without adding some JS to simulate this second type of focus."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"My biggest concern about this is that now it is in Emacs, there&#39;s no easy way to contribute to it, or follow development. Previously it was on GitHub and there was zero friction to contributing other than figuring out your elisp changes. But now, I think that Issues in the github site are discouraged, and so there will be no convenient way of watching issues and feature requests raised against the project, or of following discussion of proposed patches and code review. In principle of course, these things are possible by using old issue tracking applications and following often dysfunctional/cantankerous discussions in a email list, both of whose scope is the whole of emacs."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Interesting, I&#39;ve been using &#34;the other one&#34;: lsp-mode, and have been quite happy with the results. Will see how eglot has progressed and if I can slim my config a bit."</p>

Now if you&#39;re intending on moving to a new hosting service that doesn&#39;t do that (cgi-bin), all Google search results to your site will 404.Github pages and likely others also supports this format, so moving between those two services doesn&#39;t exhibit this problem. Moving to cgi-bin will.I&#39;d suggest Cloudflare shouldn&#39;t try to establish their scheme as canonical url and rather implement github pages behavior, but what do I know...

Everyone in the field knows it.99% of those using this tactics use it to justify not releasing their models to avoid giving competition a leg up(Google, openAI) and to pretend they are for &#34;open research&#34;. As I said this is 100% bull.The remaining 1% are either doing this to inflate their egos (&#34;hey look how considerate and enlightened we are in everything we do!&#34;), or they pander to media/silly politicians/various clueless commentators whose level of knowledge about this technology is null. They regurgitate the same set of &#34;what ifs and horror stories&#34; to scare the public into standing by when they attempt to over regulate another field so they can be kingmakers within it(if you want an example how it works look at the energy sector).All this sillyness accomplishes is to raise a barrier to entry for potential commercial competition. Bad actors will have enough money/lack scruples to train their own models or to steal your best ones regardless how &#34;impact conscious&#34; your company it.Now, I don&#39;t claim everyone should be forced to publish their AI models. No, if you spent lots of money on training your model it is yours. But you can&#39;t lock all your work behind closed doors and call yourself open. It doesn&#39;t work like this. One important point is that there is value even in just publishing a paper demonstrating some achievements of a proprietary model, but if the experiment can&#39;t be reproduces based on description given that is not science and for sure it is not open."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Let&#39;s be realistic, just like building codes, medical procedures and car manufacturing sooner or later we will also be subject to regulations. The times where hacking culture and tech was left unbothered are over.Twenty years ago we were free to do whatever we want, because it didn&#39;t matter. Nowadays everyone uses tech as much as they use stairs. You can&#39;t build stairs without railings though.Keeping the window for abuse small is beneficial to the whole industry. Otherwise bad press will put pressure on politicians to &#34;do something about it&#34; resulting in faster and more excessive regulations."</p>

Technology has empowered small groups or even single individuals to create things that have the potential to change the course of civilization, so I for sure hope those individuals think twice about the potential consequences of their actions. How would you feel about people releasing a $100 &#39;build your own Covid-variant&#39; kit?"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I think there is a bit of an issue here that isn&#39;t addressed in the article. They reference using the SpaceX published ephemerides which are created from the GPS receivers onboard the SpaceX satellites:&#34;SpaceX satellites regularly downlink accurate orbital information from onboard GPS. We use this orbital information, combined with planned maneuvers, to accurately predict future ephemerides, which are uploaded to Space-Track.org three times per day&#34; [0]So using the positioning information of the SpaceX satellites is already dependent on GPS. Saying that it could be used as a backup to GPS is a bit non-sensical to me. Sure you could go back to using ranging measurements for each of the satellites to get TLEs from NORAD or LeoLabs or one of the other commercial space tracking companies, but it would likely be less accurate and not updated as frequently as the SpaceX satellites don&#39;t have a precision clock onboard for timing and propagation like the GPS satellites do.[0] https://www.spacex.com/updates/index.html"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"GPS is also coupled with WAAS which relies on a network of ground stations at known coordinates to determine GPS error. These errors are caused by bulges in the ionosphere that throw off timing. Error is calculated, broadcast up to satellites and then rebroadcast down to GPS receivers that are WAAS enabled. This is known as a satellite based augmentation system. The other satellite nav systems that compete with GPS are building similar augmentation systems (like GAGAN, EGNOS, MSAS and SDCM). These systems are required for precision approaches like LPV for aircraft on instrument flight plans. Regular GPS precision due to ionosphere changes is too low. They&#39;ve enabled the FAA to lower the minimums for GPS approaches down to levels that are close to ILS, removing the need for expensive ILS installations at many regional airports. So replacing GPS isn&#39;t just about creating a system to locate a point in space. You&#39;d need to replace critical systems like WAAS that enable precision approaches during instrument conditions, for example."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Massively impressive! A very exciting paper https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.12334v4 from the first two authors shows how Starlink can be fused with ordinary GNSS to get extremely impressive +56 dB anti-jam advantage (see Figure 1)."</p>

Pocket Casts is one of the only applications that&#39;s survived me bouncing between iOS and Android and back again over the last who-knows-how-many years and I paid for their web player a long time ago, too. I&#39;ve tried other players and none of them stick; the differences in affordances in something like Castro or Overcast send me back to Pocket Casts every time.They seem to have had a rough time of it over the last few years, and seeing them end up at Automattic (&#34;land of the misfit web toys&#34;) was nice. This is a cherry on top."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Best part of PocketCast is the stats. It can tell me that since 2016 I&#39;ve listened to 135 days worth of podcasts and apparently I&#39;ve &#34;saved&#34; 46 days by increasing the playback speed and 3 days from trimming silence. (I also have 350 hours in my &#34;up next&#34; queue ...)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"After being a user for many many years, I just recently tested out to Snipd [1] and have not looked back since.  Pocket Cast were great but I don&#39;t see them innovating. With Snipd there is almost always a full text transcript available including a surprisingly accurate AI generated Table of Contents to cue through.  Then I can easily save a transcribed clip of some section I am listening to  for export to a TfT program like obsidian.  Not sure how I ever lived without these features now I am used to them lol.[1]  https://www.snipd.com/"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This is a great step.  Subscriptions errode first sale protections by subscription-gating physical objects, allowing OEMs a work-around to first-sale doctrine.  If you buy something, you should own it, and be able to fix it, scrap it, re-sell it, whatever you want.It&#39;s interesting NJ included self-driving in the subscription ban.  These require significant overhead in compute, engineering resources and greatly impact safety, and if Tesla&#39;s pricing is any indication of overall market, FSD will cost a pretty penny.If full self-driving was offered at 10k up front for the life of the car, or $80/mo, I would imagine many buyers of lower-end vehicles would prefer a subscription."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Go New Jersey! Now get Texas and California on board so car companies don&#39;t bother offering these in the country at all"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I think this is great, and though I agree that determining whether there is an &#34;on-going cost to the manufacturer&#34; will be a gray area that automakers will try to game, I think that&#39;s a solvable problem.The heated seats example is a great one. There is no reason for this not be a one-time charge.On the other hand, I think it&#39;s fair to offer autopilot/&#34;full self driving&#34; on a subscription, or at least the upgrades as a subscription. Clearly there is a large ongoing cost to continually improve self-driving capabilities, and it seems reasonable to me to have a pricing model that reflects that."</p>

Where the first cartel guy gets subdued is where I get my coffee, and the people that live in the canal houses are my neighbors. (My house may or may not be in the map, would have to play the game to check.)Fun facts:(1) A year or two ago several guys spent days using some sort of device to scan all buildings in our street. They got complaints from several bar owners and tenants as they appeared to be taking photographs inside the buildings, and they wouldn’t explain why. I wouldn’t be be surprised if it was for this map.(2) The footage is hyperrealistic not just graphically, they got the details right with surprising accuracy. Even the garbage bins are in exactly the right place. (It’s also not unlikely that a guy could be subdued like this without people being too surprised, as tourists like to use this district to get wasted 24/7.)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Though it does look great, i wish more games focused on actually being fun to play instead of having long cut scenes and micro transactions.Ironically other than the fact that you have to pay per game and that you’re often forced to die, I prefer arcade games. They generally minimize friction to playedit: to clarify, I mean games with good graphics specifically. There are many great games (especially indie) out there."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"It looks incredible.Although this beautiful recreation is missing the endless tourists aimlessly walking on bike paths and the very loud conversations between Dutch people (their talking volume is what many of us consider yelling, but that&#39;s just normal).Once we get VR headsets that are maybe twice as good as the best now, and we have high quality simulations, the scifi stories of people choosing living in unreality seem more plausible."</p>

A small fine and a promise not to do it any more. This should basically be the end of that company entirely. Instead they just have to point the finger at some low-level managers, fire them, and keep on rolling. I would think criminal charges are warranted for importing 12 and 13 year-olds for labor. The children can&#39;t consent. That&#39;s essentially child slave labor.If Hyundai/Kia drops them, that would at least be a much bigger penalty than the DOL imposed."</p>

I think it&#39;s a common misconception that coding/logic is difficult. I find the development setup and deployment to be much more complicated. As evidence, take a look at the impressive workarounds that citizen developers use to make things work in an easy environment like Excel.A keyboard and mouse probably solve most of the complaints in this thread."</p>

For example, under one class I created 9 units with a number of challenges under each unit. You copy that to a new class (Team is what they call it) and all sections disappear). Then if you want to reorganize, even if there are sections, you have to drag and drop, scrolling up or down the page and repeating the drag to get it to the right section.Another thing is when you organize sections there is no drag and drop, but arrows moving boxes up and down.I&#39;ve sent in dozens of issues for various bugs and annoyances, and even dug into the js to point out how to fix things, but after nearly 2 years they are still there."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I used to use Ubuntu for everything and was very happy in the massive Ubuntu ecosystem with a .deb for everything till I was forced to use Snap a few releases ago for installing even some basic utils I used on a daily basis. I then had Snap constantly hang on installs and just break for no apparent reason and waste my time debugging it. It didn&#39;t &#34;just work&#34; anymore.Swapped to Arch and haven&#39;t looked back yet, Arch took me a lot more work to get set up but once it was it&#39;s been pretty invisible, which is how I like my OS to be.I&#39;d probably happily swap back to Ubuntu if I read somewhere that Snap was removed entirely/canceled or something."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The regular as clockwork bi-yearly releases are one of the best things about Ubuntu. Ubuntu is the default supported Linux laptop/desktop env in so many tech orgs.If you use Ubuntu and want to help ensure it works for your env remember to test the upcoming release alphas / betas eg with USB boot stick and file bugs on Launchpad if you notice something broken.(Same goes for other distros your org may use, eg Debian, Fedora etc)Snaps mostly work great, and are a great improvement for keepign up to date sw available for people using LTS releases. This and the security improvements brought by the sandboxing greatly overshadow the sometime teething problems of the system."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;m not sure precisely why, but when I first saw ads in Apt(8) I decided I wouldn&#39;t be using Ubuntu for any more personal projects. On one hand they obviously need to keep the project alive. On the other hand, putting your own ads on top of something that fundamental to the system just felt ... weird/narsty?Reading state information... DoneCalculating upgrade...

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"It&#39;s not surprising at all. All of these review-driven P2P marketplace businesses end up with the same problem. After the initial phase of early adopters that offer generally high quality products, a flood of fake or low-quality listing tries to squeeze money out of the platform. These people are not listing their homes on Airbnb, they are trying to make a living by extracting as much money from the platform as they possibly can. They don&#39;t care if they&#39;re banned or reported. They&#39;ll just make a new fake account. Low ratings? No problem, just pay for some fake reviews.The same is true for Amazon and other marketplace business. It&#39;s overrun by Amazon FBA sellers selling cheap low-quality white-labeled Alibaba products. It&#39;s almost impossible to find real brands or high-quality products these days, unless you specifically know what to search for.How to deal with it? Personally I&#39;ve started going back to hotels to be safe. If I do use Airbnb, I do a lot of research on the host and reviews and assume the place I&#39;m getting is 80% worse than what the pictures show.Other examples: App Store app reviews, restaurant review apps and food delivery apps. Fortunately it&#39;s not a big deal if these are scams. It&#39;s just a few dollars. Sucks much more when it&#39;s your vacation rental."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This stuff is incredibly common in short term rental market.  You are scraping the bottom of the barrel on landlord scruples.There was a recent fire in a summer vacation town popular with NYers.
The town requires summer short term rental landlords to get a permit &amp; inspection.
The landlord did not get one.
The landlord also had sketchy kitchen wiring that was probably some sort of DIY and not up to code.
The landlord had removed batteries and hardwiring from 3 smoke detectors.
These are the kind of things the inspector would have found immediately.A family visiting from out of state lost 2 of their 3 children in this fire.Apps like AirBnB create the facade of officialness on what are instead very sketchy markets.  Family probably thought they were doing the right thing going through an app and the landlord must be verified and more &#34;legit&#34;.  Being from out of state they wouldn&#39;t know the intricacies of local town permit&amp;inspection requirements and how to check if the landlord has one, etc.Likewise in my condo in NYC, we had one particular owner who was trying to use their unit as an Airbnb.  Regardless of the local laws which were tightening up at the time, our condo expressly forbid short term rentals, and had language around minimum length of stay and lease approval requirements.  It only stopped when we started fining them $1000 per incident.Stuff like this matters because you buy a condo to live in it and don&#39;t expect the unit on the other side of your bedroom wall to essentially be a hotel room with new neighbors every 3 days, staying up all hours (vacation, yay), dragging suitcases in&amp;out at odd hours multiple times per week.. forever.The building itself takes on a lot more wear &amp; tear, and they put a burden on staff as they think the building porter&amp;doorman are there for them like a hotel concierge and front desk."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"If only there was some regulation for such services that would require some sort of standard. You know some sort of licensing by the state. /sThis is what you get when you skirt laws, artificially lowering prices to kill competition and exploit workers. Stop complaining, it&#39;s your own doing for supporting this type of economy. Only because maybe some of those existing laws were cumbersome or outdated doesn&#39;t mean you just go around all of them."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I’m a programmer with MS.  Like you, diagnosed about 15 years ago, but still doing pretty well.  I feel like I’m starting to notice the gradual decline more and more, despite not having had a serious clinical relapse for about 10 years (some minor ones).Things you can try:
Changing your drugs - maybe going for something drastic like HSCT.Being patient and not panicking - if you’re currently having flare ups your symptoms will appear worse than they really are while there’s acute inflammation happening.  Don’t forget that.  If the flare ups get under control you’ll should see some recovery and improvement.Not giving up - keep pushing yourself as hard as you can, make sure you’re training whatever’s left of your central nervous capacity.  There’s probably still some left.  Keep trying to do as much as you can and you’ll get access to it."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Also had it for 15 years, I was sharper in my 20s than now but now and I think age and MS have affected that. I realise I&#39;m at my best when not stressed, well rested and happy. However I&#39;m not always in control of those. Stress is easier to deal with as I talk to my employers about my condition and I avoid anything stressful when possible. I still feel useless some days and have bad brain fog and can&#39;t think clearly, it gives me a lot of imposter syndrome.Im currently moving somewhere else to get better rest. And my happiness is in progress, I tried anti depressants but I get anxiety and I tried CBT but it didn&#39;t work either. I do also swim regularly which helps too but still not enough. Im hoping this move will help. However its gone on for so many years that I think I will seek a professional soon.Covid and the pandemic definitely affected me, I couldn&#39;t walk properly for weeks after recovering from it. I used to do 20min walk every day to recover and just to keep active and get out. My depression got worse (was getting CBT in days before lockdown) but a few friends of mine play regularly online so I got to be social at least and talk about it. To add to this, I also quit my job before lockdown to travel so I was unemployed for a year in pandemic. I remember going to cafes when things partially opened to practise interview questions and did little projects. I finally got a job the next year.I&#39;m still worried I won&#39;t be strong enough to travel one day, my max distance walking is 1.5km, give or take, without a rest, I could go a lot further only a few years ago.I know MS affects everyone differently and it can be a very hidden condition. My life could of been quite different without it but it could have been worse. Im lucky to have found a job coding and the silver lining of the pandemic is wfh. I see it like you have to play with the cards your dealt and whatever you can change for the better then try to. It&#39;s not been an easy road till now but I try and remain hopeful for the future.I know it must be even harder considering your circumstances and your health. I hope this helps to know your not alone at least."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"That sounds incredibly tough.My brother has a similar/worse sickness that halves his life expectancy. He&#39;s also a programmer. Some quick thoughts from going through the downs with him:- There&#39;s no silver bullet. More sleep, better nutrition, more sports, and less stress make a difference.- My brother literally left a PhD in treatment optimization using ML at Cambridge because pharmaceutical companies are churning such better treatment so fast that optimization past ones felt irrelevant. The bad news is that most new treatments only stabilize your situation, so you have to stay as healthy as you can until the cure comes. We felt it was better to plan around this, and open the door to be positively surprised, than hope for the moon and get crushed with never ending disappointment.- There are many ways of earning a living that don&#39;t involve programming. Career switches can be daunting when you&#39;ve lost self confidence, but most jobs require only a fraction of the brain it takes to program.- If the prospects are very gloomy, consider changing country. We had my brother move country so he could get a medication that&#39;s not covered at home and costs &gt;$250k/year. The medication changed his life, and will soon be covered at home too. Having to leave your friends for health reasons suck, but European countries offer such better health coverage that it can be worth it. And it&#39;s easier living a happy life when you don&#39;t have to worry about unpredictably becoming homeless."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I made that image![1]. And this is not the first time it&#39;s been on the front page of HN either[2]. So I&#39;d like to share some context that I&#39;ve not mentioned elsewhere before.My father died from alcoholism in 2004. He made his living writing software (hence why I do too, and why I enjoy HN). But he also, for a short time, taught Astronomy evening classes. I&#39;ve always felt short-changed by the emotional absence and traumatic passing of my male parent. But the continued virality of this image has been some sort of magical glimmer from the depths of the universe that it was still his shoulders that I stood on in order to reach where I am today. Maybe it was the glint in his eyes every time he showed me the latest APOD image[3], and the deep love with which he would explain their contexts. I made this composite image of Andromeda and the moon precisely because of that extra commentary, or rather I should say, extra love, of the night sky that my father gave me. Seeing it here, sparkling in the &#34;night sky&#34; of the HN front page stirs the same kind of wonder I sometimes feel catching those million year old specks of light above my head. Reminding me that though the universe is mostly cold and dark that doesn&#39;t diminish its warmth and brightness.1. https://www.reddit.com/r/spaceporn/comments/1u0dxs/andromeda...2. https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=229923843. https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/astropix.html"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This (or some sort of very similar comparison) prompted me to figure out how to locate Andromeda. And I could not see anything, So I bought a nice pair of binoculars, and perhaps I could see something, but it was impossible to tell for sure. until I went camping in Arizona, I was looking at the stars, I remembered how to find Andromeda, remembered my binoculars. everything had came together and there it was! it looked like a blue mist.But really it was a nearly spiritual experience. Out in the cold Arizona desert, more stars than I have ever seen in my life and you bring up a pair of binoculars to what looks like an empty area of sky and it too is full of stars, And there is this blue mist, the furthest thing you can see with the naked eye(at least with better eyes than mine) with billions and billions of stars contained within. I don&#39;t know, but you feel stuff under those circumstances."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"It may be obvious and this may be a bit pedantic, but the “actual size” and “size compared to the moon” part is confusing, as comparing the size of two objects is usually comparing two objects at the same scale.If someone was completely clueless, they would think Andromeda is a teeny tiny galaxy. But it’s actually 110,000 light years wide — quite a bit bigger than the moon. :)The title show just be something along the lines of “Andromeda in the sky if it were brighter, next to the moon”. Or just “Andromeda if it were brighter”.I say this because I’ve seen other “X compared to Y” articles on HN (one compared planets and the sun to the moon, where the moon was a pixel), and these are all at-scale comparisons. So I was expecting something similar here from the title."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Here&#39;s why interrupt is inherently more efficient: as long as both participants are willing to yield to interrupt-denies and counter-interrupts when interrupting, you have shifted the communication mode from:A) Anticipate up front what other person needs to hear and say it allB) Rapid adjustment to ideal info requirements as your model of their knowledge/interest is live-updated.But the trick people seem to miss is that interrupt-denies and counter-interrupts make the whole thing possible.When I&#39;m talking with someone for whom this style is natural, there can be many very rapid small gestures to interrupt, which sometimes are accepted and sometimes are rejected by a small &#34;just let me keep going, you&#39;ll see why&#34; gesture. Each of those gestures takes a fraction of a second (and generally does not actually break flow of speech, just eye contact + a little head motion), and conversations employing them are far more enjoyable because information flow is near optimal.On the other hand, when speaking with anti-interrupt people, I often get so bored it&#39;s hard to pay attention because either 1) they left something out that I wanted to ask about so I can&#39;t follow what they are saying, or 2) I already had a thorough understanding of something they insist on giving a long explanation of."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I have a strong habit of &#34;autocompleting&#34; people&#39;s thoughts in my head before they&#39;re done saying them. I&#39;m only right maybe ~60% of the time, but it comes with a strong urge to interrupt them and let them know where I think they&#39;re going. This is especially true if I can tell that it will take them multiple sentences to finish their thought. It does not come from a place of &#34;you&#39;re wasting my time, I get it, jeez&#34;, but more from a &#34;I understand the point you&#39;re making and I am eager to hear the next thing you have to share.&#34;What I&#39;ve noticed is that my habit of interruption is received wildly differently by different kinds of people. It drives some people absolutely crazy, and in these settings I&#39;ve learned to be a little more mindful and try to restrain myself from interjecting so frequently. However, for other people, it works wonderfully and we&#39;ll get into a really fast-moving conversation where less redundant information is shared.My theory is that two well-intentioned interrupters can have a pleasant conversation, and two well-intentioned waiters can have a pleasant conversation, but any pairing of an interrupter and a waiter will be disastrous unless both are very mindful of how they participate in the conversation."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;m surprised no one here has mentioned the power dynamics of interruption.  It is well known in psychology that interrupting anothers speech is a way to exert power.  The boss can interrupt anyone, no one interrupts the boss.  It&#39;s one of several types of interruption:https://www.psychmechanics.com/psychology-of-interrupting/Interrupting someone can say &#34;I am more important than you&#34;.  This can also cause failures to communicate since the boss can change the subject and the interrupted speaker may never get to finish their thought.  I&#39;ve seen projects fail because a boss intentionally interrupted people who were trending in a direction they did not want to go, squashing anyone who was pointing out a major flaw in the bosses plans, which resulted in building things in a bad way and then having the flaw manifest and cause the project to fail.There are other types of interruption though that can be more supportive or more like parallel conversations.  The efficiency of those often depends on the quality of the participants memory and ability to follow multiple threads simultaneously."</p>

People will login if they decide to star the project, but they might never get to your GitHub if they don’t have time to login or can’t easily login on the device where they’re reading."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; Last time I posted this it didn&#39;t garner much interest.Looks good.  I use Postman daily and it sucks, so always open to alternatives.I don&#39;t recall what it looked like the last time you posted, but I wonder if part of the low interest is because upon arrival it doesn&#39;t instantly jump out to the visitor that this is something you can host/run locally.
It&#39;s very easy to miss the Github links top right.  And if you don&#39;t realise that, then what you see is a third party website expecting you to send your development requests through their UI, which is off-putting.As I say, I don&#39;t remember, but that may be why I skipped it last time.  I&#39;ll pay more attention this time!(Edit: split paragraphs for clarity)"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Always the same story. To me, it reads something like this:&gt; Child sexual abuse often happens in bathrooms. Therefore, all bathrooms should have cameras. The video feeds should be stored and analyzed for illegal behavior, and law enforcement should have access, ideally in real time and without a court order. The risk of leaks, hacking, or abuse by law enforcement or system administrators is negligible, so citizens need not worry.Historically, law enforcement has been chronically understaffed and generally ineffective enforcing these heinous crimes. Even credible and actionable reports that could lead to arrests often end up on a pile. When this system is deployed, the amount of flagged behavior will be 100x more than the reports of today, most of which will be false positives. This is ultimately what makes it obvious that these are bad faith arguments, and that the ulterior motive is good old mass surveillance."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is pretty impressive!I play piano accordion (but not particularly well). I started watching the video first and was a little troubled that the bellows appeared to be home-made, crappy looking, and not nearly as effective as they could be. Aftermarket bellows are not hard to find and are not even that expensive if you get them from China. But then I saw that he made them out of _floppy disks_ and decided that was pure genius.This also made me realize that a computer keyboard pretty closely resembles the right hand of a chromatic button accordion, so I assume that&#39;s how it&#39;s laid out.Anyway, he certainly plays this cobbled-together instrument far better than I&#39;ll ever play my analog accordion. There are MIDI and other &#34;digital&#34; accordions out there but they are either extremely expensive or limiting in terms of what you can do with them, or both. This gives me hope that one day I could possibly build my own programmable digital accordion."</p>

My server would receive millions of requests, weird reflection attacks like [1], probes, the whole nine, it made the dashboarding useless for personal tracking.But now my pi-hole only listens on my LAN network and its tailnet address, and any machine connected to the tailnet including my phone will use the pi-hole without configuration on any network via MagicDNS.[1]: https://www.linuxquestions.org/questions/linux-newbie-8/ther..."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I think you&#39;re forgetting the main reason: the group of people using it to communicate is really small and shrinking every year.The only large group of people who still primarily use SMS to communicate person-to-person is Android users in the USA.Every other country has settled on either Telegram, WeChat, WhatsApp or FB Messenger, or other niche apps. These apps work on both iOS and Android and often also Windows. I haven&#39;t sent an SMS in probably 12 years. I don&#39;t know anyone who has.It&#39;s only in the US that iMessage is so prevalent that Android users have to use SMS, the only other way of messaging iOS devices. And the US is quickly becoming a de-facto iOS only country. It already has more than 50% market share, even 80% among young people.With the US going (almost) full iMessage and the rest of the world having already settled on another app there simply no point to supporting SMS."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"SMS was, in my opinion, the killer feature for Signal. Telling people to install yet-another-inbox which was only going to be used by their one privacy-weirdo friend was a non-starter.Saying &#34;this is a better SMS app&#34; got people on-board and let them &#34;upgrade&#34; to secure messaging.  That&#39;s why I started using it in the &#34;TextSecure&#34; days.But, sadly, I agree with Signal&#39;s reasoning here. Mixing the two protocols was annoyingly complex. If someone stopped using Signal, messages you sent to them would never arrive - with no notification.  And there&#39;s no obvious way to &#34;downgrade&#34; to SMS.I was working on RCS a decade ago. I&#39;m glad to see it is finally getting somewhere - but I&#39;m sad it is at the expense of better and more secure protocols."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I once spend several euros sms-ing instead of what I thought was Signal-ing with someone in another country. Since then I keep the two strictly in 2 different apps.I certainly wont mourn for this. Sms gets super expensive to other countries (outside the EU), it also gets super expensive when you don&#39;t pre-pay for a bundle (it&#39;s 2 eur for 1000 messages, then 25ct per message after that, ridiculous). Imho dutch carriers did everything they could to kill sms, and now I&#39;m happy for it. The only bad thing is that my society at large seems to have chosen Whatsapp as it&#39;s replacement..."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; That same day, while the stock market remained lofty, Dr. Auchincloss reported selling $15,001 to $50,000 of a stock mutual fund. Days later he sold two more mutual funds and a stock&gt; Dr. Auchincloss disclosed six sales of mutual funds that day, totaling between $111,006 and $315,000 in value.And&gt; The rate cuts hadn’t immediately calmed investors. Stock trading was halted for 15 minutes on the morning of March 16 when the S&amp;P 500 fell 7%, triggering a so-called circuit breaker. The index staggered to the closing bell, down 12%.&gt; That same day, Ms. Chao, the transportation secretary, made three purchases in stock funds that track the S&amp;P 500 and the U.S. stock market broadly, totaling between $600,003 and $1.2 million, according to her financial disclosures.Every time I click on one of these articles, I expect to find some individual stock trading related to specific companies on the receiving end of government action. However, when it ends up being vague examples of officials buying and selling broad-market or S&amp;P index funds, it&#39;s much harder to see where the &#34;insider trading&#34; angle comes from. Especially when we have examples of officials trading in March, a full month after the viral panic had already spread through even public forums like Twitter.The line needs to be drawn somewhere, and I&#39;m not convinced that forbidding public officials from buying and selling generic index and mutual funds is really that big of a concern, IMO.Now if someone can find evidence of government officials buying something like Moderna stock ahead of the FDA approval, then by all means let&#39;s prosecute with stiff consequences."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"This might sound crazy... but if the UK is already de facto ruled by financial markets, in the sense that the PM has to step down if the markets don&#39;t like what they&#39;re doing, maybe it&#39;s time to try prediction market-based governance for real?What would&#39;ve happened if instead of simply announcing the proposal, Truss had described the proposal and the government had sponsored a conditional prediction market on the economic effects?She could&#39;ve run prediction markets for dozens of proposals, and selected a policy that was popular with both the markets and the public.(Lest this idea be seen as overly capitalist: there&#39;s no reason not to run a prediction market for &#34;degree to which this policy will reduce inequality&#34;, and incorporate the result into decisionmaking as well.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This is a great trick and with practice you don&#39;t even need a watch, heck you don&#39;t even need an object to cast a shadow.The sun is over there, a shadow would be that way, it&#39;s about 5 o&#39;clock. That must be north!What I&#39;ve always thought of as witchcraft is this.Jab a stick in the ground, mark the end of the shadow. Come back some time later say 15-30mins. Mark the new end of the shadow.Draw a line between marks and that is an east-west line!In the Northern hemisphere the stick is south of that line, in the southern hemisphere it&#39;s North!What!!"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"From some of the comments, I’m not sure people fully get this. It’s basically doing a geometric construction of the sun’s path across the sky, using the distance between the hour hand and the 12 on the watch face as one of the input angles in the calculation. That’s quick (important because you have to repeat it while you’re marching) and easy to remember (also important because you might need it in a situation without access to Wikipedia). Under the assumption that the sun rises at 06:00 in the exact East and sets at 18:00 in the exact West, the construction is almost perfect. Of course, that’s never exactly true in real life, but still a lot more accurate than “well I know the sun is roughly South”."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I love this trick. You can also do this using your hands if you know roughly what time it is.For example, if it&#39;s sunny out, place your arm in your shadow, parallel to the ground. Keep it there. This arm represents the current time (say, 10 O&#39;clock).
Look at your shadow and point your other arm out, parallel to the ground, and adjust it until the arm&#39;s shadow points at &#34;12 O&#39;clock&#34; relative to your first arm (in your shadow).
Clap your hands together, and you&#39;re pointing north!"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I kinda sorta see google’s side. 
There are just too many shady operators out there who will swear blind they’re completely honest, and maybe they are, but they also employed a third party to write code or maybe just imported a 3rd party lib (i am in no way saying this is the case)As to, why don’t they look at the code? bugger that being standard practise, i’m not handing over my code to google or apple.Even if they did, how to check final the uploaded binary?I’m not doubting the article, but the mobile app world is flooded with shady operators at all levels, and i don’t really buy the real paranoid arguments here"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Of course Google isn&#39;t going to look at the code. Most Google App Store apps are not open source, so why would that be a workflow at all?You have to evaluate those same deliverables that are downloaded to the user.To be able to infer properties of the build application from the source code review, it has to be shown that the two correspond; the shipped, built version comes from the code that was reviewed.Poring over someone&#39;s source code is a fool&#39;s errand. You will never catch everything; people find 25 year old bugs in code that have evaded all previous pairs of eyes.Google&#39;s approach here is poor though; they created these API&#39;s and permission model and now have to backpedal on it randomly.If you want untrusted applications to have access to Contacts, it should be done with abstract tokens that do not reveal any contact details. Each contact is represented by an object handle that provides every imaginable operation you might want to do to, with or by-means-of a contact.It&#39;s possible to design a system whereby some contact properties (e.g. mobilePhoneNumber) are accessible, but the result of the access is an abstract object that doesn&#39;t actually reveal the content, only represents its existence.  The user interface could be priviled so that, say, a text field widget can be given one of these opaque objects, and then display the actual phone number. The only way to get at it would be to have permission to take a screenshot, and then OCR it."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;m not familiar with mobile app review process, would any change in code require a re-review/re-submit? If Google approved it as-is, could the developers add a few lines as an &#34;update&#34; and skip over the full review process?Seems like the ruling is being made on what can be done with the current permissions, rather than what is being done. If that&#39;s the case, I sympathize with the devs but I think I support the position Google is taking there.Off-topic comment: I use NoScript, and the entire text of the article renders for a half second before disappearing and for some inexplicable reason requiring JS to be enabled. If you can render it for that half second, why hide it? Why force me to use JS when you just proved that you can render it without?"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"We have been using KillBill for many years for our SaaS product.While it is very nice to own our data, we have had a huge lot of issues with it too.Beware that this is an &#34;industrial&#34; tool, meaning that it is very complex, written in Java, with a lot of quirks and sharp edges. The core team also seems to mainly  work on some closed-source version of it, for some not-very-clear-what big corp(s). They let you know sometimes that there exists a more feature-full closed-source version when asking questions in the support google group or on github issues, but it&#39;s not very transparent.If you are a startup with a small team or small budget and no real Java development skills, you&#39;ll probably want to be careful in considering to use it: many custom things you&#39;ll want to do will require contracting with one of their partners because it&#39;s too complicated to do yourself, and support will be limited, and debugging issues will be hugely complicated if you are not used to that tech stack...Just this week, we have had a major issue with it: after doing an `apt upgrade`, docker was updated and restarted. It restarted KillBill&#39;s docker images fine but KillBill itself restarted only the Stripe plugin, not the Avatax one, for an unknown reason. So the tool happily generated invoices and payments for a few hours without any taxes (!), until we noticed and started the plugin manually from the interface. This is the kind of issues we regularly have to deal with, and while the tool does a good job most of the time, it is mindblowingly annoying sometimes."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; Does Kill Bill support taxes?&gt; Kill Bill does not support taxes. Instead, we partner with Avalara to outsource tax compliance. Our AvaTax connector provides real-time and on-demand calculationsto prevent overcharging or undercharging tax.I expected as much. Handling taxes internationally is a major PITA and it changes all the time as politicians get new ideas how to make things even more complicated. I&#39;m pretty sure that many SaaS companies are unknowingly not compliant with all the rules."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Met with this team probably 8 years ago for consideration on a (at the time) large subscription product. Didn&#39;t go with it because of issues in the organization I was working with,  but KillBill folks were good people, impressive, good product. Glad to see them still around."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This is &#34;only&#34; two of the seven modules included in the desktop version, but even just one would be a breakthrough on the iPad.The full DaVinci Resolve is nuts: it covers a complete, Hollywood-level workflow of DAM, editing, grading, sound, and VFX (with probably the most generous freemium model in existence, by a good margin). The iPad version covers one of the two edit workflows (the one more tailored to broadcast than film) and color grading, which will cover quite a few use cases without anything else. I can especially see this being used by serious YouTubers and independent content creators.I wonder if the asset management module is planned, as that would seem to be the next-most broadly useful module."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is incredible on so many fronts. 5-10 years ago, I would choose my computer based on it&#39;s potential to edit video. A decade ago, most laptops couldn&#39;t handle the load of uncompressed video. 5 years ago, having iMovie on your Ipad allowed us to make sub &lt;5 minute videos of low-res/processed files. Now we have an intersection of 1. an Ipad is powerful enough to handle this type of data processing and 2. BMD has found ways of dealing with the huge file sizes and rendering / editing in real time. Unreal. I imagined this would come some day but not today."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I’ve long held this opinion but I consistently get drowned out.DevOps has different meaning depending on who you’re talking to, even some definitions that appear similar are different in nuanced but important ways.All “devops” as a job title has done has muddy responsibilities and given many folks the wrong impression of what an operations discipline should be.There is also a lot of rewriting of history that gets thrown in, similar to how when people talk about cloud then the only alternative is to start making CPUs by hand and begin building your own nuclear reactors. It’s the idea of what came before, not the reality, that people seem to be defensive of.It’s honestly exhausting to discuss.So instead I became CTO so I can solve this mess properly, I don’t hire devops, I hire infra engineers, build engineers, release engineers and: backend engineers.Roles so simple that you already have a clue what they do, which is sort of the point of job titles."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I have bewilderingly tried to discern why software development continues to grow more and more complex.It wasn’t always like this. There was a time when we talked about languages and OSes and libraries as if they made a difference on how much you could get done with as little people and cognitive load as possible (the claims were very much overrated, but the point was we acted like it mattered).And then it started ballooning. It seems to me that much of that coincides with a lot of new money being dumped into the economy, and software moving past the necessary-evil-so-how-do-I-drive-down-my-costs and on to the gold rush of you must have a web app for your service that rivals a video game in complexity and visual finesse. It seems to me that as long as their is so much free money sloshing around venture capital funding, that it was inevitable that the process of making software would complexify to soak up the extra cash. After all, you can only add so many levels and varieties of managers to add value. After that comes the variegation in roles of software development.That’s my working theory anyway."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This echoes the philosophy of Google Site Reliability Engineering, which (this is key) is an engineering discipline.The job of DevOps is not to close tickets. That&#39;d be like driving a car by shouting directions at someone lying on the floorboards holding a wrench to the steering pinion.The job of DevOps is to build a steering wheel (and ideally, teach SWEs how to drive... at least enough that they understand what a &#34;road&#34; is and why it&#39;s a pleasant experience for everyone if you stay on it. If the road doesn&#39;t go where they need to be, then it&#39;s time to file a ticket, but that ticket had better be &#34;Build a new road,&#34; not &#34;Offroad this one car to the cabin in the woods and call it a job well done&#34;).The raw hardware of an enterprise deployment is so flexible it solves nobody&#39;s problem. DevOps is in the business of writing the operating system for a mega-computer physically represented by hundreds to possibly millions of heterogeneous computers. It&#39;s a process of continuous growth to make that work."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Using the web and it&#39;s services really feels more and more like tedious work which is simply not worth it anymore. I don&#39;t want to sound like some old grunt (not even 30 yet), but every modern service uses some kind of automatic banning system and everything you invested can be gone in seconds.To spice things up, all these services also stopped providing any kind of support regarding these kind of problems. Ever tried to get into contact with anybody about a banned account?Just some weeks ago Discord decided to ban my 6 year old account out of nowhere. I didn&#39;t used Discord for 4 weeks, since I was on vacation. Also I am pretty sure, that it wasn&#39;t hacked, because I used MFA and no other account was affected.I tried to contact the support, but only got a template response, that they don&#39;t talk about reasons and my account data will also be deleted in 14 days. I tried to contact them again, but they simply blocked my mail after that.I didn&#39;t do any suspicious on discord ever. So I really had no clue why this happened. While talking with friends and coworker I&#39;ve heard similar stories. And everybody of us changed their hardware multiple times beforehand (for example to test a specific component or for overclocking). Gotta love automatic banning systems..."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I worked for a large grocery store chain between 2004 and 2010, there the AI had already taken over. Though we didn&#39;t call it an AI, just &#39;the system&#39;.The system was able to procure goods with stunning accuracy. Sometimes it even surprised us. For example: we&#39;d receive a much higher number of BBQ meat than typical, only to realise it was going to be amazing weather the coming days.The system was also making schedules for the re-stocking team with the same accuracy. It knew what it ordered, the exact time the truck was due to arrive, at which time the personnel was available (not at school, for example), etc. The system told us when to show up, and when we had to be finished.The system was even able to pinpoint cashiers that were stealing money from the register, by correlating cash count of the individual registers to the schedule (which the AI also created). It would then &#39;isolate&#39; the suspected employee to a single register and order a cash count (which was done by hand) at the end of the day.Basically the only reason why there still was a manager was for responsibility and babysitting (most employees were teens that did dumb stuff). And the occasional Karen who wanted to talk to a manager.I remember being being thoroughly impressed with the efficiency of the software back then. In some ways it must have influenced my career path (I now work in automating businesses). I left in 2010, I can only imagine how much more advanced this system has become since."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I think this article fundamentally misunderstands the core function of middle management. You can boil it down to 2 key tasks (on the front lines of a very large organization).a) Interpreting: either top-&gt;down by explaining and enforcing corporate policy on hourly workers or bottom-&gt;up by ensuring workers enter data to be reported on correctlyb) &#34;Encouraging&#34;: an employee calls in sick, again. Neither firing them or giving them the day off every time are desirable. The managers role is to &#34;encourage&#34; the performance and attendance (in one way or another)Neither of these are low hanging fruit for automation or even middle hanging fruit for automation.edit: I would also add that the comment &#34;Union formation across the retail landscape will force corporations to reduce management head count&#34; is backwards. From a management perspective, if labor gets rowdy you need more overseers to keep them in line. More union activity = more management headcount"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is a poorly reasoned or at least a poorly articulated essay. AI to this point is built to optimize some objective function. What is that function with respect to middle management? Some sort of mathematical expression would be interesting but even a plain-English expression would certainly be helpful. And what exactly are the inputs and output? I guess the inputs could be a roster of employees along with some performance metrics, and output is a list of who is kept and who is fired (?). That’s the best I can come up with, but I still think it’s an absurd and impractical eventuality. The article doesn’t even make an attempt to explain.This isn’t some sort of nitpick; AI to this point has not in any way encroached upon personnel management to my knowledge and a prediction in that direction ought to elucidate exactly how that could be expected to work. Managing workers involves empathy and understanding human emotions generally and I’ve seen no indication that AI has made advances into this space recently despite its rapid progress elsewhere."</p>

I did that with the free plan recently in CloudFlare in a similar situation and it worked perfectly (of course on a much smaller scale)."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"If I recall correctly there was some image on wikipedia that was getting billions of downloads a day or something, all from India, because some smart phone had made it a default &#34;hello&#34; image and hot linked it.Unfortunately, I can&#39;t find a reference to it anymore."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I worked on an ad-blocker a few months ago. I made the decision to have the filter-list files hosted on our own domain and CDN (similar to what Adguard  does with their  filters.adtidy.org).This was done for 2 reasons:1- Avoid scenarios like this where you ship code (extension  in this case) that is hard to update. Then make that code depend on external resources outside of your control.2- Leak our users&#39; IP addresses to each random hosting provider.So the solution was simple: Run a CRON once a day then host the files ourselves. Pretty happy with that decision now."</p>

Instagram is not of, and never will be of interest to me.Edit: 2nd suggestion / feature request: add ability to &#39;pin&#39; columns to a position.3rd suggestion / feature request: ability to add scoped google columns, I would love a column that has `site:stackoverflow.com` prefixed to all searches in the 2nd column."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Very smooth!I&#39;d appreciate being able to create custom search profiles (like Brave Goggles).If I&#39;m searching for a famous person, I might want Wikipedia, Goodreads, Twitter, Instagram, [music streaming service(s)], Twitch, and YouTube results.If I&#39;m searching for medicine, I might want Wikipedia, PubChem, MedLinePlus, and Examine.com results.If I&#39;m searching for a question, I might want StackExchange, Reddit, Quora, and Consensus.app results.With my regular searches, I might prefer a different search engine than Google, a different microblogging website than Twitter, etc. Maybe I&#39;m boycotting Instagram and don&#39;t want those results to show at all?What sources does the news tab use? Maybe it&#39;s extremely biased? Let the user decide! Maybe I want different news source profiles (one for serious, less biased sources; one for satire; one for local news; etc.)?What about localization? FASS.se is a popular medical database in Sweden, so I&#39;d like for those results to be displayed in my medical search profile.It would also be cool if the results in the Google column automatically filtered out the results available in the other columns. I mean, since I already have the Wikipedia results in its own column, I don&#39;t need the Google column to hand me a Wikipedia link.I&#39;ll stick to Brave search for now, but it&#39;s a cool tool!"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"It&#39;s very good (will definitely consider moving). Some user feedback:1) Dark Mode please2) Toggleable websites; I saw that the websites I was seeing were black-circles in the panel below the search box. I instinctively tried to click on youtube to not see youtube box. It would also be nice to have a global panel where users can choose if they never want to see a certain website.But these^ are just me being super picky. Overall, a great UX."</p>

Yeah, we all make mistakes, sorry Firefox.Anyway, Brave seems like a great option to keep extensions alive that can actually block ads/trackers. Chrome is about to can that ability.More info here for the uninformed: https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2021/12/chrome-users-beware-ma..."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Here&#39;s my story with Brave. I am obsessed with browser interfaces, and have tried them all - Safari, Chrome, Vivaldi, Orion, Arc, Firefox. Because of my specific use cases, I always returned to Chrome.Brave initially turned me off - I did not care about Rewards and Wallet. However, after turning them off, I found that it&#39;s basically Chrome (e.g. Figma works fine, unlike Webkit-based browsers), but de-Googled and with ad blocking natively implemented.I also liked squared tabs more!Also, here&#39;s my custom icon for Brave:https://filerun.vlad.studio/wl/?id=GzgLxysYndDu4jW73RunWCYEV...https://www.figma.com/file/vgSnbD1pIzI7AOEbWddiLO/Brave-Mac-..."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"As I understand it, the reason Feynman diagrams in quantum electrodynamics (where the primary entities are electrons and photons) can be used to calculate properties very accurately is that the electromagnetic coupling constant (1/137) results in the higher-order terms in a series eventually vanishing away to nothing, while with the strong force the coupling constant is &gt;= 1, so the higher-order terms have to be included, leading to things like infinities (or at the very least, ratios of very large quantities with correspondingly large uncertainties).The strong force is a bit confusing, as it binds boths quarks with the proton and neutron, as well as binding the neutrons and protons into atomic nuclei, over short ranges (accounting for the upper size limit / stability limit of the largest nuclei).  Mesons are the force-carrying entity that bind the neutrons and protons together, but gluons are the force-carrying entity that bind the quarks together, as per this wiki article:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strong_interactionIs it the case that theoretical strong-force calculations have just hit a dead-end and there&#39;s no way out in sight, due to the coupling constant issue?"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I don&#39;t disagree with any points but they missed a big one.  If at all possible, include some application (or attempt at a globally) unique error code on each of your errors - i.e. YCOM-HN-9021.  When you provide a clearly googleable string you can help your users independently resolve the issue and you can also set up google alerts on the string - if you roll out a new feature that took 3 months to develop and a week later google tells you that YCOM-HN-9021 is up 9000% you probably broke something.  If at all possible make yourself open to client communication but most users won&#39;t reach out about an error - users have very low trust in customer care in the modern world (and it is, honestly, often more trouble than it&#39;s worth) and are more likely to turn to reddit/technical forums for a solution.  It is extremely advantageous to try and track these users."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;ll add a few for developer-oriented messages.* Say what the program was trying to do.* Make the message unique and searchable.* Make it detailed.* FFS, include the filename or whatever else the program is having trouble with.* If possible, include the source code location.* If possible, include useful contextual information.* Quote strings. Once in a while, some unexpected whitespace sneaks in somewhere and this can be hard to figure out.Eg, don&#39;t just abort with &#34;Open failed: NOT_FOUND&#34;. Abort with &#34;job.c:2105 Failed to open job description file &#39;/var/spool/jobs/125.json&#39; when processing job #5 for user &#39;alice&#39;: NOT_FOUND&#34;.This way I don&#39;t have to strace the damn thing to try and figure out what&#39;s it looking for, and know which user it was for, so I don&#39;t have to dig around and try and figure out which entry in the database might contain the wrong information.Also, context-free, generic error messages are awful. A large enough codebase may be impossible to search for some very common keywords.If possible, googleable error codes are great to have, but they shouldn&#39;t replace the error message.  It&#39;s ideal if you can search the source code and instantly find where the error message originates."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"At a previous job, writing unambiguous error messages was discouraged. Everything just had to be &#34;Oops! Something went wrong&#34;The reasoning was that &#34;users can&#39;t do anything with information we tell them anyways&#34;, despite the overwhelming number of help desk tickets we&#39;d get from &#34;Oops!&#34; appearing in a million different scenarios with no clear way for us to tell what error actually caused the message to appear.Users naturally report the messages that they see because they&#39;re helping us to see the problem. I didn&#39;t get why that was such a hard concept to understand"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"When the iPhone launched, Apple talked a lot about how the typing system worked.What I remember is that it sounded like pretty simple lookups. As you typed, the software compared your word to, essentially, a weighted dictionary to guess what you were going to type next.If you typed “b” it was flummoxed. But if you typed “behav” it knew the next letter was almost certainly going to be “e” or “i” (for behavior). It may have been more complicated than that, but probably not much. It was 2007 and the phone CPU was not powerful.One interesting thing I remember is that they said the phone enlarged the touch targets for highly predicted next letters. For example it would be easier to type an “e” than a “w” after you had typed “behav”, because the tap boundary expanded around the “e”. Cool stuff!And if you did type behavw and hit space, it would autocorrect to behave.At some point I recall Apple announcing that they had switched autocorrect to a full machine learning implementation. Rather than a simple deterministic look-up, it was trained on a huge corpus of text, and reads the whole chunk of what you’ve written so far to make predictions. Everyone does this now, it’s how they deliver the (incredibly annoying and stupid IMO) one-tap suggestions for email and text replies. “Thanks!” “Noted.” “I’ll get right on that.”In my memory, that’s when typing got a lot more annoying on iPhones. The quality of suggestions went either down or weirdo or both. For example it just tried to sub-in “Quaker” for “quality” in the previous sentence. Why??"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Wow, thank you for posting this, I was just thinking this!Most people here focus on autocorrect, which isn&#39;t such a big problem for me since I&#39;m used to having it off.But what the hell is wrong with the cursor placement? It is so incredibly broken, it has a mind of its own, and never goes to where I mean to put it.Simply tapping on text puts it in the wrong places, but holding and dragging cursor or holding and dragging on the spacebar to move it also works terribly, somehow it never does what I need it to.Selecting text is just as terrible.It&#39;s also impossible to put the cursor in the middle of a word. WHY NOT? Just put the cursor where I tap! It is so easy to do on Android.I find it much easier to type and move cursor on my Galaxy S9 than on my iPad mini, despite the iPad having a much bigger screen."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;ve been using iPhone &gt;10 years and cannot agree more. One example: from iOS 7 (that flat UI), I began to make much more frequent typos than ever before. Before that, I didn&#39;t make much typo before the update even without looking at the keyboard but not anymore after the update. What I heard is that Apple did extensive studies on usability of virtual keyboard when it&#39;s launching iPhone and as a result keyboard visual on the screen was intentionally off from the actual layout based on actual typing patterns. And for some reason it seems they scrapped that idea, or at least changed it significantly. Don&#39;t know why. Maybe I&#39;m an outlier and everyone else is happier with the change.But this is just one example; almost every 2~3 years, I&#39;ve experienced a noticeable level of degradation of my typing accuracy, though not as much as the iOS 7 change. I wonder if there&#39;s anyone else whose experience matches to mine."</p>

As inconsequential as it may seem, the positioning of antennas above the plane are a bit metaphoric for flipping things up side down. Looking out into space instead of back to earth.Also notable that SpaceX keeps finding these cool (revenue generating) use cases to further cheapen the cost of sending things up to space.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This advice is going to be hated by a lot of people but.. care less.You’re in an industry that values your skills and seems to always have demand. Whether or not that’s true in the future, it certainly is today, so the best thing you can do is put yourself first and worry less about work
as a whole. Especially if it’s not your own company.Spend more time on you, on activities with friends and family, on hobbies. If you don’t have particularly healthy hobbies, maybe start some.  Getting away from your work more and more will make it all the more bearable.These days work is close to the bottom of my list of concerns, which sounds really bad - BUT - I find I’m more productive than I’ve been in years because I’m not worrying if something takes longer than expected or is bigger than I realised. I can just enjoy the problem solving and shipping without the stress.If you’re burned out this badly I’d suggest it’s your soul’s way of telling yourself “hey this isn’t working for me”. As someone who has been to some pretty messed up depths with the anxiety monster, I’d heed that voice. Life isn’t long enough to stay stuck in a rut like this for any amount of time at all."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I found that just moving teams and dropping a load of baggage made a huge difference and a huge improvement.I also found that regular physical exercise outside (running for me) is a game changer and totally allows your brain to disconnect.Finally, don&#39;t guilt trip yourself on your free time.  There is nothing you &#34;should&#34; be doing on your spare time.  Want to code?  Fine.  But do you really?  Want to just veg out and watch Netflix?  Also fine.  Want to do some &#34;junk food&#34; gaming?  Do it. Hang out with friends family and loved ones?  I encourage that.

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Can you afford a sabbatical?The term has roots in &#34;seven&#34;, just like Sabbath, so with 14 years in the industry, you&#39;ve skipped one.I think a solid half-year off every seven to ten years is an excellent practice for intellectually demanding labor.What makes it a sabbatical is that it&#39;s a change of pace which furthers your career. I&#39;d love to take a sabbatical and just work on building stuff, personally: from soldering, to designing boards, probing them, writing firmware, I&#39;m a rank amateur, and I&#39;d love to level up for awhile, while free of the burden of justifying my salary in the process.It could be painting, there&#39;s a popular author who wrote a book about the connection between painting and hacking, can&#39;t remember his name but his stuff gets posted here all the time.What it isn&#39;t, is a vacation, or a convalescence. It sounds like you haven&#39;t hit &#34;can&#39;t work&#34;, just &#34;sucks to work&#34;, which is a blessing.If you can&#39;t afford it, that&#39;s understandable, there are ways to get some of the benefit from a new job, but &#34;relieved of the burden of delivering value&#34; is an important factor.I&#39;ve known people who pushed &#34;sucks to work&#34; until it became &#34;can&#39;t work&#34;, and they don&#39;t all make it back to the profession, a bit less than half in fact. Whatever you do, I urge you to take burnout seriously, because at the limit it&#39;s a serious medical condition which can cripple or kill you."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Before the pandemic and surge of remote work, a lot of us complained not just about going to the office, but that the office itself was pretty crappy. The open plan creates an environment of high distraction, low privacy, and physical discomfort. Whether or not people wanted to listen to music or anything for hours at a time, they were pushed to do it just to drown out a constant background noise of words that are highly salient in your problem domain. You&#39;re probably constrained to the desk or chair set up that your office manager picked. The bottom line is you&#39;re spending a lot of time in an environment about which you may have zero input or control.At home, I can work in silence if I want. If I want background noise, I can play music on a stereo or turn on the TV in the next room. When my back hurts, I can lie down on the sofa, or stretch and foam roll in a way which would be conspicuous in the office. I can be barefoot all day if I want. I can snack on the food that I like enough to buy, without broadcasting the pretention of bringing my own food to the micro kitchen. I can eat healthier lunches than the office catered food.  Even without considering commuting, or the amount of time spent in synchronous interactions, just being able to control my own space is sooo much more comfortable. I injured my back this year, and taking care of it has been so much easier at home than it would have been in open plan hell.A bunch of that stuff is nominally compatible with being &#34;in the office&#34; -- just give me a private office, with real walls, the ability to buy my own furniture, etc. But tech long ago decided that engineers get cubicles or open plan desks, that the way you know we&#39;re working is seeing that we&#39;re looking at screens rather than seeing our actual output, that a clean modern spaceship aesthetic is more important than workers being able to control or customize their workspace. Is it that we don&#39;t value the office, or that the office has been created by people who don&#39;t value us?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"If you wonder why an argument might be controversial, it can helpful to imagine how it would sound like in mirror world:Assume for a moment that working remotly and a flexible workday would have been always the default. And now some companies decide: Hey let&#39;s contractually enforce a 9 hour continuous workday where all our workers will be locked in a big ugly building that we build just for that purpose (Btw. at least one of the 9 hours will be unpaid because this is where people will have lunch. Also we won&#39;t reimburse anyone for their traveling expenses or their time spent during the commute).Now read again the arguments you wrote to support this new idea."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; I always saw tech as the field where a disproportionally large amount of people truly love what they do.You do confuse &#34;loving what they do&#34; with &#34;being at the office&#34; and &#34;socializing during slack time&#34;. I do love my job but I do hate socializing with people, which is definitely not my job. That is why I&#39;m working in IT, I don&#39;t have to socialize beyond the bare minimum to be successful. I think IT attracts introverts like me, and I do suspect we are the majority (but I have only anecdata for that).&gt; I know that &#34;the office&#34; is a bad place for a lot of people. [...] But shouldn&#39;t we rather work on fixing those things instead of making them bearable by just turning off a camera in a Zoom meeting?Things have gotten worse and worse around the office. Small one- or few-person offices gave way to cubicles, which gave way to open-plan offices, which gave way to open-plan seat-lottery not-even-your-own-desk offices. No amount of pushback changed this direction in the slightest. Meanwhile noise and interruptions got worse and worse, where in my private office people knocked politely before entering or were kept out by the DND sign, nowadays the seat lottery puts me next to a loudmouthed marketing phone-drone, who when not screaming into the mic drones on about his awesome sales statistics and his new yacht. At least the boss can&#39;t easily walk over anymore and breathe down my neck because the seat lottery put him somewhere else usually. Any and all things that have been tried to fix this are band-aids and lip-service. It only got worse and worse.WFH is great, finally a step in the right direction. I do have no sympathy for the extroverts, because they got us into the aforementioned mess."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"+1 for the recommendation for &#34;The Scientist and Engineer&#39;s Guide to
Digital Signal Processing&#34; by Steven W. Smith. I spoke to Steven many
years ago about his putting all of the book PDFs online for free and
since then have recommended at least 5 university libraries to buy it
because the students could get free copies of a great book that can be
referenced in the library.FWIW the The Scientist and Engineer&#39;s Guide doesn&#39;t actually cover a
lot on sound. It starts in a particular DSP way with frequency domain
definitions and convolution - and I actually think Steven&#39;s background
is in medial imaging, though I could be mistaken."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Instagram&#39;s tagging system was actually really effective at categorizing content and discovery because each hashtag was treated as a node in a (giant) graph, where each node has multiple properties, including post count (number of posts using a tag), &#39;velocity&#39; (number of posts using a particular tag per unit time), etc. I could write up a big post about it as I made a study of it in when I created a web app for finding the most relevant tags a few years ago.All that to say there was a lot to their system and it worked because users became aware that they were rewarded for using the most relevant tags. Using irrelevant tags was punished. This guided users towards using a mix of relevant popular and niche tags to maximize their reach, which, in turn, further improved the tagging system.Instagram&#39;s tagging system isn&#39;t as important anymore as their algorithm has deemphasized it, in favor of other methods for classification and discovery, but there were a couple of golden years where it worked very well. Most users still look back on those years as the &#39;good times&#39; even if they don&#39;t know exactly why. I&#39;d go so far as to say they ruined the app after they deemphasized tags (and added way too many ads)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I adore tagging systems and have worked on them in several different applications and implementations, but there are always pitfalls and trade offs, and it’s possible to bury yourselfNowadays I nearly always store the assigned tags as an integer array column in Postgres, then use the intarray extension to handle the arbitrary boolean expression searches like “((1|2)&amp;(3)&amp;(！5))”. I still have a tags table that stores all the metadata / hierarchy / rules, but for performance I don’t use a join table. This has solved most of my problems. Supertags just expand to OR statements when I generate the expression. Performance has been excellent even with large tables thanks to pg indexing."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I worked with the Wikipedia category system a few years ago, and you could see the problems with hierarchical tagging systems right in action back then. (Though it may have gotten better in the meantime)The system appeared simple: There were just two relations, &#34;Article A is a member of category B&#34; and &#34;Category X is a subcategory of category Y&#34;.However, in practice, the community was using this system to represent a whole host of wildly different relationships between items, often with different implications what a category actually applied to.E.g., if A has a subcategory B, this could mean one of several things: B might be an additional constraint on the items in A (&#34;American writers&#34; -&gt; &#34;19th century American writers&#34;), the things in B might be more specific than the things in A: (&#34;Writers&#34; -&gt; &#34;Novelists&#34;), A might apply to the concept B, not the things in B (&#34;Occupations&#34; -&gt; &#34;Writers&#34;) or A might refer to the category B (&#34;Categories with more than 100 entries&#34; -&gt; &#34;Writers&#34;) and on and on...Of course those different aspects could even be combined. E.g. &#34;Categories with more than 100 entries&#34; might have a child &#34;Categories with more than 100 entries in need of review&#34;, which represents a constraint but might itself contain less than 100 entries...The basic question &#34;Is item X in category Y&#34; becomes impossible to answer generally, because there is no clear indication if a category only applies to its direct children or to all of its descendants or only to the subcategories itself.I&#39;m sure there are sophisticated ontological systems which would allow users to specify all those different relationships separately. I&#39;m also pretty sure that users would become sloppy after a short time or would disagree which particular relationship to use in a particular situation..."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&gt; - Rounding of corners. Religion at this point&gt; - Homogenization. JetBrains wants to be like VSCode&gt; - Animations. Haven&#39;t seen them but it will be filledSeriously, HN? This is the quality that you reward with hundreds of points? Unlike the author, I happen to have used this UI for the past five months and it solves many of my longstanding gripes with IntelliJ:- Gutters are now much better at highlighting local changes, while also being less visually obtrusive.- The shaded tool window background nicely separates them from the editor- Showing the git branch next to the title makes it so much easier to understand where I am, when I work with multiple projects and branches.- Breadcrumbs in the Statusbar save some space and look much cleaner---Also, many of the complaints that I&#39;ve seen in this thread are either wrong or exaggerated:- &#34;Monochrome icons&#34; - Only the toolbar icons are monochrome, everything else still uses coloured icons.- &#34;The toolbar has less icons now&#34; - It&#39;s customisable, you can put whatever you want in there. Yes, with colourful icons.- &#34;More Whitespace&#34; - The vertical space from the top of the screen to the editor is the exact same. The Project view actually looses some vertical space, but only because the font size is bigger (Which you can change obviously). The spacing between the list items is the same according to a designer on Slack.- &#34;This is just some incompetent designer pushing their agenda on us, breaking my workflow because something something trends&#34; - go touch grass.And finally, just to be clear: no, there are no animations - everything is instant."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Eh, I have used vim, spacemacs, sublime, vscode, atom, eclipse and netbeans. Jetbrains IDEs have superior functionality out of the box across languages and don’t require me to mess with and debug a million plugins. I don’t mind a UI refresh, it’s going to be just like the gmail refresh everyone hated it and now we’re all fine with it.I just wish they would invest more money into things that are actually a problem currently like how slow indexing is and how disruptive it is when you do a clean re-install and it indexes all your dependencies again.I have tried spacemacs which gives a lot of functionality out the box with less configuration needed than DIY vim or emacs but it still just doesn’t compare to the ease of use of Jetbrains IDEs across languages (I use Java, Python, Ruby and Typescript every week)."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Seriously! Their slick, compact, and beautifully well laid out UI is one of the primary reasons I use I Intellij Idea.If they force this update, I&#39;ll just not update it. Not to mention, since I now will not be updating it, I can cancel my yearly, recurring subscription too.Hey Jetbrains: You just have to do one thing. And that is: to NOT mess up existing thing.Even if you stop launching new features into your product for next few years, I&#39;ll still happily pay you folks just because your product is so damn perfect as of now.Please don&#39;t ruin it. Forget what VSCode is doing. They are far far far behind you folks. Don&#39;t let THEM ruin your product."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I had a situation once where we had a minor re-org and I ended up with a new manager. Literally day one, he made an attempt to change everyone&#39;s role. We were a team of developers and business analysts. He decided that everyone would become both and spend 50% of their time on each activity. Not sure why he thought this was a good idea, but he did.After he announced it, I had a 1x1 with him and clearly let him know that he was the boss and I&#39;d do my best to accomplish anything he assigned me. I also let him know that the business analyst duties didn&#39;t fit well with my skillset and that I would very likely struggle to produce output. We had a good, honest conversation about the situation and I ended up staying 100% as a developer. In the end he was happy and I was happy.Why am I telling you? It&#39;s that I&#39;ve learned it better to communicate and hopefully work things out then just pack up and head to another place."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Personally I think the concept of growth is a scam to get people to work harder for less. You can certainly grow your skill set, but intelligent people can rise to the occasion in most jobs. Including CEO/Director/High level decision making jobs.Everytime I have received some insultingly low offer from a startup, they start talking about &#34;growth&#34;, &#34;what I can own&#34;, &#34;wearing many hats&#34;. Meanwhile, the founder is sitting on some 40% equity grant."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"There is a leadership book called &#34;First Break all the Rules - What the World&#39;s Greatest Managers Do Differently&#34;.  It&#39;s data driven by a large meta-survey and research project.One of the conclusions was that, essentially, the normal instinct with Performance Management to focus on improving weaknesses is wrong and leads to sub-optimal outcomes.  The best managers actually doubled down on each individuals strengths, and simply accepted weaknesses as something to be smoothed out to the minimally acceptable level. (e.g. someone may not be &#34;good with people&#34;, but they can&#39;t be openly hostile with co-workers.)  Instead the manager would look for another employee which had that weakness as a strength, and manage responsibilities appropriately.It speaks exactly to what was wrong in OP&#39;s experience."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Cool page, though the Halting Problem brings with it a lot of stuff, so using it to prove Godel&#39;s first incompleteness theorem is (imo) a bit like cheating. I&#39;ve proven it before using diagonalization on my blog (but also using concepts like computability for free). At the end of the day, using these ideas, you get the Curry–Howard correspondence for free (which, again, is a bit like cheating).&gt; Gödel’s original proof was slightly strongerTechnically speaking, a lot stronger. Proving Godel&#39;s first incompleteness theorem (don&#39;t even get me started on the second) from first principles is actually much more involved; and certainly more difficult to make it intelligible for non-logicians."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Using the halting problem here shows the consequences of the incompleteness theorem pretty well, but I don&#39;t think it explains it.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"One of the things I have a hard time conveying to non-parents is that the most time-intensive parts of parenting don&#39;t last forever.I&#39;ve talked to a lot of young people who say they don&#39;t want kids because they think their personal lives will permanently halt the moment they have kids. I spend a lot of time trying to explain that:1) I still spend a lot of time with friends and can do most of my personal hobbies/activities on weekends. My wife and I are good at sharing the load. You don&#39;t need 2 parents watching kids 100% of the time.2) The sleepless nights and diaper changes are a mere blip on the scale of a lifetime with kids. You deal with it, then the kids grow up quicker than you think. Don&#39;t let the idea of the first few months/years define your entire decision for how you want to structure your family for the rest of your life.3) You actually like hanging out with your own kids. I talk to a lot of people who are anchored to some negative experience they had 10 years ago babysitting for someone else&#39;s kids, as if that was representative of parenting life. It&#39;s not at all. At the end of the day, I actually rush to finish up my work so I can have more kid time. It&#39;s fun."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"A huge asterisk here is that this varies greatly by culture. For better or worse* certain cultures value strong family bonds and time spent with the parents, as well as bilateral support well into adulthood. Many cultures also encourage multigenerational living within a single household (or in extremely close proximity like my parents did).For example, my parents were happy to have me live at home as long as I wanted, and in fact encouraged me to stay so I could save up. Ideally in their eyes I wouldn&#39;t even move out until I was married. In my parent&#39;s culture, I&#39;m not seen as a loser or a burden because I&#39;m living with them as an adult, only if I wasn&#39;t contributing to the family&#39;s prosperity. Of course I wanted to live my own life sooner than that, but that doesn&#39;t mean I left as soon as I was 18.Because of these strong family ties I live within minutes of my parents, and still make sure to visit often, even if it&#39;s just for dinner.*Where this can breakdown is if one does not fit neatly within the boundaries and expectations set by cultural norms."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"While it may be a true statistic, it seems to dramatically miss the boat. Time spent with a newborn, with an infant, with a four year old, with a ten year old, with a sixteen year old, with a twenty year old are not the same. You can have more interaction, more contentment, more sense of continuity, and more sense of family, in a Thanksgiving weekend spent with your adult child and their family than the entirety of your kid&#39;s first year."</p>

That said:A security reminder to anyone who is in the target audience here: if you&#39;re clever enough to have TOTP 2FA enabled on your Google account, get some cheap USB security keys and enable Advanced Protection, which completely disables non-hardware 2FA.  It requires two different tokens (and you should really get one for each computer you have/use, plus at least one offsite backup) because once enabled it actually and completely locks anyone out of the account that does not possess one of the enrolled tokens.https://landing.google.com/advancedprotection/TOTP is not much better than SMS-based 2FA.  It&#39;s still vulnerable to phishing, local device malware (that attacks your TOTP in your password manager), etc.  It&#39;s best to use hardware tokens everywhere that support them, and both Google and GitHub do.  (And Google supports a special hardware token only mode which I wish more sites would adopt.)"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Here are a few thoughts I haven&#39;t formulated before:It seems clear enough to me that training AIs on copyrighted works is typically or commonly a fair use under existing law, because the AIs can and commonly do learn non-copyrightable elements and aspects of those works. It&#39;s very obvious from enormous numbers of examples that current AI systems are capable of learning much more abstract features of human culture (grammar, concepts, facts, cultural tropes, and many others).A human being doesn&#39;t violate copyright in learning from a copyrighted work, including when that human being is later more able to produce other works based on that learning (e.g. reading fantasy novels and learning concepts, tropes, or vocabulary that one uses to produce other fantasy novels; reading a newspaper and learning facts that one incorporates into an essay; learning artistic techniques or stylistic conventions from studying existing artworks and using them when producing new artworks). Current AI systems are (amazingly) becoming capable of all of these things and may do them in ways that are somewhat akin to how human beings do them. (although I guess Jaron Lanier would object &#34;that&#39;s what they want you to think&#34;)But there are also examples in existing copyright doctrine where people accidentally repeat enough of a prior work to get in trouble for infringement -- most often with song composition (like George Harrison&#39;s &#34;My Sweet Lord&#34;) because relatively small pieces of melody (which a person might easily memorize) may be considered copyrightable.If human beings had much more accurate memories, copyright would be quite a bit more intrusive (and/or quite a bit less effective) because, following any exposure to some kinds of works, we could use our own memories to reproduce those entire works from scratch for our own use or pleasure without obtaining authorized copies from elsewhere.Computers do have such accurate memories, and machine learning systems, which are optimized for things like maximum likelihood estimation, can and do reproduce both copyrightable and non-copyrightable elements of works that they&#39;ve been trained on. After all, the maximum likelihood continuation of a fragment of a text or a song is ... the complete original work. And the ability to reproduce the complete original work would, other things being equal, reduce loss in training. After all, that&#39;s something someone might specifically ask for, and if the system could oblige, it would be doing a better job of providing what the user wanted.It&#39;s relatively foreseeable that machine learning systems would potentially be able to reproduce both copyrightable and non-copyrightable elements of various works, because the distinction between the two isn&#39;t especially clear from an algorithmic or mechanical point of view. (For instance, facts aren&#39;t copyrightable, but the notion of what constitutes a &#34;fact&#34; for this purpose is a culturally-bound legal notion and not at all straightforward to make precise.)But if you had a human author or artist or scholar or programmer who was &#34;trained on&#34; exposure to an enormous body of works, and that person had an exceptional eidetic memory, you could imagine that he or she would be perfectly capable of recreating many of those works from memory (and that other people might request such recreations). (Again, in music in particular, it&#39;s already routine that someone could have unambiguously copyrightable material memorized and be subject to copyright restrictions on performing songs. Like if a singer or band performs a cover from memory.)If you wanted to avoid this ability then you might need to build in an explicit notion of copyright that limits the accuracy or level of detail inside of the model in some way. This is tricky because (1) I don&#39;t think people have really tried to do this much so far, (2) copyright applies very differently to different categories of work, (3) it obviously wouldn&#39;t satisfy critics even if it mitigated the most extreme examples of &#34;regurgitation&#34;, and (4) it would be kind of weird because you would be intentionally limiting the quality and extent of learning that the system was allowed to do. (I imagine Jaron Lanier getting mad again about my repeated comparison between human learning and machine learning, and between human memory and machine memory)Some of the weirdness in point (4) is that accurate prediction is usually cool / great / impressive / accepted as an appropriate goal or capability, but if it&#39;s too accurate in certain contexts, it may be deemed a copyright infringement. Like if you said &#34;what word comes next? FOUR SCORE AND SEVEN YEARS AGO OUR FATHERS&#34;, there&#39;s a clear correct answer and knowing it requires having a certain text memorized. OK, if you said &#34;what word comes next? MR. AND MRS. DURSLEY OF NUMBER FOUR PRIVET DRIVE WERE PROUD TO SAY&#34; ... same thing, but Bloomsbury Publishing may be unhappy if you have a system that can get all such questions right."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"It would be sad if someone succeeded in shutting down CoPilot for this kind of copyright stuff. It is genuinely useful. I don&#39;t care that it reproduces copyrighted content. The only way you can get it to do that is to bait it with the function names of functions that have already been copy and pasted thousands of times onto GitHub without proper licenses.Luckily, someone will probably come out with a &#34;renegade&#34; version trained on whatever makes it a useful assistant to my coding. I won&#39;t be afraid of accidently violating copyright myself, because I won&#39;t be trying to bait it into reproducing heavily copy&amp;pasted cherrypicked examples, and I won&#39;t use 20 lines of its output with zero modification."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"A sizable, possibly plurality cohort of fully adult tech people is young enough to not know about United States v. Microsoft Corp. This would explain a lot of comments I see on this topic.If you don&#39;t know Microsoft&#39;s history, a lot of what more informed people are worried about seems overblown. Copilot was Microsoft&#39;s first test of people&#39;s trust after the GitHub acquisition. It&#39;s going very, very, very poorly. There were ways to do this with consent and collaboration with the people and projects it takes code from, but they&#39;re acting like classic Microsoft here.Too many people are focused on what&#39;s legal. It&#39;s fine to think of, but law is the last stop before the breakdown of society. Microsoft skipped society and went straight to sparking an inevitable test of and possible reshaping of copyright law."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I&#39;m sad that this is happening to an app that&#39;s useful to its users, but the reality is that scraping is legal, always possible, but difficult.This particular case is a bit harder since it&#39;s not purely using public data, but may still qualify since it&#39;s likely scraping with legally-obtained credentials.I know of businesses (scraping for ride-sharing, scraping for business intelligence for retailers, scraping from LinkedIn - see HiQ Labs v. LinkedIn) that have continuously succeeded via scraping in ways that large businesses oppose.The key is: you must make enough profit to justify dedicating engineering and legal techniques to defend your scraping.- Scraping public data is legal, as affirmed by the Supreme Court in Van Buren v. United States [1] and HiQ Labs v. LinkedIn [2]. Defending yourself or suing the data owner in court are both expensive though- Defeating anti-scraping via technical means is pretty much always possible, but can be costly depending on the scraped site&#39;s technical expertise and value in keeping their data private. The benefit to you must exceed the cost to you, and ideally should also exceed the cost to the data owner- Mobilizing PR and internal resistance may also be effective, but it&#39;s usually hard to have outcry from a large enough group to change an organization&#39;s policies. In this case, the union can push for it, but AA may try to withhold improvements until the next set of union negotiations1. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Van_Buren_v._United_States2. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HiQ_Labs_v._LinkedIn"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This is really a story about a celebrity&#39;s mental illness and public breakdown. If you haven&#39;t been following the news, West has spent the week saying increasingly unhinged things, not just about politics but about Pete Davidson, his wife, and (if I&#39;m remembering right) his kids and the fake actor children that have been installed in his former home to corrupt them. He was interviewed for a show on Fox and a big chunk of what he said was edited out and later leaked; the &#34;people at the Gap&#34; knew about Uvalde, Kanye is now a Black Hebrew Israelite, &amp;c. He&#39;s quite evidently sick, and these Parler people are scamming him."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Musk and everyone else is right that we do need a platform with free speech. The only problem is that all those free speech advocates are actually NIMBY&#39;s when it comes to free speech.I have been following self proclaimed free speech absolutists(because I too, believe in free speech but don&#39;t believe it exists) and they are totally not the kind of people that say &#34;I hate what you say but I will die defending your right to say it&#34;. In all places, these people are curating comments and posts to push agenda.The only somewhat free place I&#39;ve seen is 4Chan but it contains so much toxicity, that&#39;s its barely bearable.Yet again, I like that Musk and Kanye kind of people claim that they want free speech because at least we can hold them responsible when they don&#39;t deliver it. This is in contrast with the pure fascist where they cannot be held responsible for anything because they don&#39;t claim virtue in first place. It&#39;s a bit like companies doing greenwashing, which can be exposed when they don&#39;t deliver on their claimed virtues versus companies who don&#39;t even claim such virtues and instead pretend that it doesn&#39;t matter. Those who claim virtue are better even if they ultimately fail."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"How could an average outside observer distinguish between another&#39;s mental illness and a guy who&#39;s just a real out of the box thinker who might be wrong about many ideas but might also add value to the world by perceiving reality in an atypical way?A lot of posters are claiming Kanye is mentally ill and unable to manage his own affairs. What is the direct evidence of this? And I don&#39;t simply mean &#34;provide examples of opinions he&#39;s said that I don&#39;t understand or care for&#34;.I think it&#39;s pretty dangerous to be labeling people involved in the national dialogue as mentally ill without a diagnosis, or at least some substantial and direct evidence. This label could be weaponized by an authoritarian political movement in a very dangerous way if that&#39;s the precedent we&#39;re using."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I&#39;m curious how Sci-hub&#39;s approach compares to the What.cd/Redacted approach.IIUC Sci-hub has scooped up science docs through a good enough UX that it was able to leverage the goodwill of science folks to upload docs (plus whatever other methods it has used to scoop up docs), and it uses a public blitzkrieg-style distribution mechanism. I.e., I guess if one had a big enough harddrive and a fast enough internet connection, one could start downloading the lib right now and see if they win the race against the copyright holders.On the other hand, the What.cd/Redacted approach seems to use Bittorrent ratios to create a private-tracker economy. New users get a few gigs free download on joining. But apparently because a) there&#39;s a 1:1 upload/download ratio, and b) a few first-mover fat cats are sitting on enormous ratios, this means there is a scramble by everyone else to upload new FLACs to build up their ratio so they can continue to be able to download FLACs. It seems that would mean the library-in-its-entirety cannot be easily replicated at will. Yet the tracker was apparently already nuked off the internet as What.cd and reappeared later as Redacted. Was any data lost between the two services?Oh yeah, there&#39;s also apparently another approach in rutracker, which seems to be blitzkrieg to add content and publish, at the (apparent?) cost of quality of content.It&#39;s really a shame that the nerdy, completist domain of digital archiving through torrents isn&#39;t covered by fair use. Perhaps we could exclude the most recent 10 years of music so that the hopeful young musician streamers can get paid a few hundred dollars for millions of streams and then receive the silver lining of fair use protection against a label refusing to release one of their albums."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I think Alexandra Elbakyan actually did not want to be revealed as the librarian behind Sci-Hub, it was her poor opsec that led to her being identified.Basically her servers were set up to emit detailed error messages from PHP, including full path of faulting source file, which was under directory /home/ringo-ring, which could be traced to a username she had online on an unrelated site, attached to her real name. Before this revelation, she was anonymous."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"As an active hoarder I think there is problem with &#34;6. Distribution: Packaging it up in torrents, announcing it somewhere, getting people to spread it.&#34;.I miss a p2p application with torrent packaging and Kademlia like per-file advertising and discovery, where I could point it to my hefty NAS directory of random things and they could be wired to released torrents. This way we could make torrents live much longer, even partially complete. In super extra option the app could even notify me to load DVD because somebody asked for a file which I indexed and advertised previously.For years my program preferences changed, file locations changed - I have moved files around, made them offline, burned on DVDs, deleted some parts of torrent just to keep interesting stuff. Now these torrents are lost, at least my seeding contribution is gone. But I almost never change the content of these files, their checksum stays the same forever, so they could be still discoverable.The digital preservation needs better distribution system."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"“No shit”.Wait, you mean something that literally tracks any and all actions in a literal chain of history that is immutable is easy to track?!?You mean that pattern recognition can be applied to even “randomized” in both size, time, and destination of transactions can be done to track like how they can track burner phones?I’m shocked! Shocked I say!"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I have refused to shop at numerous stores because they make a point of not accepting cash. Cash is incredibly important for modern society due to actually being untraceable and allowing for private transactions. Plus, a society without cash is one where you are forced to use central banking. Blockchain is just trying to imitate cash digitally, which as it turns out is really hard to do. So it just ends up that people use central services anyways.The point is, cash is hard to trace. And that&#39;s a good thing. I personally refuse to shop anywhere that refuses cash, and I encourage you to do the same if possible."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Yeah, it&#39;s entirely built on the idea that every transaction is known by everyone. I think Lance is a bit confused. Maybe he should look into Monero.The point of Bitcoin is to enable anyone to exchange value with anyone. And it does that very well. When the US justice department declared that credit card companies had to stop processing donations to wikileaks I could still donate through bitcoin."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Here is a list of free Git hosting services for open source software:• https://github.com/• https://gitlab.com/• https://bitbucket.org/• https://codeberg.org/ (As per the linked article)• https://sr.ht/ (Sourcehut)Codeberg and Sourcehut appear to use open source code for their web page backend; the others seem to use proprietary software (in the case of GitLab, there is a free version, but gitlab.com also uses non-free software).Sourcehut says they may some day charge people to host open source software on their server, but right now it’s a free beer service (but, yes, I have donated) using Free (libre) software.Souceforge also has a proprietary free-to-use for open source Git hosting service, but their service is a little buggy so I would use one (or in my case, all) of the five I have listed.If there are any others, please let us know.In terms of continuous integration, in my particular use case, the automated CI tests take about an hour to all run, so I have a Raspberry Pi server the size of a deck of cards which runs Ubuntu 22.04. The server uses a crontab which checks to see if the Git repo has been updated once a day, and runs the tests inside a Docker container if the repo has changed.  Some problems, such as automated testing, don’t need to be solved by putting everything in a cloud."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;d like to plug self-hosting via Gitea. I have it running on a Raspberry Pi Zero(!) and it works really well[0]. I no longer star projects on GitHub: instead, I mirror them onto my Gitea server which periodically syncs in changes with a cadence of my choosing[1]. If a project I depend on ever gets deleted from GitHub, I&#39;ll have a reasonably up-to-date copy.If you have a Pi in a drawer somewhere, or an underutilized 512MB VPS, using it to self-host a Gitea instance is worthwhile!0.Using SQLite as the data store.1. Alternatively, you can use your Gitea instance as the primary, and have it push changes to other git servers like GitHub or Gitlab"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; However, you won’t be getting the advanced features like automation or other integration and collaboration features provided by GitHub.Codeberg is working on CI and you can request early access.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Hi there - one of the few pro sellers on HN here.You&#39;re planning on prospecting into one of the most rejection-heavy domains out there with small physical business. These people get dozens of calls per day from companies they&#39;ve never heard of - many of whom are trying to rip them off - and even the best ones (Groupon, Yelp, google ads, etc.) are basically just rent-seeking. Oh, and most have gatekeepers who don&#39;t care the slightest bit about your pitch.Because of that I&#39;d stay away from all this &#34;smile and dial&#34; advice. You&#39;ll have no chance. Go out there and hit the pavement and meet these people at their establishments at off hours. If you catch the owner in there at a good time - do your best to inform them of your products benefits and come up with a really good offer to get started (something that loses you money and time). Free Trial, free month of services, whatever makes sense based on the context of your business. The goal is NOT to make money or build a book of business at this point - it&#39;s to get a person happy with your software to sell to later.If the owner is too busy or whatever - have some stuff printed out for them to read later that you can drop off. Ideally with a small gift (coffee, food, candy, etc.) and come back in a few weeks to see if you catch them at a better time (again with a gift, until they talk).A solid entry level book would be Fanatical Prospecting by Jeb Blount.Good Luck.*edit to fix book name"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"To be frank you&#39;ve already committed the classic blunder of developer initiated startups.  You built before you sold.  Now there&#39;s no telling if what you built is what anyone wants.IMHO, and extrapolating a lot here it&#39;s very unlikely you will get any sale based off your MVP.  It&#39;s unlikely that you&#39;ve hit the right market fit without first having found customer #1.So I&#39;d back up a step and find someone with the problem you&#39;re trying to solve.  Offer the deal of a custom built solution to meet their need.  Once that&#39;s built and validated that it actually solves the problem then start selling to others."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"There&#39;s a difference between marketing and sales. You&#39;re building a solution to a problem. Marketing is about getting people who have the problem to know your solution exists. Sales is about convincing them to pay money to solve the problem.If you built the MVP but don&#39;t have customers yet, you should already have some people in mind who suffer from the problem your solution is supposed to solve. Selling is then just a conversation that loosely follows the following steps:  (a) Ask if they still have the problem
  (b) Ask if your proposed solution solves their problem
  (c) Ask them to spend money to buy your solution

Note that every step starts with &#34;ask&#34;. This means that you need to listen to their response. If they don&#39;t still have the problem, walk away. If your proposed solution doesn&#39;t solve their problem, listen to why not, and focus on improving your product until it does solve their problem (hopefully in a generic way such that your improvements will help you sell to other customers in the future). If they aren&#39;t willing to spend the price you&#39;re asking to buy a solution that they consider to be a solution to a problem they have, then find a way to add more value so that they will be willing to pay that price."</p>

Thank you for writing this. It&#39;s a great piece to point to whenever the next scandal gets &#34;exposed&#34; by click-seeking folks on the internet."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"It makes sense from a technical perspective why you&#39;d build a system like XCheck. The problem is that once you build XCheck you actually need to say to your C-suite and PR department &#34;Actually no, you can&#39;t say we treat everyone equally, we&#39;re manually going in and exempting certain people from scrutiny, and that&#39;s entirely within our discretion.&#34;The problem isn&#39;t technical, it&#39;s legal - you can&#39;t build a system that operates one way and then publicly misrepresent it."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I wish they would explain what xcheck is and how it works before the talk about the problems with it. This reads like a blog post to other Integrity FB engineers that already know that system."</p>
