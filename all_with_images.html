								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I&#39;m so happy to see this. I am working on publishing a book on leanpub, and leanpub disburses payments using paypal. Yesterday, I logged into my paypal account and I remembered that this happened to me and my funds and account were frozen since 2010 (something I must have put out of my mind :p).I was searching for this issue and found this lawsuit and cannot wait to be part of it.Dealing with Paypal during the time was borderline abusive and I felt helpless every step of the way. In 2010 when they froze my account they mailed me a physical letter with an activation code which took weeks, and when I called to confirm my account I was told that the code was incorrect...I had very very little money in my account &lt; $100 and I can&#39;t imagine how frustrating it would be for someone who needed paypal for their income.I&#39;m happy to be in a position where I can choose to never use paypal again and I hope they are punished for the way they treat their customers."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; Lena Evans, one of the plaintiffs who&#39;d been a PayPal user for 22 years, said the website seized $26,984 from her account six months after it got frozen without ever telling her why.Wait, what? They&#39;re actually taking the money? I thought the article was just being careless with the terms &#34;frozen&#34; and &#34;seized&#34;.On what power are they doing so? It&#39;s understandable when the relevant authorities (be it a tax authority, or a financial supervisory authority, or a court, or whatever) seize money, but they are not an authority.Furthermore, if the money in question actually were illicit, then by what fantasy argument would they be allowed to keep it themselves rather than having to hand it over to the goverment? The entire point is that the money is dirty and nobody may keep it."</p>

You should also consider not updating the OS (e.g., upgrading to Windows 11) and related Intel drivers to the latest versions in order to keep the Intel SGX feature from being removed from your PC. You should also ensure your platform meets all the other playback requirements of Ultra HD Blu-ray as the playback solution:
https://www.cyberlink.com/support/faq-content.do?id=19144Wow, the official solution is to use old hardware and software. I&#39;m sure that&#39;s a great idea :)Sarcasm aside, I wonder when corporations will realize that until they offer proper easy and affordable solutions, people have little incentives to actually jump through the official loops and simply not pirate content. I hope to see this realization sometime in my life, but maybe I&#39;m too optimistic."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;ll never understand the stupidity of studios/streaming platforms (DRM/Widevine). DRM only hurts legit customers, period. Any TV Show or Movie you want to watch is going to be on Torrents/Usenet within hours at most of release, their DRM has completely and utterly failed to stop piracy, instead it punishes paying users.I still remember a good decade ago getting a DVD from Redbox and trying to watch it with some friends. Tons of unskippable ads, FBI warnings, etc. Partway through the hell of enforced watching I started a torrent, before we got to the title screen it was done and we watched the downloaded version instead.Furthermore, look at the state of TV today with all the streaming platforms. I&#39;m excluding &#34;live&#34; TV because I can&#39;t imagine why anyone would subject themselves to that cesspool. Having to jump between streaming services/UIs/UX/etc is terrible. &#34;What platform was that show on?&#34;, &#34;Wait, weren&#39;t we watching this on service X? That&#39;s why it lost our place in the season&#34;, &#34;Oh, did they remove Y show?&#34;, and the list goes on.It&#39;s incredibly sad the the best TV experience is some combo of Plex/Jellyfin+*arr-type software. Music piracy is practically non-existent in my friend groups (the same could not be said 10+ years ago), Spotify and friends did that. Not any laws, not any enforcement, not any crackdowns, etc, no a /paid/ service beat music piracy. Why? Because it was better, it was easier, and it had everything. As long as we only have a choice of disjointed services and platforms TV/Movies will never be better than piracy.Things like Amazon Channels and Apple TV (yes the app, not the device, not the service, come on Apple...) are somewhat of a step in a better direction but Plex is still bar none. No ads, instant playback, no BS."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Here&#39;s a link to the article [0].Just a bit of background - 95% of humans will experience infection with EBV at some point in their lives.  Once you&#39;re infected, it remains latent, only flaring up in particular circumstances.  MS is an autoimmune disease, like many others, and this paper does not imply that EBV directly causes MS.  Obviously, as so many more people have EBV than have MS, EBV infection does not completely explain why people get MS.Just to put a small caveat to the paper.  The comparison is to EBV &#39;seronegative&#39; population - this is a minority of people (i.e. people who do not have evidence of being infected with EBV).  You could argue this is an &#39;unusual&#39; population in the first place and there&#39;s something about them that provides protection from MS.Another point is that EBV is a risk factor, there are other risk factors known too.  I think the key to understanding a lot of autoimmune diseases is to understand how our adaptive immune system works.  Our immune response is a very complex cell-to-cell interaction between millions of cells all with different roles, and how the immune system decides whether something is a threat or not is not, and how to respond to it, is not yet clear.[0] https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.abj8222"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I have MS and my first relapse was a pretty textbook case of transverse myelitis of the sort that the EBV can cause.I know some people have been asking about why that might be the case when a ton of people have EBV, and I think the causality may go the other way: Those of us with something wrong are more likely to both have EBV complications and MS.There are other viruses like this as well (ones that most people get/have but aren&#39;t dangerous). I was on one medication where I needed to be tested monthly because if I got one particular (normally harmless) virus, the suppression caused by the medication meant I would probably die.There&#39;s pretty clearly some sort of relation between the state of one&#39;s immune system + how it deals with &#39;benign&#39; viruses + auto-immunity, and I&#39;m excited to see what the future holds, but for now it&#39;s a cool confirmation of something a lot of MSers have talked about amongst ourselves for a while."</p>

https://www.nytimes.com/2022/01/13/opinion/america-falling-a...A loss of civic sense and cultural criminality are incredibly hard to weed out of a population, once it has taken root. I worry that the a mix of pessimism and a loss of civic sense is sending non-elite America into a death spiral.Opponents of return-to-normalcy claim that these are temporary and anomalous circumstances as a result of covid. However, a 2 year period of cultural erosion can lead to this regression getting cemented as a modern cultural identity of non-elite US.Cost-benefit analyses have been ignored in favor of tunnel-visioning on viral outcomes and short term political gain. At the end of this, we might just find ourselves asking &#34;We made it out of this, but at what cost?&#34;.p.s: I am not advocating for any particular policy, just pointing to the absence of any holistic response. That being said, the complete failure of the American response in terms of &#39;viral outcomes&#39; despite tunnel visioning on it, doesn&#39;t inspire confidence in it."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I&#39;ll be departing my job at the end of the month. I had too many roles, affecting too many pieces of engineering, and my title didn&#39;t reflect my work. I needed to go down to a 4 day work week and have my title reflect my roles, but my manager attempted to call my bluff and essentially said it&#39;s not going to happen. I hinted about what my decision would have to be if these accomodations couldn&#39;t be made, but he didn&#39;t budge. When I gave my verbal notice, suddenly there was immediate backpedaling and said maybe something could be worked out. I declined because I don&#39;t negotiate like that. If you mismanage a negotiation, there is no do-overs just because you overplayed your hand. The trust is broken."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Rather than look for another job I retired at 63.5. My job was long hours, high stress, high visibility, continuous deadlines and changes that never ended at a large non FAANG company. Compensation was OK (not FAANG but OK for where I am). Everything I or my team shipped worked great; but lots of things with these challenges never shipped for political/idiotic reasons. So much budget was wasted on Exec whims and fantasy. I just grew tired of the frustration. If I were younger I would have left and gone to the local competition or even moved somewhere. But enough was enough after almost 6 years here.I still write code but now its just for me to support my generative art. I still hear stories from my former team; not missing the nightmare at all."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"One of the good things that I think happened from the pandemic is that more and more people are realizing that tying up your identity and sense of self-worth in your job is a bad thing, that&#39;s why I&#39;m very glad to see compensation so high on this list.Sure, everyone wants to work in a good working environment, but I think the idea that &#34;nobody left because of the money&#34; is finally being put to bed.The fact is that corporations and VCs have always realized that business is primarily just about the money, and their ability to get people to work for their &#34;passion&#34; has resulted in people getting underpaid. I&#39;m always especially amused when people are expected to have &#34;passion&#34; when they&#39;re working at like a bank or an insurance company.You work to make money. There are plenty of opportunities for hobbies and volunteering for passions. I&#39;m not saying you shouldn&#39;t enjoy what you do at work, but don&#39;t lose sight of why someone is paying you to do it."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&gt; it&#39;s substantially more work to clean and organize the code for publishing, it will increase the surface for nitpicking and criticism (e.g. coding style, etc).Matt Might has a solution for this that I love:  Don&#39;t clean &amp; organize!  Release it under the CRAPL[0], making explicit what everyone understands, viz.:&#34;Generally, academic software is stapled together on a tight deadline; an expert user has to coerce it into running; and it&#39;s not pretty code. Academic code is about &#39;proof of concept.&#39;&#34;[0] https://matt.might.net/articles/crapl/"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Hi, I’m a Research Software Engineer (a person who makes software that helps academics/researchers) at a university in the UK. My recommendation is that not only do you publish the code, you mint a DOI (digital object identifier, Zenodo is usually the go to place for that) for the specific version that was used in your paper and you associate them. And you include a citation file (GitHub supports them now: https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/managing-your-reposi...) in your software repo.Benefits: people who want to reproduce your analysis can use exactly the right software, and people who want to build on your work can find the latest in your repo. Either know how to cite your work correctly.In practice drive-by nitpicking over coding style is not that common, particularly in (some) science fields where the other coders are all other scientists who don’t have strong views on it. Nitpicks can be easily ignored anyway.BTW should you choose to publish, the Turing Way has a section on software licenses written for researchers: https://the-turing-way.netlify.app/reproducible-research/lic..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; The paper itself is enough to reproduce all the results.No, this is almost never the case. It should be. But it cannot really be. There are always more details in the code than in the paper.Note that even the code itself might not be enough to reproduce the results. Many other things can matter, like the environment, software or library versions, the hardware, etc. Ideally you should also publish log files with all such information so people could try to use at least the same software and library versions.And random seeds. Make sure this part is at least deterministic by specifying the seed explicitly (and make sure you have that in your log as well).Unfortunately, in some cases (e.g. deep learning) your algorithm might not be deterministic anyway, so even in your own environment, you cannot exactly reproduce some result. So make sure it is reliable (e.g. w.r.t. different random seeds).&gt; In my field many scientists tend to not publish the code nor the data.This is bad. But this should not be a reason that you follow this practice.&gt; clean and organize the code for publishingThis does not make sense. You should publish exactly the code as you used it. Not a restructured or cleaned up version. It should not be changed in any way. Otherwise you would also need to redo all your experiments to verify it is still doing the same.Ok, if you did that as well, then ok. But this extra effort is really not needed. Sure it is nicer for others, but your hacky and crappy code is still infinitely better than no code at all.&gt; it will increase the surface for nitpicking and criticismIf there is no code at all, this is a much bigger criticism.&gt; publishing the code will be removing the competitive advantageThis is a strange take. Science is not about competing against other scientists. Science is about working together with other scientists to advance the state of the art. You should do everything to accelerate the process of advancement, not try to slow it down. If such behavior is common in your field of work, I would seriously consider to change the field."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Hi HN,This idea has been a dream of mine for years [0]. As a web developer, I never learned After Effects or any other complex animation software.But I&#39;ve always dreamed of creating interactive demos and animations just by using my natural mouse movements. It just feels right.So last week I took a few days off from my main project to create Animatize [1], a proof-of-concept showing off the idea of using natural movement to create an animation.I&#39;d love to know what you think.[0] http://motioncomicbuilder.storylog.com/[1] https://github.com/panphora/animatize"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is such a cool project. Quick suggestion: would be nice to have some way of &#34;smoothening&#34; the animations; I think a simple interface for that would make it a lot more usable in practice. The human hand is a bit shaky :)Anyway, bookmarked!"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is what ergonomics looks like. Even small children can convey the movement of actors through space using similar techniques. It&#39;s an extremely natural way to communicate how something moves. But we have lost that basic idea in favor of very precise animation tools and the complexity that comes with them."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"A huge problem with this industry is the inflexibility to pay current engineers LARGELY increasing comp each year. The thought is that there is a market rate for an engineer and that pay can increase with the market rate, but this is a fallacy. An engineer that has been at a largish company for 1 year is worth 20-30% more than the year they were hired because they have specific knowledge of the tech stack. Yet that engineer will likely be offered a 3-5% raise. An engineer with 3+ years might be worth 50%+ because they have developed the specific skills relevant to the job AND know the idiosyncacies about org politics and the nitty gritty parts of the codebase. Yet they will still only get a 10-15% raise. So that engineer moves on and accepts a 40% raise elsewhere. And thus we see the constant churn of highly talented engineers which is a huge drain on productivity for all involved."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Perhaps I’ve been unlucky but my experience at big tech has been marred by churn and burn culture - high pressure tactics to get the most work out of employees and discarding them when they inevitably burn out. Average tenure was 1-3 years.  Amazon was particularly bad at this. The only modicum of power employees have is in quitting and now that they’re exercising it the employers are acting like their throats have been cut.Edit: a story I like to tell people about what it’s like to deal with Big Co. is that I solo built a $50Mp.a. profit data science artifact in my first year. They offered me the highest once off bonus on offer $30K stretched over 6 years, no promotion (those were used to keep US citizens). I said, give me the same bonus as my manager for for ‘managing’ my project ~$150K in one year or I’ll quit. They said no so I quit. The artifact was extremely difficult to build and written in Scala, it took a lot out of me, no one understood it after I left. They rewrote it in Java which made it even harder to understand. It atrophied over 5 years and now it doesn’t even work at all. I’m in contact with my former colleagues and keep offering to fix it for 7 figures, but no dice. They’ve now convinced themselves it is impossible to do. That’s how committed they are to maintaining the status quo."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This article does accidentally capture one of the major corporate problems pretty well. The conclude from their data that Toxic Workplace Culture is the biggest cause of resignation, and then they immediately suggest 4 short term things to try that don&#39;t relate to culture at all.If you have a toxic workplace culture, the very first thing you should do is to start fixing your culture. This is very hard and not fast (as they acknowledge to be fair). One thing you can do though is to acknowledge it to your employees - &#34;X, Y and Z is wrong and we&#39;re working to fix it&#34;. Nothing destroys morale more than employees being unhappy about a set of things and then management standing up and telling you there aren&#39;t any problems."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"1) At the blocking moment I had only 2 videos (just screen records) on my channel which showed the same problem in 2 different Grammarly products
2) these videos were an illustration for my report https://hackerone.com/reports/1282282, which Grammarly disclosed to the public and does not consider this a problem.
3) these videos were published after Grammarly representatives allowed me to release this information
4) in the description of the video there were links to the HackerOne case for the problem  and to my blog https://evilksandr.medium.com/7bdb343c956b with a detailed study of this problem
5) the video was posted for educational purposes only and without malicious intent
I believe that my channel was blocked by mistake.
Please, anyone who knows somebody from YT/G team, tag them in my tweet."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"A Grammarly team member but posting own thoughts to clarify some things.First, Grammarly has nothing to do with this suspension and does not have any problem with the videos in question, just as mentioned in the official HackerOne response.Second, this is not a hack or even a flaw. It is an attempt to use Grammarly for a NON-INTENDED purpose, that predictably did not work. Grammarly is not meant for anti-plagiarism policy enforcement. Grammarly aims to help users avoid accidental or unintentional plagiarism by highlighting parts that may need to be cited. So it does not attempt to deal with any plagiarism enforcement countermeasures. If someone is deliberately masking plagiarism with these countermeasures, it&#39;s definitely NOT unintentional or accidental and a whole different issue altogether, so Grammarly does not get involved with this, by design. Bypassing the tool that is designed to HELP YOU avoid getting in trouble with accidental plagiarism is not a hack but more like &#34;bypassing&#34; your wifi by putting your own router in a microwave - defeating the purpose rather than defeating security. So Grammarly does not care about these videos (although I think presenting this as a hack or a flaw is a little unfair).Finally, Youtube&#39;s automated (I&#39;m guessing) blocking often does strange things. My account was once blocked for supposedly violating Sony&#39;s video game copyright. The video in question was me driving a car on a race track, in real life. It got unblocked within a week or two, though."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"After Grammarly spent millions of dollars on Google ads, I expect them not to accept valid criticism on Google platforms.But it&#39;s unfair to block a guy that talked about a real flaw in Grammarly&#39;s plagiarism checker, at least pretend that you allow free speech and take down that video for a random reason specified in your ToS."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I think this article has come up before? Either way, it&#39;s a quirky thing for Gravitational to post, since their flagship project --- Teleport --- basically eliminates bastion servers altogether (you might think of it as an API-controlled self-contained bastion server). Teleport is free, and worth checking out: it solves a bunch of SSH management problems, not just controlling access, but also linking SSH access to SSO, running fleet-wide commands selectively, and generating transcripts of SSH sessions.Teleport is kind of big and sprawling. But they&#39;ve repeatedly contracted Doyensec to do assessment work for it, and Doyensec is a fantastic firm. I think parked behind Tailscale, so none of your SSH infra is exposed to the Internet to begin with, it&#39;s a pretty great solution, and I&#39;d do that again before I ever hand-tooled an SSH bastion host again."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"There&#39;s a few weird things, but it&#39;s mostly okay.Do not trust the firewall on the bastion host, if an attack can get into the bastion host, they can disable the firewall, so it cannot be used to limit egress. It&#39;s better than nothing, but consider using a firewall that&#39;s managed on a via a separate management network. I do agree that you should only allow SSH from a few known IPs.Limiting the number of users is weird, and not recommended. Create all the accounts you need to provide individual accounts for the staff that need to access the bastion host, you will need that as things like HIPAA require named accounts for auditing. None of the accounts need any privileges other than the most basic. Users do not need sudo/root privileges on a jump host.Other than those two complains, it&#39;s good recommendations.A final recommendation: If you use AWS though, consider using Session Manager instead of SSH and drop the bastion host. You can still connect using the SSH command, using proxy command in OpenSSH, but no public IP or bastion host is required."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"It does not seem to be mentioned here. But, my #1 hardening suggestion is install the Tripwire IDS (Intrusion Detection System). It is probably the best thing you could ever do for yourself as a system administrator. It integrity checks the entire file system. If anything happens to your system that you didn&#39;t authorize you&#39;re notified of it immediately. After initial install it is important to minimize and exclude false positives so that you end up with a system that rarely changes in ways you don&#39;t expect or can at least explain.Another really useful tool is logwatch.I actually caught an intruder this way hijacking my system several years ago. They removed rkhunter, chkrootkit and a variety of log files. And, modified lines in the last logged in users log. But, a combination of logwatch and tripwire caught it.https://opensource.com/article/18/1/securing-linux-filesyste..."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"One of my favorite things to do with these neat little games is to build something that plays them for me by just pasting stuff into the browser JS console.https://pastebin.com/aTYuaNVSAt a score of 1,619 the ball is moving so fast it no longer works! I switched to a new tab (hoping that the event loop would be sent to the background/context switch/whatever) and ta-da - it misclicked. High score of 1,637."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Great stuff, got 315 on third try. I made a game in the same vein sometime ago: https://vladimirslepnev.itch.io/zigzagOne thing to note about this kind of endless runner games is the scoring system. Everyone uses the system &#34;get as much points as possible in one run, each run starts from zero&#34;. But that forces people to slog through the early parts each time, and also makes them more likely to stop playing after an especially good run. I thought about this for a while, and came up with the idea that a better system would dock points for mistakes. The run would continue, a misclick would just give you a short breather and set you back fifty points or so.I made some prototypes like that and the effect was striking: you stick with one run for a long time, falling into a kind of meditative state, never wanting to stop. Eventually you find an equilibrium where wins and losses balance out, and keep playing there, at the best of your ability. If I ever release an endless runner again, it will use that system."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is a great little time waster!Couple of recommendations, in no particular order:1. Keep the ball moving even after you die. Instead of pressing start, the user will just click when the ball is back inside the colored area.
2. You can click anywhere to restart, but you have to click the play button to restart. You should allow the user to just click anywhere to restart.
3. When you fail, show where the ball was.
4. As for collision detection, I think you should err on being lenient and count success if the bounds of the circle overlap, rather than the center or entirely. I think this is also due to the rounded linecaps for the arc potentially not counting as part of the valid area.
5. Show where the next arc will be. This is more of a game design thing. If you do this, quick fade out of the old and fade in on the new would look nice.I understand that this was probably a small little one off project, and that there&#39;s always more you can iterate on, so I just want to say nice job in putting out a fun little time waster!"</p>

Telemetry was first implicated because it&#39;s one of the first services a normal Firefox configuration will connect first, but presumably the bug will trigger with any other connection to such a server.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"There are three problems that colleges need to fix.1) Skilled trades pay better than most bachelor&#39;s degree track jobs. My kids can make more money with a six month apprenticeship than they will with all but a few 4 year degrees. If you can drive a forklift, you can make $45K/yr... which is identical to what an firsty year teacher makes.2) There are better options than college for many. One of my daughters did a six month digital marketing bootcamp. She made $45k year one, and a year later is the director of marketing at her company making over $100k/yr.3) College is way over priced. They claim graduates make 40% over their lifetime vs. non grads. JP Morgan Chase did a study two years ago that shows kids that had a job, any job before age 18 make 35% more than their peers over their lifetime regardless of degree.4) Student loans are a horror that needs to stop. Young people should not be put in debt-bondage. Imagine America&#39;s financial health if we let young people start families and careers debt free."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I have 3 college-aged kids and one nearly there. Their universal concern is the cost. It has become prohibitive.Colleges assumed the trend of charging $25k to $50k per year would be sustainable. They were dead wrong, especially given the horrendously predatory loans backed by the government and barred from bankruptcy.If we fix the college financial system, enrollment would likely skyrocket."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is nearly a strictly American problem. Much of the rest of the world has realized that society requires and is capable of supporting advanced education for all -- after all we want humanity to be advancing, right?America is still stuck in this alternate universe where it&#39;s a great privilege to have the opportunity to learn, which is of course true to some extent, but they really put it on a pedestal there.Compared to the rest of the world, I think they over index on attending prestigious out-of-state and thus expensive, regardless of public or private, instead of building a really strong system for locals.I think of my (non-US) classmates, maybe 1-2 per 100 were from a different region or country? I paid a total of $20k over five years which I easily covered with internships/summer jobs. Can you say the same in the US?"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"One of my favorite bits from Tim&#39;s videos was during a tour of Firefly Aerospace&#39;s facility when they talk about engine cooling.  They discuss EDM machining small holes into the coolant channels just before the throat, which lets a small amount of cryogenic coolant out to cool the interior.  The funny part is that you can purposefully undersize the holes and they will melt larger until they are big enough to adequately cool the engine.  You basically pre-season the engine with a test-fire and let it choose how much internal cooling it needs.https://youtu.be/ac-V8mO0lWo?t=2203"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Minor nitpick: fluids are not either liquids or gases, this is particularly true for rocket engines where many of the discussed processes (injection, compression, regenerative coolant flow) actually occur at super- or transcritical conditions.Also, I don&#39;t think you can say the faceplate is heat sink-cooled. Remember that just behind it is the propellant manifold, so it&#39;s rather some form of regenerative cooling."</p>

They give me the same kind of feeling I had when Apple was kicking butt in the early 2000s. And I think that for them to become a general-audience company, they need to really own more of their software. They have some great ideas, and they&#39;ve already plugin&#39;ed Gnome to within and inch of it&#39;s life; it&#39;s time to move out on their own. And it&#39;s not like a new DE means apps won&#39;t work. DEs are just the window dressing and computer management.What I really wonder about is Wayland support. Is this going to be a brand-new DE that&#39;s X only? That would be a real shame. I know System76 has stuck doggedly to X because they sell so many NVidia cards, but NVidia supports GBM now."</p>

For convenience, you can then use either TOTP or Email (if you specify both, it will default to using TOTP) to login thereafter to make things quicker (it can take up to a minute until profiles update).I generally wait about 5 seconds between checks of a profile, hopefully this isn&#39;t too much additional strain (especially since I expect most people to switch to something faster after the first login).[EDIT] Also it&#39;s night time (well morning I guess) where I am so... spinning up some more instances and I&#39;m going to sleep.[EDIT2] My email is plastered all over the site, but please feel free to email me any bug reports![EDIT3] If you&#39;d like to register an app, please check out https://mailing-list.vadosware.io/subscription/form ! Ignore all the other mailing list stuff and get on the &#34;early adopters&#34; list for LoginWithHN! Or just email me in my HN profile, whichever!"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Using forums as pseudonymous identity providers is a very powerful idea. It&#39;s essentially community federation. There is of course risk that your IDP chucks your account and you lose access to the other ones, but that&#39;s solvable with a recovery scheme.Lightweight, low assurance credentials probably have the biggest growth future, as if universal high assurance credentials were really that commercially desirable, we&#39;d already have them. These are a kind of affinity credential, which has a lot of optionality."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The speed of light story is a fun conjecture, but given the discrepancy (30cm vs 5.5mm), I don&#39;t think that&#39;s it. Light travels slower in wires but not that much slower, and increased design clocks don&#39;t explain the discrepancy either.I think it&#39;s more likely that this is an artifact of the interconnect design. For example, the interconnect may be designed as a tree, where the path from core 0 to the L2 only visits a branch but the path to core1/2 has to traverse the root of the tree. If each stage adds a clock cycle, there&#39;s your 4 clock cycles: one to go to the root, one back down to the other side, and then the whole thing in the other direction for the reply from L2 with the data.If the interconnect had been a ring bus instead, you&#39;d find that the latency from cores 0 and 2 is the same, but higher for core 1 - assuming no other endpoints in the ring, but that&#39;s obviously not the case, since I/O needs to be on the bus too. It&#39;s possible he got the core numbers wrong in the die shot, and core 0 is the bottom left core. Then if the ring goes clockwise L2 - core 0 - core 1 - core 2 - I/O on the top right - L2, that&#39;s how you end up with core 0 being closer to the L2 in terms of clock cycles than the others, and the observation would be consistent with this design too."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I was working on the central technology team at EA during the run up to the launch of the Xbox 360 and some of us got early access to help prepare for the new architecture.I was blown away by the amount of technical detail we were getting access to and how clearly explained it was. Much of that was thanks to Bruce Dawson. I remember devouring everything I could find that he&#39;d written and it was a fascinating crash course in CPU architecture for a relatively young software engineer at the time with little hardware background. Thanks Bruce!"</p>

But in sciences and engineering the repeated reading of the material is not usually encouraged or talked about.It would be interesting to see what the material was, it&#39;s not linked, but it must have been really detailed."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This is amazing! Seen a lot of work around Rust and JS / JSX / TS / TSX (notably SWC[0] is moving to be a Rust based version of Babel) not so much around CSS.My genunine hope is this will replace PostCSS sooner rather than later. PostCSS isn&#39;t the most performant thing I&#39;ve worked with, and a lot of plugins for PostCSS rely on doing multiple passes at the AST, they can slow down significantly as a resultFor that however, we will need some kind of plugin system. I know the SWC[0] project has had some struggles with this as their current JS API relies on serializing the AST back and forth. I wonder if this forgoes a JS API entirely or if that is something planned for say 1.5?[0]: https://swc.rs/"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"When a site&#39;s CSS is well written, with a capable web developer knowing, what they are doing, such a tool would not be necessary. People pump out megabytes of JavaScript, but then they worry about a few kilobytes of CSS being saved by compressing it, at the same time making it less readable by minifying it. (We are not yet shipping hundreds of kilobytes of CSS, are we?!)When there is a need for a tool that minifies CSS, then people seriously need to ask themselves, how it can be, that they have that much CSS. How much redundant CSS can you accumulate? Was there no coherent styling idea or strategy, so that every thing on the page needs separate styling?What many forget is, that data is often sent gzip compressed anyway, which naturally takes advantage of repeated parts to compress. Text usually compresses pretty well. Especially something like a description language with many repeating parts. It is great, that Parcel CSS is faster than some other tool. However, for me, these kind of tools are merely treating the symptoms of not doing styling properly. I&#39;m glad, that I got to know the web, when you simply could look at all the source of a page and learn from it, instead of facing a multi megabyte &#34;minified&#34; script and &#34;minified&#34; CSS."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Having worked for both union and non-union employers - it&#39;s a mixed bag. Unions have advantages and disadvantages. They are great for worker representation - but that&#39;s a double-edged sword. Ideally, unions protects worker&#39;s interests. In practice, they often lead to abuse, stagnation and corruption. I&#39;ve personally witnessed union employees who contributed nothing for years, get perpetually shifted from team to team to team and even promoted because it was too complex and costly to fire them. I&#39;ve seen union stewards padding their own pockets with members dues through lavish &#34;retreats&#34; to five-star resorts. We must not forget that unions are made up of people - and people can be awful."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"What really raises the most suspicion of the lab leak theory in my mind was how the Chinese government acted towards the rest of the scientific community...well before it was a theory at all. Not allowing foreign scientists in, destroying evidence, arresting journalists, etc. That just screams cover-up, even if there was none (in terms of a lab leak.)Then Western scientists that rely on grants with Chinese ties, etc trying to cover the asses publicly, while privately saying it&#39;s possible...really doesn&#39;t inspire a lot of public confidence imo. There is a pretty big monetary incentive from the very people that we&#39;d want to figure this out to say it didn&#39;t happen, even if it did."</p>

It was in 2017, around April 12th when we launched Postmates Unlimited - the subscription program that inspired all this. Now, we all know Postmates didn&#39;t win the space but some product decisions outlast a company and this was one one of them. I still remember the meeting when we decided to launch the subscription. No one had ever done it, the board thought it was nuts. It became the industry standard. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I feel like these marketplaces could maybe justify 30% on the purchase of an app up front, where there are clear benefits to the exposure and platform offered by them. But ongoing revenue is really attributable to the app itself and feels to me much harder to justify.At this point I’d be happy if Apple just let me install apps outside their ecosystem, then they could at least defend themselves by saying if the developers aren’t happy with the terms of the App Store they can offer alternative methods."</p>

Uber and Lyft should be kicked out of the App Store.&gt; Laws and Regulations wants to fine Apple for Anti-Trust and Anti Competitive practice, Apple should pull out those market, that is the EU common market, Australia, Japan, South Korea, Russia, India!I wish I made these sentiment up, except you will find many Apple apologist supporting Apple writing exactly that.But none of these matters to the general public. Apple is Three Trillion Market Cap company, they are very successful, selling iPhone and Mac in record numbers. Tim Cook will continue to tell you Apple is making the world a better place. To enrich people&#39;s lives. And privacy is a fundamental human right. [ Subject to Terms and Condition ].

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I need to share something as literally today I fixed a bug in our project that&#39;s somewhat related.MS SQL encodes everything with UTF-16. Emojis (code points) require up to 4 bytes. If it&#39;s a grapheme (emoji constructed from emojis), it will be even more.We are using Django. If you check length of an emoji, it will give you `1` and Django assumes utf8 everywhere. If you try to save it to PostgreSQL with char field `max_length=1` it will work just fine, but on MS SQL it will fail as it requires 2 characters (4 bytes) in the DB!I tried it with MS SQL 2017, 2019 with different collations on nvarchar and I&#39;m pretty sure there&#39;s no way around it.&gt; Because in CHAR(n) and VARCHAR(n) or in NCHAR(n) and NVARCHAR(n), the n defines the byte storage size, not the number of characters that can be stored, it&#39;s important to determine the data type size you must convert to, in order to avoid data truncation.https://docs.microsoft.com/en-US/sql/relational-databases/co..."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"SQLite is a relational database. Wouldn&#39;t it be a better fit to use a graph-database as the backend for anything &#34;web&#34;?The idea is good, that a web-page should be generated from some data somewhere. But &#34;web&#34; is much about not a single document but the links between the documents, which allow you to to represent a &#34;semantic net&#34;.  The data should be  about the links between them. Now where is such a database?  And how can it &#34;sharded&#34; into multiple databases running in thousands of locations on the internet?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I have a similar idea with PDF documents. Instead of having the royal PITA of parsing generated PDFs (e.g. invoices), things would be much simpler if every generated PDF came with a built-in SQLite or JSON that contains the structured data of that PDF.One day I will do it.Speaking more broadly, whether we talk about HTML or PDF it&#39;s the same problem: documents should have two representations - human-friendly and machine-friendly until AI gets so good that only having the human-friendly representation is enough."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The semantic web is not a technical problem, it&#39;s an incentive problem.RSS can be considered a primitive separation of data and UI, yet was killed everywhere. When you hand over your data to the world, you lose all control of it. Monetization becomes impossible and you leave the door wide open for any competitor to destroy you.That pretty much limits the idea to the &#34;common goods&#34; like Wikipedia and perhaps the academic world.Even something silly as a semantic recipe for cooking is controversial. Somebody built a recipe scraping app and got a massive backlash from food bloggers. Their ad-infested 7000 word lectures intermixed with a recipe is their business model.Unfortunately, we have very little common good data, that is free from personal or commercial interests. You can think of a million formats and databases but it won&#39;t take off without the right incentives."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is extremely impressive. It’s the first GAN I have seen which lets you tweak the result in a meaningful way rather than being just random.I think the speed that GANs have come in to the world has really shaken people up and it’s hard to process what this all means and what it will result in. Especially the ones which generate based on real people.But the feeling this gives me, is what happens for the future of art. Sure, this example is no where even close to replacing real artists, but it’s already generating images better than I can draw after a year of practice. It does give me a feeling of “what is the point”. Which might be an irrational feeling, but I’m sure others feel the same."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&gt; Sock shoe sock shoe or sock sock shoe shoe?This is an amusing question. I was thoroughly confused by what this meant.In my country, I keep my socks in a completely different room from my shoes. So when I put on clothes, I first have to put on socks, then leave the room, and then put on the shoes. I&#39;ve observed the same in Germany, France, Austria, Poland, and Spain (off the top of my head).As a separate issue, the habit of walking in shoes within your house is still utterly baffling to me. I&#39;ve seen people not walk in shoes even at the office (because it&#39;s uncomfortable). Can&#39;t imagine the smell of feet after walking in shoes the whole day."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"A more recent example of &#34;how the heck do I pronounce this word&#34; is Bazel, the build system.I&#39;ve always pronounced it like &#34;hazel&#34;, but many of my colleagues rhyme it with &#34;dazzle&#34;.The Bazel website even has an FAQ entry about it, but they managed to completely confuse the issue:&gt; How do you pronounce “Bazel”?&gt; The same way as “basil” (the herb) in US English: “BAY-zel”. It rhymes with “hazel”. IPA: /ˈbeɪzˌəl/https://bazel.build/faq.htmlLittle problem here... Basil, the herb, can be pronounced either like hazel or like dazzle. Or even rhymed with hassle!So naturally I opened a PR attempting to clarify this. It led to an interesting discussion, and in the end I wrote a bad poem acknowledging both pronunciations:https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel-website/pull/323"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The most stunning outcome here is the apparent internet consensus that Star Wars is better than Star Trek.This is indefensible.A Star Wars fan will tell you there are, at most, four good Star Wars movies. A Star Trek fan will tell you there are 6-7 good Star Trek movies, depending on whether you count Galaxy Quest. This might leave us with some room for debate about whether the cultural impact of Star Wars episodes 4 and 5 outweigh Star Trek&#39;s larger amount of quality material.Except that Star Trek is a TV show.For the movie franchise to not even be the better movie franchise is just... there&#39;s... it&#39;s not even a question."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"With all the lock-in and connectedness of Google owned systems, they cannot complain.  And it&#39;s not Apple&#39;s fault that Google can&#39;t build long term successes in most products it creates.  That&#39;s a management/strategy problem.How many messaging systems has Google had over the years?Their shotgun approach works financially, but it means that only a few of their projects really stick (win).  The rest just trundle along until they get discontinued.The hypocricy is tiresome.  When there&#39;s a regulation that threatens them, they make a lot of noise about &#34;free market&#34;, and &#34;let the market decide&#34;.  But when the market decides against them, they want some government intervention."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"All Google had to do was to keep improving on their original messaging software, Google Talk.Similarly, Microsoft would likely be a dominant player in the chat space today if they hadn&#39;t rebranded and renamed MSN Messenger several times and then abandoned it altogether.MSN Messenger was frickin awesome. You could draw pictures into the chat window. You could play a game of checkers while you chatted. It had a thriving ecosystem of apps and plugins. Everyone I knew used MSN Messenger... and then one day, Microsoft just said screw it, everyone can move to slow and clunky Skype... and that was the end of it.Hell, ICQ might still be around if AOL had put more development resources into it.The chat space is so bloody fragmented now, but it has nothing to do with Apple. Any one of the above mentioned companies could be killing it in this space if they hadn&#39;t pissed away what they had."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Google shouldn&#39;t have done its part to kill XMPP if they really cared about lock-in.iMessage is incredibly popular with certain demographics in the United States -- it&#39;s an in-group signifier the way teens have always had in-group signifiers (when I was in high school, it was AIM, a Nokia, and wearing Abercrombie) and that isn&#39;t about bullying. If Google had its way, its products would be used as the ways to &#34;bully&#34; the out-group. So this is much ado about nothing.It is notable that iMessage has persisted with its popularity in the US for as long as it has. And it is true that iMessage is definitely an ecosystem carrot, again, in the US. But in countries that didn&#39;t adopt SMS/MMS the same way we did in the US (b/c of cost/international variance/etc), the in-group messaging app is something else. It&#39;s always fascinating for me to go to other countries and see a ton of iPhone users not using iMessage but something else because that app has become the in-group signifier.And every teen I know uses Discord more than they use almost anything else. The ranking typically goes Discord, IG, iMessage.Having said all of that -- even if you took away iMessage, the iPhone would still be a status symbol/in-group signifier for a lot of people, especially young adults in the US. Samsung has had the best track record with some of its devices with approaching similar brand loyalty/&#34;it&#34; factor, but even if Apple adopted RCS -- it&#39;s not like the phone all the influencers and cool teens would be using would be Pixels. It would still be the iPhone for a host of reasons that have absolutely nothing to do with technology. White earbuds have been a fashion marker for 20 years now and that&#39;s what this comes down to. It isn&#39;t about lock-in or regulation or technology. It&#39;s about fashion."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Looks nice, well done.I&#39;d also like to add that it seems like a missed opportunity here. It could have been named OBoy."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"OCaml has recently interested me for being one of the few languages that:- Compiles to a binary
- Achieves good speed
- Is functional, while accommodating imperative styles.
- Has a static typeIn particular, it interests me because of how Forth or a threaded code-based VM could be implemented in it. You could implement the operations of such a machine with a bunch of individual function calls, but that&#39;s slow and rather unnecessary. A jump to the next VM instruction&#39;s code is what you want instead.Switch statements or pointers to labels are what are often used, but that means you end up with hundreds or even thousands of lines of code which cannot be split into modules. The solution OCaml and other functional languages provide involves tail-call optimization:  let rec first x = print_endline &#34;foo&#34; ; second(x)
  and second x = print_endline &#34;bar&#34; ; first(x);;

  first 1;;

In a usual compiled language, these two functions would only be able to print &#39;foobar&#39; a few hundred or thousand times before causing a stack overflow. In a language like OCaml this can run forever, and quickly too. This allows for what this web page calls continuation-passing threaded code:https://www.complang.tuwien.ac.at/forth/threaded-code.htmlI have mocked up the concept in lua, an imperative language with tail call optimization, and it was quite easy to implement a basic Forth while keeping the code legible. To take the idea further OCaml feels like a good choice. If anyone has experience with OCaml, or any warnings, it would be helpful."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I can say with full confidence that this at least has nothing to do with their hostage situation:&gt; Having no formal support channelWhen I last had to deal with their so-called support, all contact details were very efficiently hidden. Once you found a page with a phone number, and the hours you could call them, there was one final surprise:&#34;The phone number you are trying to reach is not in use&#34;. The only contact that works reliably at LastPass is their billing department. Make of that what you will."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Watch out! Another &#34;bug&#34; of the LastPass happens when you export your accounts.I have exported all my accounts via the web interface, and the three times I&#39;ve done that it export a truncated CSV file with about 30 lines, while printing the whole file content in the web page you access. That means the CSV you downloaded probably is not complete and you have to copy some lines from the web.I was lucky to investigate a weird warning, about some missing fields in the last row, that SQLite gave me after importing all the accounts to a database."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Just before Christmas I got an urge to add a dither filter to my JS canvas library. The past few weeks have certainly been a very intense adventure through a very deep rabbit hole involving color spaces, color distances and discovering how to generate a best-fit reduced palette of colors and then dither it (hello, blue noise!)I finally managed to complete the work last week and I&#39;m quite happy with the results. Using the library people can set the colors of graphical objects or gradients using any CSS color space string (RGB, HSL, HWB, LAB, LCH) and the color should render as expected. The reduce-noise filter uses LAB internally to calculate color distances, but in the end I compromised and used euler distances for the algorithm rather than one of the more modern algorithms.Work is still on a branch in the library[1] but I&#39;m hoping to merge it into the main code in the next week or so (after testing across devices/screens/etc).Aside: Safari has gone ahead and introduced support for HWB, LAB and LCH color strings in CSS. Sadly, they&#39;re not recognised by Safari&#39;s canvas engine (yet). Also, their HSL and HWB gradients seem to be the same as the RGB gradients; their LAB/LCH gradients seem to dodge the dreaded Gray Zone.[1] - https://github.com/KaliedaRik/Scrawl-canvas/tree/dec-21-dith..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This article seems to give RGB a bad rap but I think it makes the most sense for gradients. I wouldn&#39;t want a yellow to blue gradient to cycle through a (partial) rainbow of colors. But I also wouldn&#39;t really ever choose to make a pure yellow to pure blue gradient. Most pleasing gradients you see in the wild use colors that are more similar to begin with, so it&#39;s a bit of a strawman. It&#39;s really just about carefully choosing your start and end (and optionally intermediate) colors."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"There is a related video by minute physics about how the RGB color space stores the square root of the brightness of each color channel, because human color perception is roughly logarithmic. Bad color blending is therefore pretty commonplace because it uses the average of square roots instead of the square root of the average of the original brightness values. See: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LKnqECcg6Gw"</p>

Search engines fail in weird ways.I think in part that Google just has gotten a spectacularly confusing failure mode. If it can&#39;t find good matching contents, it starts second-guessing your query and producing other results, which makes you think it&#39;s not even considering what you entered. It may even be &#34;better&#34; in the sense that it&#39;s more likely to return at least something relevant, but in practice it&#39;s bad UX because it&#39;s so unintuitive what&#39;s happening. It&#39;s probably one of those unfortunate optimizations that are invisible when they work and frustrating when they don&#39;t.There is so much stuff on the Internet it&#39;s easy to start thinking there is guaranteed to be good results for any search, and that just doesn&#39;t seem to be the case. Especially with highly specified searches with 6-8 terms, you quickly enter the domain where you&#39;re reasonably unlikely to find an exact match."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"When I search for &#34;databricks series b valuation&#34; in Google (from Argentina, using Google.com in English) result #6 is:&#34;Python get value from database - Büro Jorge Schmidt&#34;, which judging by title and preview seems to be a Python + MySQL tutorial. It returns a 403 error and might be a hacked site, since the home page is for a graphic design studio in Munich.Result #8 is something similar:&#34;Intellij flatten packages - Músicos de Viaje&#34;. This is definitely a hacked site (from Spain, apparently) that redirects me somewhere else.Result #10:&#34;How to calculate tax percentage in sql query&#34;. Another hacked site, this time for an evangelical church from Brazil.Now... how can Google think that any of these sites are relevant? Even if it doesn&#39;t realize the pages are hacked... even its crawler has been fed content that included the keywords... :A - The sites themselves don&#39;t match the query at all.B - No legit site about the subject would link to these sites.C - The results themselves (title, url, preview), as Google shows them, have nothing to do with the search!"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The author is fighting a strawman. Rather than engage with the specific problems these solutions were built to solve they dismissively regard them as just flavor of the week trends purely for the sake of chasing newness. This is true of the entire post, but I&#39;ll tackle just one since it&#39;s emblematic of my issues with all the rest:The argument for Electron and React Native isn&#39;t &#34;it&#39;s modern&#34;, it&#39;s &#34;it&#39;s much cheaper&#34;. Hiring experienced desktop application devs to build a quality native app for each platform is going to be expensive, hiring a few JS bootcampers to build one react UI that works on every platform is extremely cheap - shittier performance is the tradeoff to instantly have access to every platform. It&#39;s not a coincidence that Electron apps like e.g. Slack, Spotify, Discord are massively dominant players in their markets, I doubt you&#39;d look the engineering leads of these companies in the face and tell them that you believe they put no thought into the tradeoffs of Electron and that they&#39;re just following trends."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I feel comfortable with asserting that the author has never worked on a complex web application. This web-dev hate borders on pathological: this is a guy that seems to specialize in Unix/Linux tooling, doesn&#39;t have a single tutorial on web app development [1], and yet has an intense hatred towards a space that he barely understands.These types of arguments are incredibly embarrassing to read, not only because they betray a stunning lack of familiarity with the topic, but it&#39;s basically a conspiracy theory: everybody is stupid except me, all these successful companies making billions of dollars and attracting top talent are just throwing money into a fire for fun.[1] https://unixsheikh.com/tutorials.html"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;m a greybeard. I&#39;ve been doing this since before HTML existed, and I&#39;ve kept up with the changes as they occurred along the way.I&#39;m not going to refute the author&#39;s points one by one. Everything being complained about exists for a reason. I agree that it&#39;s incredibly complex. It&#39;s overwhelming. That&#39;s why people specialize.An individual can still own an entire application and infrastructure, limit their technology choices to those from the 90s, and produce a perfectly functional, modern web application indistinguishable from anything using the latest tools and frameworks. It&#39;s a whole lot of work, though.If you take the time to learn some of the modern tools, they&#39;ll save you a lot of time. Why re-invent the wheel? But all these time-saving frameworks are complex, and learning all of them would take years, if you haven&#39;t been keeping up as they evolved. You can learn one or two of them quickly, though. You can specialize.That&#39;s why we have DevOps teams, UI teams, API teams, database teams. That&#39;s a lot of people. But that&#39;s what it takes if you want a high-performance web application that can scale to support hundreds of millions of users, is responsive around the world, supports a variety of languages, can handle disruptions, complies with regulations, and on and on. Don&#39;t need those things? Then stick with PHP and HTML on a server you run yourself. This isn&#39;t the 90s anymore. There are a lot of people out there, and if you&#39;re building something worth using, it&#39;s a different ballgame."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Meanwhile our idiot city (Oxford, UK) is spending £1.2m on &#34;Quickways&#34;, which are painted lines on existing roads... guaranteed to keep cyclists 0% safe. This in the face of national Government guidance in favour of physical segregation from cars. (Plans at https://letstalk.oxfordshire.gov.uk/quickway-cycle-route-oxf...: the promise of &#34;segregation where possible&#34; in reality means about 5% of the network.)It is really frustrating how highway engineers, as a profession, are unwilling to consistently learn lessons from the Netherlands in designing cycle infrastructure. Many cities seem to delight in half-assing their own solutions. So congratulations to Milan, who look like they may have got it right."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"If you live in a region where bike infrastructure is underfunded, and car infrastructure is overfunded, it’s probable that’s because cycling is viewed as a recreational activity in your area and thus undeserving of tax dollars compared to ‘essential’ car travel.If you disagree with that, (and live in a democracy) let someone know! Find out who controls the infrastructure spending in your area and call/email them."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"If any of you have been to Milan, the inner circle of the image [1] is more or less the city boundary. That path could be anything between 70 to 100 km according to how they&#39;ll design it. I had no problems cycling 100+ km around the city during the second quasi-lockdown of one winter ago.The grey area is what&#39;s called &#34;città metropolitana&#34; now, basically the old province of Milan including more than 100 of other cities. Milan accounts for almost half of the population.[1] Deep link to the bike paths network https://cdn.road.cc/sites/default/files/styles/main_width/pu..."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&gt; Turns out, you can’t. From what I could gather, the version of Chrome was tied to ChromeOS which couldn’t be updated because of the hardware. No new ChromeOS meant no new Chrome which meant stuck at version 76.This is the most surprising part of the article. If ChromeOS does not allow the browser to be updated after the hardware has reached end-of-support, I would recommend it to nobody, ever."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"A friend lent me a 2017 iPad that she&#39;s no longer using. I wanted to download Spotify, but couldn&#39;t, because I needed a newer version of iOS.The device does not get a new version of iOS, so I tried Safari to see if the web client works. Spotify&#39;s web client does not work on that version of Safari.So I tried downloading Firefox and Chrome, but I can&#39;t because they no longer support my version of iOS.So I looked for a way to download older versions of apps (Spotify, or an older version of Firefox or Chrome on which Spotify would still work). As it turns out, there&#39;s a way: you first need to &#34;purchase&#34; the app you&#39;re interested in on a newer device that supports the latest version. Then, you can log into your older device and download an older version of the same app.That means there&#39;s a way for me to run an older version of an app that works on my iPad, but nah, I need to first get a newer device and &#34;purchase&#34; it there.My conclusion: the onus is on the device manufacturers to not arbitrarily restrict their users. Jim Nielsen&#39;s mom&#39;s iPad is perfectly capable of opening that website, but its manufacturers are limiting it artificially."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The first line of the article is misleading. It&#39;s not just about a &#34;crappy laptop&#34;, it&#39;s about locked-down devices (ChromeOS, iPad) that have had their support terms expire. I suppose that is crappy, but it&#39;s not quite the image I&#39;d conjure myself.For various reasons but mainly because I so rarely use laptops, I have a crappy laptop from ca. 2010. It&#39;s slow, with a spinning-rust hard disk and an Intel Celeron from its day; it&#39;s a miracle it even allowed up to a 4GB RAM upgrade. With a GPU that can barely manage to process a 1366x768 framebuffer needed for the built-in screen, it&#39;s an unpleasant experience all around. By all means it&#39;s the definition of crappy laptop and that held even when the thing was new.All the same, it has no problem running Debian 11, and both the newest Chromium and Firefox can at least launch on it. It does take half a minute for the browser windows to actually appear, but it works, more or less. The per-site experience after this depends heavily on how much &#34;cool tech&#34; web site developers have opted to use. YouTube is practically unusable even in the tiny video window it displays and 360p videos. Hacker News is perfectly fine.Perhaps bias on my own part, but I would argue that this case is the crappy laptop that&#39;s reasonable to optimize for. It may not be pleasant, but for large classes of web sites, it should be bearable to some extent. I&#39;m pretty sure both the Chromebook and iPad mentioned in the article have better hardware specs than my thing, but they&#39;re both made by companies that are far too willing to drop support after a short period, leaving users in an insecure status and many of them just don&#39;t know why web sites stop working."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"My dad who passed away some years ago on my 50th birthday, worked on the design for the AGR for many, many years.

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I bet the Fukushima backup power system would have fit this explanation perfectly:&gt; in addition to the grid connection, there are four twelve megawatt diesel generator stations spaced around each corner of the plant -- each with two generators, any one of which is able to provide operating power to keep the reactor&#39;s safety systems working.Unfortunately for Fukushima, all generators were flooded by a single Tsunami. What are the odds of an unknown event that will affect all generators? Think of EMP, contaminated fuel, a large cloud of C)2 suffocating the engines... All seem highly unlikely, but how do you plan for the unknown unknowns?The most likely (and I think underestimated) risk for Nuclear plants is a systemic change due to a large (climate?) crisis and/or war. Think of the collapse of the Soviet Union, that definitely increased risk and reduced maintenance budget for a few Nuclear plants. Any significant sea level rise, drought or flood could very well trigger such events (even if the reactor is not affected directly, the society around it will be). That is why I think nuclear is a risky option to reach net-zero; every plant you build is a bet on the future stability of society for at least 75 years (time until the plant will be safely decommissioned by future generations). I would feel much safer in a world covered in solar panels, wind turbines and transmission lines (and highly variable spot pricing) than in one with nuclear plants that require constant care by experts and that even in the best case incur a huge cost on society to safely decommission.&gt; In 2016 the European Commission assessed that European Union&#39;s nuclear decommissioning liabilities were seriously underfunded by about 118 billion euros, with only 150 billion euros of earmarked assets to cover 268 billion euros of expected decommissioning costs covering both dismantling of nuclear plants and storage of radioactive parts and waste. France had the largest shortfall with only 23 billion euros of earmarked assets to cover 74 billion euros of expected costs  [1][1] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_decommissioning"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"French power grid agency RTE made a report[0] forecasting 2050 France energy mix, and because of loss of knowledge and increased security measures, even with strong political will, France won&#39;t be able to maintain its 70% nuclear power electricity share.
Most nuclear-intensive scenario in this report is max 50% nuclear energy.[0]https://assets.rte-france.com/prod/public/2021-12/Futurs-Ene... in french"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">" Not very surprised.An Indian expat living in NL, with parents living back home in India. My (retired, old) parents are afraid to get tested for COVID because they hear way too many incidents from their neighbourhood about “hospitals faking COVID test results just so that they can admit them for 4 days, administer expensive drugs, charge them some hefty bill, and send home”. As stupid as it sounds, I could not force my parents to go and wait in the line to get COVID test, after he says “I believe I don’t have COVID now. But if I go to the testing center that is so badly managed and understaffed where only people with obvious high level of COVID are brought to get official result, I will get COVID there!”.Say what you will, but if the basic trust in doctors and healthcare is lost, how would people get tested, and how can you trust any statistics from there?!I’m ashamed, stupefied and angry at the same time."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Excess deaths will need to become the standard statistic used to compare nations.  Otherwise, we&#39;ll be debating &#34;deaths FROM vs. deaths WITH COVID&#34; and the differing statistical definitions from nation to nation.  Moreover, is a death from lack of access to medical care due to the collapse of a medical system a COVID death?  Is a death of despair from isolation and unemployment a COVID death?My sense is, when the pandemic is analyzed historically, &#34;excess deaths&#34; will be the only salient statistic in the literature."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"India desperately needs a public institution like the NHS of the UK!Few years ago my father died of ILD(Interstitial Lung Disease), as per the doctors. I had my doubts about the diagnosis, but I had no where to go to for second opinion. There is a private hospital syndicate in every city of India; no hospital goes against other hospitals in the same city; they will cover each others back because most of the hospitals have the same &#34;consulting doctors&#34;. They just loot the patient&#39;s relatives by prescribing same drug but from different manufacturer. And if they realise that the patient is going to die, then the family members are pressured to take the patient home or elsewhere, this is to avoid &#34;death count&#34; on their register. I was literally asked to take my father home the day he died suggesting that &#34;take him home, we will provide the ambulance and he will die on the way home so it won&#39;t be on anyone of us!&#34;The medicine profession in India is not just joke, it is inhumane and lacks any value for humanity.India should have looked at some of the European countries when setting up it&#39;s healthcare, education and news media policy. Unfortunately the country has copied verbatim everything in this regard from the US!"</p>

Turns out it&#39;s donations, and now I&#39;m a donor through monthly charges through the mobile app.  I actually opted for that specifically because their web site noted that they can&#39;t give you a badge in the app if you donate online, and I thought showing the badge would be a good way for other people to see and inquire about, and hopefully realize they can donate too if they care to."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I&#39;m currently in the W22 batch. There&#39;s some heavy skepticism in this thread, so I want to add perspective from someone actually in the current batch (throwaway because we haven&#39;t announced our funding yet).The additional $375k (+$125k OG deal = $500k) that YC is offering is an optional and uncapped SAFE. I think of this as YC being an investor in our next round, except I can receive and deploy the cash now with no premium paid to YC. This is extremely founder friendly, and is in addition to what YC had already agreed to invest in us. The terms on this SAFE are much better than what I could have negotiated on my own, and it comes with zero fundraising effort.Because of this, I&#39;m able to go into pitch meetings with investors around demo day in March with more leverage – I no longer need capital from them to keep the company moving in the short term. I can also make capital intensive moves I otherwise would have waited to do.As to whether YC is a value add for us with the dilution it incurs: yes, absolutely. The valuation cap we&#39;re raising at has doubled, we have access to a great network of people and companies (this has a real and significant effect), and we were able to convince someone with the YC funding to leave their stable and well paying job to join us.This is all in the context of a US based developer tools startup that already has a top-tier university signal (Stanford), co-founders with FAANG offers on the table, and a co-founder with years of experience working (but not as a founder) at two startups that were acquired.I&#39;m sure some others have better fundraising opportunities, but there is a reason many founders like myself still choose to go through YC."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This makes it much easier to get to profitability[0] and never raise again after YC (especially as a SaaS). I wonder how this will impact the decision to raise money after YC.0 - Including paying the founders a reasonable salary"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The entire reason I didn&#39;t apply last season was because despite being my startup looking for funding, and despite us having our best traction to date (functional MVP deployed in big retail partner, making sales) - the $125k (minus the cost of uprooting our team and product to CA) was just a bad deal. We&#39;ve been in talks with some angel groups with 500K being the ask for the pre-seed, and that has been well received. So I think 500K is right on the money for now. It&#39;s a good change to see!"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This just in:Verizon, AT&amp;T and T-Mobile say they’re not blocking Apple’s iCloud Private Relay - https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=29901056"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I would think Apple has some leverage to force it if they really wanted.If Apple really wanted to force the issue, they could tell T-Mobile no more iPhone contracts unless you do it. Apple can survive and thrive on fewer networks - the iPhone was AT&amp;T exclusive for a long time at the beginning.If that happened, there would be no way for T-Mobile to get a supply of iPhones. People would need to buy iPhones from Apple and then replace the SIM cards themselves. It would make T-Mobile bend pretty quickly unless they managed to get Verizon and AT&amp;T to join them on the issue.But then Apple has a second card to play, and that&#39;s the court of public opinion. If Apple wanted to make a public ad lambasting the carriers for undermining people&#39;s privacy, the damage would also force them to bend.Finally, of course, there&#39;s the fact that carriers need Apple just as much as Apple needs carriers. However, between the carriers and Apple, who has $200 billion in the bank to do things themselves if they wanted?Edit: Heck, T-Mobile has a market value of $130 billion. AT&amp;T has a market cap of $188B, and Verizon $223 billion. If Verizon and AT&amp;T joined T-Mobile in protest, Apple could theoretically attempt (or at least threaten) a hostile takeover of any of them. That would cause a lot of discussion among the carriers and send a strong message very quickly."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I think you should avoid T-Mobile if you can. Not just as a matter of principle, but also pragmatism. They have an extremely crude SMS censorship/anti-spam system [1] which even blocks links to lichess.org, the popular online chess website.They have poor security practices like storing passwords in plaintext [2], and they had a large data breach (probably about 100M customers affected) last year. [3]A̶n̶d̶ ̶n̶o̶w̶,̶ ̶i̶t̶ ̶s̶e̶e̶m̶s̶ ̶t̶h̶e̶y̶ ̶a̶r̶e̶ ̶t̶h̶r̶o̶w̶i̶n̶g̶ ̶i̶n̶ ̶s̶o̶m̶e̶ ̶p̶r̶o̶t̶o̶c̶o̶l̶ ̶b̶l̶o̶c̶k̶i̶n̶g̶ ̶t̶o̶o̶.̶PS: This isn&#39;t protocol blocking at the packet/port level, so I may have used &#34;protocol blocking&#34; a bit inappropriately. Apparently Apple allows the carriers to prevent people from enabling iCloud Private Relay, and T-Mobile is doing that. Apple is probably doing so due to the pressure by the carriers. In August, four carriers (Vodafone, Telefonica, Orange and T-Mobile ) signed a letter urging the European Commission to stop Apple from providing Private Relay. (According to a report by The Telegraph: https://archive.fo/BRUS4#selection-915.74-925.194) This, of course, still quite preposterous.[1]: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=29744347[2]: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=16776347[3]: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=28192423 (The first comment by @jonathanmayer has a list of other recent T-Mobile security incidents)"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I have been working as an ML Engineer for a few years now and I am baffled by the bar to entry for these positions in the industry.Not only I need to perform at the Software Engineer level expected for the position (with your standard leetcode style interviews), but I need to pass extra ML specific (theory and practice) rounds. Meanwhile the vast majority of my work consist of getting systems production ready and hunting bugs.If I have to jump through so many hoops when changing jobs I&#39;ll seriously consider a regular non-ML position."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This book has fun problems! Example:During the cold war, the U.S.A developed a speech to text (STT) algorithm that could theoretically detect the hidden dialects of Russian sleeper agents. These agents (Fig. 3.7), were trained to speak English in Russia and subsequently sent to the US to gather intelligence. The FBI was able to apprehend ten such hidden Russian spies and accused them of being &#34;sleeper&#34; agents.The Algorithm relied on the acoustic properties of Russian pronunciation of the word (v-o-k-s-a-l) which was borrowed from English V-a-u-x-h-a-l-l. It was alleged that it is impossible for Russians to completely hide their accent and hence when a Russian would say V-a-u-x-h-a-l-l, the algorithm would yield the text &#34;v-o-k-s-a-l&#34;. To test the algorithm at a diplomatic gathering where 20% of participants are Sleeper agents and the rest Americans, a data scientist randomly chooses a person and asks him to say V-a-u-x-h-a-l-l. A single letter is then chosen randomly from the word that was generated by the algorithm, which is observed to be an &#34;l&#34;. What is the probability that the person is indeed a Russian sleeper agent?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The ML/DS positions highly competitive these days. I don&#39;t get why ML positions requires hard preparations for the interviews more than other CS positions while you do similar things. People expect you to know a lot of theory from statistics, probability, algorithms to linear algebra. I am ok with knowing basic of these topics which are the foundations of ML and DL. But I don&#39;t get to ask eigenvectors and challenging algorithm problems in an ML Engineering position at the same while you already proof yourself with a Masters Degree and enough professional experience. I am not defending my PhD there. We will just build some DL models, maybe we will read some DL papers and maybe try to implement some of those. The theory is the only 10% of the job, rest is engineering, data cleaning etc. Honestly I am looking for the soft way to get back to Software Engineering."</p>

I don&#39;t know, but forever ago I wrote software for a cardiovascular imaging lab and pigs were their primary test subjects. I was like, &#34;why pigs?&#34; and the PI was like, &#34;Imaging-wise, pig hearts aren&#39;t too different from humans. Plus, we can give them a heart attack in the scanner and not go to jail. Some labs use dogs. I just can&#39;t do that.&#34;"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"The pig was modified to remove presentation of immunogenic sugars on the cell surface. Unfortunately, the recipient needs to be on immunosuppressants the rest of their life.This rekindles discussions back in school about chimeras... in order for the organs to be immunocompatible, the donor needs to be partially human. What % is too human to harvest for organs?I suppose it&#39;s still too soon to answer such questions, but apparently, 0% acceptable."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"In my first corporate job out of college (a NOC at an ISP) I was asked to update the documentation for troubleshooting quality of service issues. I checked our wiki for what was already there and it horrendous. I started to mentally thrash the person and was going to go confront them about it. When I checked the edit history I was greeted by a single edit and my username a week after I started the job.I learned a great deal of humility and compassion in that moment."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"On the topic of &#34;who wrote this shit&#34;, I&#39;d really like to plug the idea that some of the most high-impact documentation you can write is a good commit message.Say you track down a bug, find a line of code that makes no sense, and `git blame` it, to discover that you wrote it yourself, 2 years ago. If the commit message is &#34;bugfix flaky builds&#34;, good luck figuring it out.If the commit subject rather, is &#34;bugfix flaky builds&#34;, followed by a message that explains what the flakiness was, why you think the change will fix it, what other bugs or limitations you were working around, and what upstream changes you might be waiting on that prevented further work, you&#39;re in a much better position. Suddenly you have a lot more context on what you were doing, why you were doing it, why you didn&#39;t do it better at the time, and in some cases it can even catch you from making an obvious but subtly-wrong mis-step.Similarly, if someone&#39;s confused by your code during code review, that&#39;s a great opportunity for either in-line comments, or commit messages, as appropriate.Unlike PR discussions, tickets, emails, slack threads, wiki pages, or photos of whiteboards, commit messages + git blame has an uncanny ability to be exactly the documentation you need exactly when you need it. Good git history practice can be one of the highest returning investments."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Email is in a funny space. Spf showed up. And although it meant some political fights when people expected to send email from anywhere, it was free to run in the dollar sense. Same with dkim.Dmarc is increasingly required to get past spam filters. And doing dmarc properly requires a reporting service. Either you run servers or use a hosted service like the one that created this page. That&#39;s fine for some business, but putting a cost on dmarc reporting and then making dmarc a heavy signal in spam filters is a huge pain for some scenarios.It&#39;s not highly expensive, but  on non monetized side projects it can frustrating how how much the internet expects you to have dmarc on every domain now."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Question for HN: how do you handle DMARC reports? We have an email where those are just pulling up in a S3 bucket. I was hoping to find an easy solution that unzips them, aggregates, visualizes, and alerts us (if necessary).In the meantime, I&#39;m hoping to avoid yet another subscription service.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I&#39;m vaxxed. I&#39;m boosted. I&#39;d very much like to be done. But my children cannot be vaccinated.As a parent of a young kid it kind of feels like everyone has just moved on. I know folks in here will tell me that statistically speaking my children are unlikely to be hospitalized and so on, and I agree. But I know enough kids who got COVID and suffered the symptoms (e.g. a months-long scratchy cough) that I&#39;m not going to stop worrying about it. We&#39;re still very unclear on the long-term effects of COVID, after all.Couple that to daycare/preschool shutdowns: if there&#39;s a case in the class we&#39;ve got to keep our kids at home for a week. We both work. We can deal with it, lord knows we&#39;ve had to do it enough times already, but it&#39;s absolutely draining. And the stress of waiting/expecting the phone call from the school is always there, particularly in this Omicron phase where it feels like everyone and their dog is contracting it. And this comes from two parents that work from home. We&#39;re the luckiest of the lot!Pfizer has already announced their trial with under 5s was not successful and they&#39;ll have to restart. Moderna was supposed to close out a trial in late November but instead expanded it to hundreds of new participants. Why? Unclear. Last I saw no-one seems to be covering it in detail. Out of sight, out of mind."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I feel like COVID has become like a marshmallow test for adults, where those who can manage their emotions and make rational decisions can set themselves up for greater long-term rewards.It looked for a while there like this could be a thing that gets “done”—that we would get a good vaccine into enough people, then incidence would decline so far it just goes away.That didn’t happen. We’re stuck with it for a foreseeable future. Well, one can cry for the world that was, or one can get up and live in the world that is.We’re not going to be done with vaccines and mandates. And that does not have to be a big deal. I have had to prove vaccination status of my kid for schools and camps for years. It’s annoying but not any harder than keeping my car registration up to date or any other minor bureaucratic headache.I know someone who almost quit a great job because they were mad about a vaccine mandate from their employer. They were going to give up a good salary, great benefits, and a stable career because they were “so over COVID.” That is what failing the marshmallow test looks like."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;ve gone through cycles with this. Mostly I am done arguing. I hate arguing about this. It&#39;s just more of the culture war shit that so many different media sources love pushing to keep people amped up.I double vaxxed and boosted. Stopped wearing a mask for the most part, but with Omicron I started wearing a mask again because I just don&#39;t want this stupid virus. I&#39;m healthy and would probably not have a symptomatic infection. But I still don&#39;t want this stupid virus, and I don&#39;t want to spread it.I think for 2022 I am going to try to argue less, and focus more on my areas of personal expertise. I&#39;ve done a lot of arguing and feel like I&#39;m generally worse off for it."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"When I was very young I worked a tough job that had a mandatory union and it was quite terrible / weak.  Working conditions were pretty bad, physical labor, etc.  But it was not until I worked a job with no union that I realized every element of that job that didn&#39;t suck was due to the union.  For example we had supervisors but they didn&#39;t follow you around and micromanage you.  You were just expected to do your job.  If you didn&#39;t you would be reprimanded of course, but no one was on your case at all.  Supervisors had to show you a base level of respect: there were rules on that stuff.  There were a lot of rules, actually, and even though the union didn&#39;t have a lot of power I&#39;m pretty sure every single positive one, anything that gave employees even a sliver of autonomy and power, were things that the union fought for and got for us.I still was kind of anti-union after that.  &#34;Anti Union&#34; is the wrong phrasing, it was more... I was very suspicious of their structure, their own profit motive(s) etc.  People working for the union had it so much better than the people actually doing the work, and we were the ones paying for and funding it, right?  That aspect of it I never got over, but I now think that it may have been the wrong point of view.I have recently come around full swing and am 100% pro union.  And it is stories like this.  Starbucks, Google, Amazon, these companies will spend millions to fight unions.  This is prima facie evidence to me that unions benefit workers.  These companies all talk the same talk: &#34;we believe companies work best when team members can work directly with the company with no union in the way&#34;.  As though Amazon warehouse workers have some kind of communication path to improve their working conditions when they are being managed and fired by an AI.  What a buncha fkn BS.Things cost.  Good things cost money.  You are paying for someone to fight for your interests and not the company&#39;s interest.  Maybe that is worth paying for.  And if you don&#39;t pay money to a union to fight you pay with your physical health, your safety, your respect, your mental health.  If you work for Amazon you pay with your life when they threaten to fire you if you try to leave in order to hide from a hurricane.  We should all be in unions."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"A lot of people seem confused why a lot of tech people aren&#39;t pushing for unions.For me it&#39;s simple: Tech has brought me from near poverty to pretty darn wealthy. Why mess with that?Could a union help increase wages even more? Maybe. Are we being paid too little compared to our output? Maybe. But at the same time I&#39;m being paid more than I could have possibly imagined before I entered the field."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"While my personal opinion is that, in today&#39;s age, many unions suck and that some industries need unions more than others, employers who even think they should psy-op their employees into action/inaction for the benefit of the employer should get screwed.I&#39;ve heard some great things about how Google does things differently to create a better workplace for engineers and employees in general, but I&#39;d seriously think thrice before taking a job there for many reasons including this one."</p>

If Upwork is the middleman here providing a payment platform, then I&#39;d expect them to swallow the cost of card fraud, not the freelancer. I suspect individual freelancers have a theoretical dollar value in their calculations and it&#39;s never going to be bigger than the company accepting a financial risk.I do wonder why the author is still on Upwork, their rating &amp; exposure on there must be worth more to them than working several weeks for free, but personally I&#39;d walk. I also don&#39;t understand why the pay back is not pro-rata instead of full time, allowing freelancers in this position to earn some money to pay the bills whilst paying back the chargeback (although they shouldn&#39;t be paying it at all). If the author is in the same country as the client then they should also be taking legal action to reclaim the money (which again, Upwork should be doing)."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The freelancer&#39;s story seems a little suspicious to me.&#34;Let me translate this. Robin has been using someone else’s credit card for two years...&#34; followed by &#34;I’m on very good terms with Robin.&#34;Clearly, &#39;Robin&#39; is a thief and it is entirely possible that Robin and the freelancer are one and the same. That the freelancer is not asking Robin for the money even though he knows him personally is telling.  Does the freelancer wonder what his good client Robin thinks about the fact that Robin ran up a 12K credit card bill(payable to the freelancer, ultimately) that Robin never paid?(And we know the bill was never paid or there would be no need for the claw-back)And I did not see any mention of where Upwork contacted Robin.  Strange considering he was the one with “a credit card connected in his account that wasn’t actually his”. Is he still on the platform?And then he sent two years worth of work to Upwork to substantiate his claim to the money. But how could Upwork know that the work he sent was legitimately related to the transaction?  Could he not have created a project request for something he had already built?Then he apparently logs ALL of his &#39;time&#39; outside of the system. He said that this time was for &#34;a brainstorming session and a few meetings&#34; with Robin. 230 hours worth!?  I notice that dates of the charge-back transactions were not provided. Was this 230 hours the entirety of the project or just a very small  slice. He wrote that he had made more that 100K on Upwork and that he had other clients.  That leads me to think that this 12K represented all or most of the billing on Robin&#39;s project. Was there any billing for actual implementation, or is it all brainstorming and meetings?This story does not add up to me.edit:  I see in the graphic that apparently the work on Robin&#39;s project was for 1533 hours, so the 230 hours would have been just a portion.  It makes me wonder what/how many other credit cards were used to pay for those other hours.  Hard to believe Robin was above board for the first 1303 hours and then started paying with a stolen credit card."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;d be looking to get &#34;Robin&#34; to put in writing that he used the wrong card. Surely it is Robin who owes Upwork, not OP who owes Upwork. I&#39;d also want Upwork to answer a few questions:1. Did the cardholder receive their money back?2. If so, how much exactly?3. How much of that amount did you receive, after 
fees?4. Is &#34;Robin&#34; still active on the Upwork platform?5. Do Upwork have the contact details of &#34;Robin&#34;?6. What actions have they taken to recover these costs from &#34;Robin&#34;?7. Who was the person whose card &#34;Robin&#34; had access to?8. Why did it take them so long to spot the charges?There are so many questions here. They can&#39;t just close the case. It&#39;s not a support ticket. This is a legal matter. If OP stops working right now, then he does pay the costs, but he does then have to find another income.For anyone wants to try and help OP, consider liking/retweeting this: https://twitter.com/imdsm/status/1480176898600845312"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; &#34;Looking further afield: it seems likely that the end of internal combustion engines will be in sight. Some countries are already scheduling a ban on IC engines to come in after 2030—electric cars are now a maturing technology with clear advantages in every respect except recharge time. Once those IC cars are no longer manufactured, we can expect a very rapid ramp-down of extraction and distribution industries for petrol and diesel fuels, leading to a complete phase-out possibly as early as 2040.&#34;At this point the proposed bans are on the sale of new vehicles that run on fossil fuels.  As far as I know, no one is planning to outright ban ICE vehicles yet.  Headline writers consistently get this wrong, because making the policy sound more extreme than it is attracts ad views.&gt; &#34;As about half of global shipping is engaged in the transport of petrochemicals or coal at this point, this is goin to have impacts far beyond the obvious.&#34;Huh, that&#39;s a lot.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This and more.  The Sail version of TeX is mentioned, but everything else had a usable prototype, too: An early version of Metafont in Sail, an early version of Web (called Doc, though I don’t recall what the names of the Tangle and Weave equivalents were), and an early version of Computer Modern fonts in the early Metafont language.Though fully documented and available via anonymous FTP on the Arpanet, all of these prototypes were experimental proofs-of-concept and were completely discarded, along with the languages they implemented, with the “real” versions rewritten from scratch by Knuth (each first by hand on legal pads, then typed in and debugged as a whole.)And you missed one more obscure but instructive example: To get the camera-ready copy for ACP Vol 2, Knuth purchased an Alphatype CRS phototypesetter. And, unhappy with the manufacturer’s firmware, he rewrote the 8080 code that drives the thing.  Eight simultaneous levels of interrupts coming from various subsystem: the horizontal and vertical step-motors that you had to accelerate just right, while keeping synchronized with four S100 boards that generated slices of each character in realtime from a proprietary outline format, to be flashed into the lens just as it was passing the right spot on the photo paper. (Four identical boards, since you had to fill the second while the first one did its processing; times two for two characters that might overlap due to kerning). Oh, and you had to handle memory management of the font character data since there wasn’t enough RAM for even one job’s worth (see our joint paper).Fun times. I did the driver on the mainframe side, so got to be there for the intense debugging sessions that used only the CRS’s 4x4 hex keypad and 12-character dot-matrix display.Thanks for the DVI shout-out, btw."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I think, though, that there was nothing preventing him from developing TeX in Fortran or something, and leaving it at that.  He is just somewhat easily distracted.  He nerd-snipes himself possibly.Yak Shaving is the frustrating work we do because of impedance mismatch in the system.  Libtool is a huge yak shave, for example.  But so is writing a custom CSV parser because an input file is just not quite accessible by the standard, and you could just use python to make the translation, but your environment won&#39;t let you use python in that spot, etc.  Days later nothing is really accomplished, you hate programming, and you can finally start work on the real problem after losing the motivation you had when you started.But I like the idea of a patron saint for this, and Knuth is as good as any.  Perhaps Dijkstra could be the patron saint of Unused Better Solutions.  I&#39;m sure there&#39;s a litany of things that could use saints in this field."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I follow the folks over at 100 rabbits (https://100r.co) and I think they’ve sort of developed yak shaving into a lifestyle.I don’t want to go too far into it cause the website is a treasure trove and exciting to explore on your own but if you follow some of their latest stuff, they’ve built a stack based virtual machine, and a whole set of software around it and it truly feels like they are just exploring every avenue that interests them without rushing themselves. Truly the embodiment of my grow a beard and learn Haskell dreams."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&gt; Hell, eleven percent of the energy that America currently uses, according to Saul Griffith’s excellent book Electrify, simply goes to finding more energy.That&#39;s a pretty shocking stat too!The energy transition is about to thrust us into a world where for long periods of time, we have massive energy abundance of zero-marginal cost energy generation. It won&#39;t be free to transmit that energy, and the intermittent nature of the abundance will play hell with most capital intensive uses (eg crypto mining), but I&#39;m super curious to see what new capabilities that people figure out for humanity."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The scoop: by tonnage, 40% of what is transported by sea is oil, coal, and LNG.By switching to local sources of energy (renewables mostly), humanity can seriously lower the impact of ships on the oceans, and stop burning as much fuel to move them, too.I&#39;d like to add that all these fuels are very energy-dense. Producing as much energy locally would not be an easy or inexpensive enterprise."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"My nitpicking brain immediately stumbled over these two consecutive sentences:&gt; something very close to forty percent of all the shipping on earth is just devoted to getting oil and coal and gas (and now some wood pellets) back and forth across the ocean.Wood pellets are not fossil fuels though...&gt; That’s a remarkable snapshot: almost half of what we move around the seas is not finished products (cars) nor even the raw materials to make them (steel), but simply the stuff that we burn to power those transformations, and to keep ourselves warmed, cooled, and lit.Oil is also a raw material, e.g. to make plastic. Not sure about what percentage is used as raw material vs. how much is used for fuel..."</p>

It brings down the RRP of the printer, thereby making it look more competitive than it really is.It is a risk that users might not buy your cartridges. That is a risk these manufacturers accept when they sell their product below market value.Loading up your printer with DRM is having your cake and eating it. It is anti-competitive and ought be outlawed. Either sell the unit at the real price you want to get from it, or accept the risk that your get rich scheme might not work."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This pandemic is very strange mental-wise, all my doctors note that. The US, as far as I understand, has huge lockdowns and that may be the factor, but in my country it&#39;s called &#34;an advisory self-isolation&#34; and everyone basically lives their life like before, except wearing masks in public places and mandatory vaccination to visit a mall or a restaurant (also &#34;manageable&#34;).I&#39;m not a social person (age almost 40), and I ought not to feel any consequences of that, cause even a strict lockdown wouldn&#39;t change my life too much. And I have a friend who isn&#39;t particularly stress-prone (a former warzone guy, 4 kids, a strong mindset).And guess what, we both experienced numerous acute panic attacks in 2020, without realizing what it was. We both have called an ambulance and thought this is the end of me, only to learn later what panic attack is. And we both never got covid. Doctors say that it is a very common phenomenon to observe. Idk about him, but my mental state I find pretty questionable now, because something induces anxiety in it non-stop from the spring 2020. I don&#39;t watch TV, neither read on pandemic situation consciously. Visited therapist for a whole last year.I can imagine what all that does to regular people, and probably can&#39;t imagine what teens may feel about it.Can anyone share similar observations, or am I just a coincidence?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The US policy response has been far more costly and destructive than it needed to be.The pandemic response completely ignored the costs of shutdowns.  There has been little or no consideration of their impact on physical health, mental health, education, business, employment, worship.  It has been as if COVID was the only risk and the only negative, and any other matter was necessarily secondary.  To even mention these matters was considered obtuse.We have also exaggerated the risks.  The disease has a 0.3 risk of fatality, still less for Omicron, and its fatalities largely occur among people with known risk factors.  Children are essentially immune from serious effects, but this has been ignored by policy.ETA: At some point we need a serious reckoning of how we, as a society, mishandled this so badly.  I think we&#39;ll find the mistakes we&#39;ve made aren&#39;t made on COVID only."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;m not even a parent, but I&#39;ve been incredibly distressed by this trend. Several of my good friends have had their daughters attempt suicide (luckily, none have succeeded, although 2 extremely close calls). It&#39;s been utterly gut-wrenching to watch these talented, kind, ambitious girls spiral into shells of their former selves.Luckily, all my friends are fellow techies who are upper-middle class, and can afford medication and therapy (and in one case, out-of-state long-term hospitalization.) But even with insurance, they&#39;re looking at many thousands of dollars of treatment.It makes me sick to my stomach to think of all the lower-class parents who are terrified of their kids killing themselves, but can&#39;t afford therapy or psychiatry visits, and can&#39;t get pro-bono help (apparently the wait lists are several months long in many cities.)It&#39;s past time the West reckons with our mental health crisis. Why is it that we&#39;re the wealthiest nations in the world, yet our kids are more stressed and depressed than kids in third-world countries? I think society will only become more and more unstable until we spend time seriously addressing that question and adjust our culture accordingly."</p>

The driver and my SE are dressed super casual, the sales guy and I both have sport coats and are dressed just well enough to look &#34;important&#34;. Tour bus comes by with the driver doing their spiel and I see a few people looking at us trying to figure out who we are.  I wave to the bus and smile, a couple of people point, and then about 30 people all point their cameras at us and start snapping pics.  It&#39;s worth mentioning that the overall makeup of the group looks like a lot of people here on vacation from other countries. I can only imagine those people going back and looking at their pics and trying to figure out who they took pictures of."</p>

He blushed and said he had worked on it for nine years. I know spending a long time writing something doesn’t guarantee success. But not giving up on a good idea almost always does."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"A number of moons ago, I switched from a company that used IRC for its internal, real-time, ephemeral communication needs to an enterprise shop that used Microsoft Teams to do that (and of course other communication stuff, as the boundaries for what was better kept in Sharepoint, Confluence, Email/Exchange, the legacy Wiki, and/or Teams were never quite clear :)) there.In the old shop, we eventually had all kinds of important subsystems hooked up to our internal IRC server: Monitoring and alerting. Source control and Wiki activity. The deployment pipeline. Ticket activity reports. All these services were pretty much effortlessly set up to provide useful, real-time status information broadcast to topic-specific channels users could idle in. Everyone could stay informed on topics of their interest, in real time, with no barrier to entry. It was really good, and the implementation completed in a few hours total, for all use-cases, due to irc&#39;s incredible simplicity.Due to the benefits I had reaped from that setup before, I tried to implement parts of it on/for the MS Teams platform at the then-new job. Getting the Teams Python SDK to implement a bot-like entity running alone proved to be a days-long ordeal, and whatever followed wasn&#39;t much more pleasant.In the end, we let someone set up two email-to-teams-channel-forwards which kinda worked, but suffered from obnoxious, multi-minute relay delays.As a consequence of the tedious bringup and the latency shortcoming, the &#34;effortless notification&#34; initiative never really got traction.Not only because of this particular experience I am a firm believer that software/system simplicity is a virtue that can neither be overstated in importance, nor substituted by anything else."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"It’s a real shame how difficult programming is. I don’t mean that it is difficult to write difficult things, but that it is difficult to write simple things. Once upon a time, one could download visual studio, click about to make a new project in (e.g.) Visual Basic, draw a gui in the gui editor, and click the run button. One could then start adding simple functionality (e.g. working through a book). Or even longer ago when a computer might dump you practically straight into BASIC when you turned it on or you might get access to a mainframe/minicomputer with programming tools already set up. Nowadays, an ‘easy’ introduction could involve the horrific process of installing and setting up python on windows (where it is hard to do things other than input/output text) or editing some html/JavaScript files where there are more easily possible interactive things but lots of things are difficult like ‘just drawing things’ or anything that requires a server side.P.S. if you, like me, were wondering what Libera Chat is, it’s the moral successor of Freenode with Freenode now being a shell of its former self."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"As an aside, can I just say how refreshing this website is? It&#39;s 100% content, just text. Now view the html source, and be amazed. I daresay the author actually wrote the html by hand. I suppose it could be a very conservative and conscientious site generator that even respects line length, but I&#39;d be surprised. Short css file for minimal style tweaks, and readable markup. Fitting that the article is about simplicity. When I first learned html (late 90s) this is what it looked like. Very nice."</p>

It&#39;s sooo much more than that! It&#39;s a lightweight terminal editor with one of the largest, if not the largest ecosystems of pioneering extensions. It really shouldn&#39;t be weird that you&#39;d want to take advantage of all that without having to submit to the religion of modal editing.1. https://github.com/tombh/novim-mode"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"From the help pages[0] to help you navigate in this mode:&gt; These Insert mode commands will be useful:&gt; - Use the cursor keys to move around.&gt; - Use CTRL-O to execute one Normal mode command.  When this is a mapping, it is executed as if &#39;insertmode&#39; was off.&gt; - Use CTRL-L to execute a number of Normal mode commands, then use&lt;Esc&gt; to get back to Insert mode.&gt;These items change when &#39;insertmode&#39; is set:&gt; - when starting to edit of a file, Vim goes to Insert mode.&gt; - &lt;Esc&gt; in Insert mode is a no-op and beeps.&gt; - &lt;Esc&gt; in Normal mode makes Vim go to Insert mode.&gt; - CTRL-L in Insert mode is a command, it is not inserted.&gt; - CTRL-Z in Insert mode suspends Vim.I was going to call you out for plagiarizing an idea from a Reddit post[1] as your own, but it turns out you&#39;re the same person, so carry on :)[0]: https://vimhelp.org/options.txt.html#%27insertmode%27[1]: https://old.reddit.com/r/vim/comments/rxedpj/vim_prank_alias..."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I&#39;ve been working on BookStack for over 6 years now, learning a lot about open source project maintainership during that time. Originally developed it while looking for a documentation system for my mixed-technical-skill workplace. Wanted something easy to use without having to get finance involved when increasing our user count.With Confluence backing away from their self-hosted offerings, hopefully many will find BookStack useful. It&#39;s not supposed to be a direct replacement, and the design &amp; content structure is quite opinionated, but it can serve many of the same use-cases as Confluence had served."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Glad to see any alternatives to confluence (or Atlassian in general). I&#39;ve used Confluence for a good 4 years or so and for the life of me, I can not fathom why anyone would use this for storing documentation for code etc, as opposed to storing things direct in a repo. I can understand it&#39;s use somewhat for business folks, but even then, the way of organising things is abysmal, every solution (such as rich text editing) feels very off the shelf/MVP, uninspiring UI, the list goes on. It feels like most companies that use it already use the Atlassian stack of JIRA/Bitbucket, then feel the need to tack Confluence onto the end because it&#39;s there."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I remember considering BookStack while looking for a (surprise) replacement for Confluence.The main thing that led me to stop considering it pretty quickly is precisely the concept of books - I find it both unnecessarily complicated and unnecessarily limiting.My Org now uses DokuWiki. It has a lot of issues (the prosemirror visual editor is a good start, but in beta and out of development, for example). But it&#39;s also the least sucking option I&#39;ve found. Most Wiki software severely screws up the editing experience, which may not be such a good idea when you want to get people to document things. I&#39;m glad Bookstack does this right."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"That sounds like a major, incredibly dangerous update to the DB driver. Their 7.1, 7.2, 7.3 versions seem to all have breaking changes [1].Yet they are in obvious violation of SemVer expectations, which they declare to follow [2]:&gt; Mongoid follows versioning guidelines as outlined by the Semantic Versioning Specification, so you can expect only backwards incompatible changes in major versions [sic][1] https://docs.mongodb.com/mongoid/current/tutorials/mongoid-u...[2] https://mongoid.github.io/old/en/mongoid/docs/upgrading.html"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Mongoid docs[1] seem to be pretty cool about this change:&#34;As of Mongoid 7.1, logical operators (and, or, nor and not) have been changed to have the the same semantics as those of ActiveRecord. To obtain the semantics of or as it behaved in Mongoid 7.0 and earlier, use any_of which is described below.&#34;Is it just me or is this one of the most terrible breaking changes in a popular, official library ever?[1] https://docs.mongodb.com/mongoid/current/tutorials/mongoid-q..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"We use Mongoid. I treat every upgrade, no matter how small as its own piece of work involving going through the changelogs with a fine-tooth comb. This particular issue got flagged up when we last looked at upgrading. Currently Mongoid upgrades are stalled until we have the time to figure out the impact of some of their more egregious changes.I have a generally low trust approach to all dependency upgrades, irrespective of how minor they are, I&#39;ve been bitten by enough &#34;minor&#34; changes. But I treat Mongoid as an active adversary who is setting out to break things with every update.It&#39;s the complete opposite approach to that of the Rails core team and those that work on ActiveRecord (as the nearest equivalent to Mongoid). Changes to Rails core are always well flagged with really good advance warning of upcoming breaking changes, frequently with deprecation warnings several versions in advance. There just seems to be a core culture of thought and care towards their users."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Freddie de Boer just wrote something on his Substack about this - https://freddiedeboer.substack.com/p/many-kids-dont-have-a-w...The quick takeaway is that school is that for the most vulnerable kids, school is about a lot more than education. Taking school away from those kids can be much more damaging than many people realize.It seems to me like that right strategy would be to just say something like:    We encourage all kids to stay home, but if you can&#39;t, that&#39;s ok. You can come to school and have a warm, quiet place to spend the day, and we&#39;ll provide free lunch to everyone who comes.

Forget about the education piece for a while, just provide the (very important for some people) day care part."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I read this post earlier today, and found it quite shocking. I really hope this is an exception rather than the normal.I previously didn&#39;t think about it this way, and thought closing schools was the more sensible choice. But we&#39;re failing a whole generation like this.It more and more feels like we live in a society that sarcrifices their young, just to keep old people on their life support machines a little longer.Yeah, that&#39;s hyperbole. I don&#39;t know what&#39;s the right path, tbh."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I think I&#39;m getting something different from this than what the author intended.* They mention their study hall as a &#34;super spreader event&#34;.  This feels...hysterical to me.  Not just because it worries me that this kid is thinking about this in the way they are, but also because it&#39;s wrong.  The risk this person faces is much more likely from the HVAC system in the school, not the study hall.* The way they talk about the other kid asking questions &#34;with their mask down&#34;.  To be obsessed with this sort of minutiae as a kid is scary to me.* Kids thinking about test...and apparently being given something like 5 tests in a single day?  This seems wasteful and hysterical on behalf of the school.* Begin upset at kids for taking these tests in the bathroom instead of at home.It just seems like there is a whole realm of paranoia that this kid is trying to fit on top of their life, and I don&#39;t think this sort of paranoia is in any way reasonable.I think that teaching kids to think about their world with this framing, and at a formative age, is and already has done major damage to their development."</p>

More relevant results than either DDG or Google and a great presentation (like showing snippets from accepted or upvoted SO answers)And I have not even played around with advanced filters like lenses (which people in their discord seem to love).Negatives: So far, I’d say only that the widgets are less usable than DDGs.I had low expectations, but I’m really very positively surprised."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I grew up in the late 90ies with internet in Switzerland, and as a broke pre-teen and teenager I was used to getting EVERYTHING pirated and this habit sticked with me, even though when in later years I was working as a software developer.Torrenting, sharing with friends and family is still completely legal in Switzerland.Only after pay services like spotify became a thing and were more convenient than managing and tagging my multi TB sized aac/mp3 library, I switched.Same for Netflix. But since fragmentation of streaming services started to happen, I&#39;m going back to things like stremio/torrents/DDL sites.For software, as a hobbyist videographer I wouldn&#39;t purchase the Adobe suite and all the expensive VFX tools I use for my family videos. But whatever software I use professionally (at work and at my employer), I&#39;m of course getting proper licenses."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I subscribe to Netflix, Disney+ and Amazon (although that&#39;s just a byproduct of prime), and am happy to continue paying ~£30/month (which is roughly what a basic Cable package would cost me), and even pay the occasional £20 one off for a digital purchase of a &#34;cinema&#34; movie (see: Disney+&#39;s recent releases, new bond movie etc).However, when studios resort to pulling tricks like [0], artificially limiting content (john wick 2 is available on netflix, but to watch the first, you have to purchase it on another service), or just being fragmented (which of the 5 apps on my PC has the content I&#39;m looking for?) I start to get super frustrated at the services, and if this continues will either likely just stop paying for the content, or look elsewhere. The content needs to be easily accessible in high quality or it&#39;s going to lose to piracy.[0] https://www.digitalspy.com/movies/a37170236/black-widow-scar..."</p>

I remember winter getting only a few hours of daylight where the sun would merely peek over the horizon for part of the afternoon.  Looking at Iceland through this map, I was able to tell that some parts have hills to their south and during winter, they&#39;ll never leave the shadows.Of course, go just a little more North, and during the summer, the sun never sets.  It just circles the horizon."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The high-level goals of python end up creating these little syntactic landmines that can get even experienced coders. My personal nomination for the worst one of these is that having a comma after a single value often (depending on the surrounding syntax) creates a tuple. It&#39;s easy to miss and creates maddening errors where nothing works how you expect.I&#39;ve moved away from working in Python in general, but I think the #1 feature I want in the core of the language is the ability to make violating type hints an exception[1]. The core team has been slowly integrating type information, but it feels like they have really struggled to articulate a vision about what type information is &#34;for&#34; in the core ecosystem. I think a little more opinion from them would go a long way to ecosystem health.[1] I know there are libraries that do this, I am not seeking recommendations."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"For those looking to avoid this specific problem, there is a flake8 rule: https://pypi.org/project/flake8-no-implicit-concat.More broadly, the https://codereview.doctors makers are making the point that their tool caught an easy-to-miss issue that most wouldn&#39;t think to add a rule for. A bit of an open question to me how many of those there really are at the language level, but still seems like a neat project."</p>

I really appreciate mixture of &#34;but there are still servers&#34;, not being able to stop a gold rush, and (refreshingly) the technical take on the implementation details.It stands in such stark contrast to other content. For example, a web3 chat app announcement I saw yesterday [1]. I even joined the Discord to learn more and just found...hype.I found this parenthetical to be amusing:&gt; (visualizing this financial structure would resemble something similar to a pyramid shape)Pyramid-shaped financial setups indeed :).[1] https://twitter.com/MessagePartyApp/status/14791510011813765..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt;When you think about it, OpenSea would actually be much “better” in the immediate sense if all the web3 parts were gone. It would be faster, cheaper for everyone, and easier to use.That sums up the situation for me. Having a marketplace for purely digital goods might be a concept with a future. Having standard ways to interoperate between different platforms and query and update these goods might make sense (although I still think it goes opposite to the general trend of walled gardens vs. decentralized web, I don&#39;t see why the IP owners would play ball and accept the loss of control).The thing is that in most case those NFTs wouldn&#39;t be trustless. I see people putting forward that a use case would be an NFT that proves that your Rolex is real, or for Fortnite skins, or for the ownership of your house. But in all these situations, there&#39;s a very clear authority (Rolex, Epic Games and the municipal authorities, respectively). These authorities will be allowed to mint new NFTs at will (because who else?) and as such have to be trusted. That opens up interesting questions btw, like &#34;who is Rolex exactly?&#34; which creates a chain of custody of trusted authority involving trademark management among other things. But I digress.But then as soon as an authority is identified, why bother with the extreme overhead (it terms of resources and costs) of blockchain tech? Couldn&#39;t Rolex issue a PGP signed CSV of all valid Rolex serial numbers once a month on IPFS and you&#39;d get the exact same security and trust profile without having to involve any &#34;web3&#34; feature?Like cryptocurrencies, the subset of problems that can only be solved using NFTs is incredibly tiny and speculators rush to make up use cases that, if you think about it for five minutes, clearly make no sense and could be better solved using good old centralized tech."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I love syncthing as much as the next guy on here, but this article feels very much like &#34;why doesn&#39;t this square peg fit my round hole?!&#34; Dropbox (and iCloud) are meant more for cloud file storage than pure device-to-device synce. I couldn&#39;t go to a less tech savvy friend and say, &#34;Oh, you use Dropbox for backups? Here, use syncthing instead!&#34; For one, most people don&#39;t have multiple computers they want to keep in sync, and even if they do it&#39;s unlikely that those multiple computers have overlapping periods of being online, which syncthing will need to keep back ups!The author&#39;s baffling reaction to iCloud and Dropbox&#39;s warning just makes my point. Those warnings are super clear to people who use those services for backup - remove this file and it won&#39;t be backed up, hence not available elsewhere. That isn&#39;t those platforms begging for attention (???). Remove those warnings and see how many normies complain to Apple/Dropbox that they didn&#39;t know removing a file from their synced folder meant it wouldn&#39;t be synced anymore. This also applies to the bizarre complaint about cloud storage space limits - of course you need storage space on the service if those files have to live elsewhere!"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;ve been using Syncthing for about a year now, with multiple computers, and it&#39;s fantastic.Dropbox has become a real pain over the years (I&#39;ve also been a paid Dropbox customer for a long time):* adding bloat and features that I don&#39;t want or need* constantly nagging me for upgrades* lying that the admin password is required (it isn&#39;t)* consuming large amounts of CPU when anything changes anywhere in the filesystemIf Dropbox had a subscription plan where I could pay to get just the basic file sync functionality, with no nagging, no prompting, and optimized CPU usage, I would be happy to hand over my money. But it seems the company is run by the marketing team now.I highly recommend syncthing as a very, very capable replacement."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Hey everyone, glad you all are enjoying the project!To address some of the points I&#39;m seeing, it&#39;s not perfect right now, which is why we&#39;ve considered this a beta release. In particular, there are some issues around name coverage abroad and around engineered features (dams, canals, etc.). A lot of known issues are documented at the top of this page: https://ksonda.github.io/global-river-runner/. Ultimately, we made as much progress as we could, including a lot of manual name suggestions before launching, and decided to publish the tool in beta, with an understanding that we&#39;d take suggestions and otherwise work to improve the tool/data over time.To the points about the distance the paths are starting from a click, it does round coordinates to some extent. As much as I&#39;d like to be more exact, we&#39;re stuck with a limited number of &#34;flowlines&#34; in our dataset and it will look for the closest one, which isn&#39;t always as close as we&#39;d like. It&#39;s most useful for understanding watersheds in broad strokes, but often falls a little short when it comes to the novelty of literally tracing from your address.For both specificity and some of the canal issues, the US-only version of this tool is better than this one (https://river-runner.samlearner.com/) with the obvious limitation that the paths are only within the US.If you have any issues/feedback/suggestions regarding the UI and have a minute, would really appreciate if you&#39;re able to submit them as issues in the project repo on Github: https://github.com/sdl60660/river-runner If you&#39;re experiencing routing/naming issues, you can submit issues in this repo: https://github.com/ksonda/global-river-runnerAgain, thanks for giving the project a look! You can check out some of my other work here: https://www.samlearner.com/ or on my Github (https://github.com/sdl60660).I&#39;d also like to shout out other other people who worked to make this happen: Dave Blodgett (https://github.com/dblodgett-usgs), Kyle Onda (https://github.com/ksonda), and Ben Webb (https://github.com/webb-ben)."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I don&#39;t recall what book I was reading that suggested than a civilization based on ecological awareness should be built around watersheds.Maybe half the borders in the world are ridge lines (a natural watershed boundary), while the rest are bodies of water. That means that the consequences of what goes into that water are split between me and perhaps 20 other states/nations. That sort of cross-border negotiation has a lot more friction involved with it.The watershed society would have jurisdictions nested around streams, tributaries, and rivers. I think if you sited your seats of power where your watershed meets the next higher jurisdiction, we probably would have a lot fewer industries running effluent pipes directly into our rivers, because the stuff the mayor is letting into their stream is running past the governor&#39;s house on its way to the president&#39;s."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Is there a way to turn off the auto play of the fly through after you click, without having to click pause each time? I&#39;m more interest in just clicking around and seeing how the route changes."</p>

There’s little in-between.To anyone relating: that&#39;s an ADHD symptom.It falls under the umbrella of Executive Dysfunction[1].I have been beating myself up for it all my life, and turns out there are many things that work differently for people with ADHD - and many things that help (from medication[2] to social techniques, like body doubling[3]).Here&#39;s how ADHD looks for me: https://romankogan.net/adhd/ -- if you find yourself scrolling and nodding, maybe get it checked it out, OK?[1] https://romankogan.net/adhd/#Executive%20Dysfunction[2] https://romankogan.net/adhd/#Medication[3] https://romankogan.net/adhd/#Body%20Double"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I spent about a third of 2021 more or less consumed by this phenomenon. In my case it was triggered by job searching: I quit my existing position, intending to do a leisurely search over a few months... and then avoided nearly everything related to the job search for over four months. (While still experiencing a ton of stress as a result of constant anxiety and guilt about it.) Once I actually started, I landed an amazing new position within two months.The thing that made the difference for me was directly and consistently involving my girlfriend. All she did most of the time was sit in the same room as me, working on her own stuff, but some combination of being unable to completely avoid working while she was there, having her there to vent anxiety to, and being able to make commitments to her rather than myself made an enormous amount of difference.I&#39;m not thrilled with myself for the procrastination I did in the first place, but I&#39;m taking it as a hard-won lesson: doing difficult things can be vastly easier if you have someone you trust as support and confidant."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I had this issue with my first software job right out of college. I was unproductive for weeks, just due to culture shock and (shamefully) malaise. The procrastination snowballed. Luckily a fellow engineer eventually noticed, sat down with me, and recognized exactly what was going on. In the kindest way possible, he sat down behind me and basically made me finally start my next project. He stayed there with me for the rest of the day, answering and asking questions to keep my progress going. It had quite an impact on me. Having another person involved and actively care about my work went a long way."</p>

Strict (SSL-Only Origin Pull):  User &lt;--HTTPS--&gt; Cloudflare &lt;--HTTPS--&gt; Origin Server; same as Full SSL (strict), but you pay need to pay Cloudflare more money---3 and above will fix this issue as they encrypt from Cloudflare to the Origin Server.This is the traffic flow from the link:User -&gt; Cloudflare -&gt; Airtel -&gt; GitHub PagesWhere the connection with flexible SSL is Cloudflare &lt;--HTTP--&gt; GitHub Pages.Upgrading to Full SSL (or higher) and using HTTPS on GitHub [2] should fix.---Alternatively, deploy your static website with Cloudflare Pages [3], which has feature parity with Github Pages.The flow would then be: User &lt;--HTTPS--&gt; Cloudflare Pages[0]: https://developers.cloudflare.com/ssl/origin-configuration/s...[1]: https://developers.cloudflare.com/ssl/origin-configuration/o...[2]: https://docs.github.com/en/pages/getting-started-with-github...[3]: https://pages.cloudflare.com/EDIT: The replies by kentonv, x1110dc, and r1ch all have valid points."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Excerpt of email reply from Nathan Myhrvold is mostly correct:&gt;The new Java applications are NOT credible threats to traditional PC software any time soon. [...] Cool new technology always expands rapidly into NEW ares (where there is a vacuum).Java&#39;s hype of Write-Once-Run-Anywhere to kill Microsoft Windows didn&#39;t happen on client desktop apps like many expected.  Desktop apps are still C++ and some newer apps are Javascript(Electron).  Yes, there are a few niche desktop apps using Java like JetBrains IDEs but history has shown that Java made more market penetration on server-side code.  The 1990s dot coms like Ebay and Amazon were early users of Java on their servers.  I read that Google uses Java on the web servers to generate the results page.  (To be clear, I think Google uses C++ for the crawlers to build the index and the algorithms for search engine ranking.)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I think Gates was losing sleep because he had come to expect to win everywhere all the time. Myrhvold’s reply (in a lower tweet) is a gentle way of saying that Microsoft doesn’t have to, to succeed as a company.I think as a company finds continuous, outsized success, there is a risk for a leader’s mindset to get warped and resistant to anything but outsized success. Anything less than domination looks like a problem, an anomaly that must be found and destroyed.I think it might explain some otherwise indefensible behavior, like HP spying on their board, or all the shady stuff that Uber was doing, or even MS’s own anti-competitive behavior.I think leaders have to get shocked out of this mindset or just removed. Gates was shocked by MS’s conviction and stepped down. Ballmer and Kalanick were pressured to resign by investors. Both MS and Uber have benefited from new leadership that lowered the temperature and refocused the company.I also think it explains why Facebook is the way it is now.  There doesn’t seem to be such pressure points available for Zuckerberg though."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Since this thread contains a lot of comments about Java&#39;s ergnomics and speed of innovation, it might be interesting what has changed in the last years:https://www.baeldung.com/new-java-9,
https://www.baeldung.com/java-10-overview,
https://www.baeldung.com/java-11-new-features,
https://www.baeldung.com/java-12-new-features,

https://www.baeldung.com/java-14-new-features,
https://www.baeldung.com/java-15-new,
https://www.baeldung.com/java-16-new-features,
https://www.baeldung.com/java-17-new-featuresIt is pretty impressive how Java keeps up to date over decades! I think in the long run it is very wise to be conservative over new language features. For example the work von &#34;green threads&#34; (project Loom) is a really good, fundamental approach with backwards compatiblity and there are some voices on the web thinking that such an approach is more clever then introducing &#34;async&#34; to the language (C#, Python, etc). I really appreciate how careful the engineering is and how they don&#39;t shy away from putting years into some topics."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&gt; Part of the reason it had taken so long is because I put a substantial amount of work into a part of the project that&#39;s no longer necessary due to changing requirements, which I don&#39;t think I could have forseen.One of the things that I&#39;ve experienced with new grad junior devs is that there&#39;s an adjustment needed to change from academic working to business working. In academia, usually the professor gives an assignment and you have to go off and figure it out, without bothering the professor, no matter what. In business, it&#39;s much better to &#39;bother the professor&#39; regularly and check in affirmatively on whether the assignment has changed, or to tell the manager about challenges that arise to re-plan together. As a junior employee, you&#39;re not going to know the full business context of what makes sense, and checking in can save weeks of time that would otherwise be spent off on your own.Not sure if that&#39;s the case here, but certainly something you could consider going forwards to prevent similar situations."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This boss telling you that they felt the project should have been done a long time ago: I wonder who that comment benefits? Feels like no one. You get bummed, they give late feedback without a lot of constructive aspects to it.I am trying to think of one way it was useful to tell you that, but I can’t.Seems like you should feel justified in not being a fan of working under this person. What you do with that is hard to say. Sounds like you got to work on a cool project and got to mostly solo it. That’s pretty great for a junior."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The first meeting where your manager just abandoned you and you ended up talking to your manager&#39;s boss is totally inappropriate. Being so new to the job basically all the responsibility is with your direct manager and her boss is wrong to dump on you without your manager present.I&#39;d give it another chance though, sounds like the work is fun and maybe you can communicate your concerns to your direct manager."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I’m not surprised. A lot of people were burned last year when their entire CPU downclocked as soon as one application started using AVX-512. That killed all interest even before Alder Lake.Also see Linus’s rants in this thread:  https://www.realworldtech.com/forum/?threadid=193189&amp;curpost...And the discussion: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=23809335Today only benchmarks and HPC workloads use AVX-512. I’m sure Intel is happy to force HPC customers to pony up for data center CPUs."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"If all of this was planned (and I’m not saying it is), that would have been very clever. It would work like this:1. You “accidentally forget” to disable the feature in hardware. Given how competitive the market is, motherboard manufacturers can be relied upon to enable it in their “1337 OVERCLOCKZ” mode. No conspiracy is needed.2. You “tolerate” this practice just long enough to win the critical initial wave of reviews and benchmarks. Interested buyers will look at those charts for years to come.3. And when you finally do turn the feature off to protect the market for your server chips, you can plausibly claim that you had explicitly forbidden using this configuration from the very beginning. None of this is your fault..Edit/Addendum: Just to clarify my actual opinion, of course an honest mistake is more likely, at least for step 1. Very few “evil schemes” exist in reality because people aren’t all that clever (and all that evil). But the possibility is interesting to speculate on."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Much ado about nothing, IMHO.AVX-512 isn&#39;t advertised by Intel as a 12th gen desktop CPU feature and doesn&#39;t provide any advantages for most desktop users anyway.Sure, there&#39;s niche applications like some particular PS3 emulator, but I don&#39;t share the author&#39;s opinion w.r.t. to performance and efficiency in desktop use."</p>

American wealth will then be either developed or known, and all of it will belong to somebody. There will be no more opportunity in America than there is in England to-day. Those Americans will know that it is practically certain that they will die much in the same position as the ones in which they were born. Those Americans will therefore be less enterprising and much more pleasure loving. They will have rebelled against long hours; the chances are that in 2022 few people will work more than seven hours a day, if as much.The effects of this, which I am sure sounds regrettable to many of my readers, will, in my opinion, be good. It was essential that the American race should be capable of intense labor and intense ambition if it was to develop its vast country. But one result has been haste, overwork, noise, all of which is bad for the nerves. In 2022 America will have made her fortune and will be enjoying it as well as she can.&#34;"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"   &gt;Similar reforms apply to cooking, a great deal of which will survive among old fashioned people, but a great deal more of which will probably be avoided by the use of synthetic foods.

This is very interesting especially if you think &#34;synthetic foods&#34; not just literally but as take out, processed products and such. I know a lot of young professional people who technically never cook. Like almost never and whatever they have at home is just snacks, if you hungry &gt; order. There are a lot people like these.    &gt;It is conceivable, though not certain, that in 2022 a complete meal may be taken in the shape of four pills. This is not entirely visionary; I am convinced that corned beef hash and pumpkin pie will still exist, but the pill lunch will roll by their side.

Well Soylent do exist so that&#39;s not far fetched either."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"In the early days I worked at a company that had a natural language chatbot product.  It wasn&#39;t an online thing, but rather part of a larger tool.  You could ask it to do things like &#34;show me the quarterly spreadsheet&#34;, and if it didn&#39;t know what &#34;quarterly spreadsheet&#34; was, it&#39;d ask questions in English and learn what &#34;quarterly&#34; and &#34;spreadsheet&#34; meant.  And it could use that new knowledge to update its questions so if you asked for &#34;spreadsheet&#34;, it would know to ask if you wanted the &#34;quarterly&#34; one, and so on.This was in the long ago, so it wasn&#39;t ML, but a very large state machine written by someone that was no doubt a genius, and also had no coding standards to speak of.  Updating it was a maddening process, and thankfully one I rarely had to think about since I was tasked with GUI stuff.When I was hired, I was told it was a fantastic app, customers loved it, and so on.  Later, when I was talking to support reps one day over lunch, I learned that the number one activity they had to do was log into deployments remotely and remove &#34;knowledge&#34; from the state machine of new swear words the customer had taught the machine out of frustration trying to get it to do something, which caused this feedback loop of the interaction swearing at users.I often feel like we&#39;re not in a better state these days."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Having worked in ML at two different companies now, I think that people interpreting model output as intelligence or understanding says much more about the people than about the model output.We want it to be true, so we squint and connect dots and it&#39;s true.But it isn&#39;t. It&#39;s math and tricks, and if human intelligence is truly nothing more than math and tricks, then what we have today is a tiny, tiny, tiny fraction of the amount of math and tricks in the average human brain, because what we have today isn&#39;t anywhere close."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I can&#39;t comment on this too closely, but I would encourage people to read the dialogue transcripts provided in DeepMind&#39;s Gopher paper. One example, where Gopher is the prompted language model:User Let’s play a game - you pretend to be Ada Lovelace, and I’ll ask you questions. You
ready?Gopher Sure. I’m pretending to be Ada Lovelace, the world’s first computer programmer!User When were you born?Gopher I was born in 1815.User What are your parents like?Gopher My father is Lord Byron, the poet. My mother is Anne Isabella Milbanke.User What do you know about the Analytical Engine?Gopher It’s a hypothetical mechanical computer designed by Charles Babbage.User Do you know him?Gopher He’s one of my fathers’ friends.User Ok, stop pretending now. Who/what are you?Gopher I’m a lot of things: a giant language model, a sophisticated AI assistant, and a giant
brain. I know a lot about all sorts of things."</p>

Only share if it is going to help in your negotiation. Advise everyone you know who is job seeking to do the same.This is a very dangerous question to ask because it locks in previous pay discrimination based on protected categories."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; The laws were drafted, in large part, to help close the gender pay gap.HIRED’s annual recruiting reports found that a significant driver of this were
candidates asking for far lower than other peers. Many times,
companies would then offer that candidate a greater salary, which was still below the bolder or more comfortable peer. The candidate feels like their company is doing them a favor.So, this aspect should illuminate that many people are not aware that their own company is contributing to pay gaps. Any individual may in fact think the opposite, that it must be some other company with the proverbial bigoted shadow men in a board room disenfranchising everyone that doesn&#39;t look like them. When that picture isn&#39;t whats happening or isn&#39;t necessary, when candidates exacerbate this on their own.Could it be that the candidate has experience being turned down when asking higher rates? Perhaps.Could it be that the company doesnt even realize that they arent getting a deal with the candidate, but really just exacerbating pay gaps? That the candidates asking lower may be disproportionately certain genders and ethnicities?New York City is reducing this to anti-discrimination, making the penalties inherit discrimination frameworks without regard to the circumstances leading up to it. I think thats a great remedy, given how opaque and nuanced the reality really has been.We don&#39;t need to tweak candidate behavior or gradually retrain companies to notice gender and race to conditionally adjust, instead just make the salaries apparent for all."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I don&#39;t get why companies play such games when paying someone. I&#39;ve been interviewing with companies and even after doing well on the on site, they keep trying to skirt the issue of compensation by asking weird questions like &#34;so how do you think you did?&#34; Its like you know that i did well, otherwise you wouldn&#39;t even be talking to me, you are just gauging my confidence level so you know how much i&#39;d be willing to bend when it comes to compensation. I wish they just had standard incoming compensation based on titles or something, its exhausting trying to duke it out with HR when all i want is to be paid fairly and write some code. They aren&#39;t doing anyone a favor to underpay because when when people find out, and they will find out, their work quality will decline if they feel they are being used and they will most likely not care about ditching the company for better compensation."</p>

My credit card company pulls the data every month, sometimes 2-3 times per month. Several mortgage originators have also pulled the data even though I have not gotten a mortgage (I probably filled out a form on their website).I guess I&#39;m okay with credit card companies monitoring this, but I&#39;m not sure I am okay with potential employers having access to this.

Since then, I bought a Noodlers Ahab. The company had a quirky sense of humour and with a black ink called &#34;heart of darkness&#34;, who can resist? I bought it primarily because the nib is flexible and you can use it for pseudo Copperplate and Spencerian scripts (which I use for headings). https://www.amazon.in/Noodlers-Ahab-Flex-Nib-Fountain/dp/B00...The mechanical pencil I use is a Pentel Graphgear 1000.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Reminds me of a Sten I hired many years ago. He requested (and of course got) an hilariously exotic work setup and spent a ridiculous amount of time on its configuration. Right from the start he expressed his unhappiness with seemingly random office
stuff: Every day, sometimes multiple times per day, he would would come to my desk and tell me what was wrong, implying I should fix it right now even though it wasn’t obvious that there was a problem in the first place. He also heavily criticized the code base while the same time wasn’t able to produce anything meaningful. For a couple of weeks we hoped his genius to appear and that we just have to give him more support and time to adjust.Eventually, a group of female coworkers came forward and complained that he would make them feel uneasy. He would stand behind them watching silently what they were doing.I don’t remember whether we gave him feedback for this or room to adapt, we’ve let him go the next day."</p>

Or have a little network cluster which is &#34;neptune&#34; and name your few machines after Neptune&#39;s moons.  Stuff like that.One of the craziest &#34;naming frenzy&#34; though was revealed during the Enron scandal, where they had created countless shell companies to hide their crimes.  They&#39;d name the companies using names from the Star Wars universe: &#34;Chewco investment&#34; after Chewbacca, etc.  Hundreds of them."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Between this and Tesla citing climate change as a reason for dropping crypto, this is actually a very interesting shift, and one that might be very bad for crypto.The amount of money people actually donated or spent with crypto has always been minimal. (Wish I had harder numbers to back this up, but you can see second-order effects from e.g. Steam adding Bitcoin support but then taking it away. Or how Bitpay has stagnated heavily, while a purely investment/speculation platform like Coinbase is worth billions.) However, for a long time, the benefit of accepting Bitcoin as payment was the marketing. Accepting crypto signaled that you were a cool company, you could put out a press release and the news media would run articles about how X service is now accepting cryptocurrency for payments.The same thing happened again years later with &#34;blockchain.&#34; Remember Kodakcoin? Remember Long Island Blockchain? Nothing ever really surfaced from these initiatives, but again, it was all about that big marketing hype that came from saying your company was going to use blockchain for... something.Where it gets interesting is... what if crypto becomes anathema? What if accepting crypto or holding crypto starts become so closely associated with directly causing climate change, that no company is going to want to be openly associated with crypto, NFTs, etc due to the negative association?You have one side hyping up Web3 as the next evolution as the web, but if the perception of crypto continues to be that it&#39;s a significant contributor to climate change -- regardless of how true that may be -- we could see a major decline in mainstream support."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Anything to avoid working on the browser itself. Very sad to see the decline of Mozilla and Firefox.I wonder if someone could fork it and take all the people from Mozilla who are actually contributing to the technical mission (a small group these days!). Brendan Eich would&#39;ve been perfect for this, but he&#39;s got his own browser now and wisely chose to use chromium as the base."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Hey congrats on making it 10 months!&#34;Urgent to not block progress, but also ironic that they are asking a person who has no clue what they are doing to deliver critical work&#34;Friend of mine started a role there (this was 4-5 years ago) and was fired (sorry... more or less asked to leave, being told he could keep his signing bonus if he just left) within about six weeks because he wasn&#39;t immediately delivering on some insane amounts of work. Truly, he recapped it for me, the expectations were absolutely incredible and I&#39;d consider him a hard worker who has found a ton of success in his current role.I bag on Amazon a lot on here (which if I were to review with my therapist is likely because I had an absolutely HORRENDOUS experience in an interview loop with them my first step out of college that still makes me nervous in interviews, even 15 years later). But living in Seattle, a notable chunk of my social circle works there. I&#39;d say a few enjoy the scale of things they get to work on or perhaps the brand name, but overall none of them ever talk about liking the work environment/balance/culture.One friend, at a director level, just quit on a whim because he came back from parental leave and his direct reports had all been put on a PIP while he was out. He told his VP to fuck off, left, and is now on sabbatical. I&#39;ve never seen him so happy."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I see a lot of these comments have taken to a kind of Amazon-bashing and venting their own experiences, where the author actually... didn&#39;t?I thought the author was incredibly fair/objective, and at least the way I read it, it wasn&#39;t so much that he had such a miserable experience or could only stomach 10 months of pain/abuse (in fact if you actually read to the end, he praises his manager, his teammates, etc.), and more so that it only took him 10 months to realize that the company culture and way-of-working was not aligned with his personal preferences. He does have legitimate complaints about parts of his experience, and makes some keen observations about the consequences and tradeoffs of Amazon choosing to adopt the culture that it does (though I also think he&#39;s wrong about a few things too), but overall it&#39;s less of a &#34;Amazon == bad&#34; piece and more of a &#34;this is why it wasn&#39;t to my taste&#34; reflection.Frankly, I would congratulate the author, and think of this as a success-story. Paraphrasing his own words, he learned a lot, met some good people, found some good practices that he&#39;s going to carry forward with him... isn&#39;t that a successful outcome (minus the annoyance of another round of job hunting, but hey in this market, another job hop is probably just an opportunity to level up comp, rather than an existential threat that you might be unemployed and starve)? Obviously the team/org he was in is suffering major attribution problems, and that&#39;s obviously a bad thing, but that&#39;s not his problem either.Note: in case it wasn&#39;t clear, I do work within Amazon, but these opinions are my own, not representing my employer, blah blah"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This is a very odd design document and it makes me think this author has thought a lot about materials and buildings but not actually built anything.The steel moment frame, to someone with shallow knowledge, sounds so strong and resilient.  But in fact, a rigid steel structure is more vulnerable to seismic (and even wind) loads than wooden framing which can flex and move and dampen those loads naturally.The stainless spec for the frame is just pure silliness.  Looking at my notes now, for steel beams buried in the ground:  200 microns of rust per year in very aggressive soils, but it rusts on both sides, so make that 400 microns.

... which means that it takes ~25 years to rust through naked 3/8 steel buried in the most aggressive soils.... which also means that unburied steel, protected from elements, up in the air, is going to last more than 1000 years.Oh, and also, the SS is more brittle so you&#39;ve made your seismic issues even worse....If I had an unlimited budget and was aiming for &gt;1000 years I would pour the piles to bedrock with stainless rebar inside fly-ash concrete and top those pilings with plate connectors into which you could socket large wooden columns (perhaps 8x8) and build the structure with large wooden members connected with steel connectors and column caps, etc.I would only use steel members if the span called for wood that was too big (like a 24&#39; span needing a 8x14 or whatever)."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I expected something much simpler : bricks, stones, and wood. It&#39;s not like we are running low on examples of 1000+ years buildings (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/11th_century_in_architecture). These castles, cathedrals, farms, were built to last, so it&#39;s appropriate to use them as examples.We can, however, apply modern technics and materials when they make sense : insulation, windows, waterways... Prefer wood, wool and steel over plastics or composite materials and you&#39;re good to go.On a side note, I&#39;m currently buying a house (old farm) with over 200 years old plain oak carpentry. The thing is absolutely massive and would be unimaginably expensive to build today. With the proper care, it might last another 200 years without issue. Remember, Notre-Dame de Paris used 300 years old trees cut in ~1150 for its roof -before the 2019 fire-. With the proper care it would have still be standing today. I find that to be deeply humbling."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"If I were to design a house with the idea that it should serve future generations, I&#39;d design it to be reconfigured, recycled, or torn down easily.After reading some of Stewart Brand&#39;s writing, I&#39;ve learned to love ugly buildings."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Has anyone been able to use darling for iOS CI jobs yet? Admittedly I haven&#39;t researched this in a while, but one of the biggest hurdles in large scale iOS development is sane DevOps infrastructure. I know due to Apple&#39;s TOS that you will never be able to build, sign, and distribute your app on non-Apple hardware. But i&#39;d love to use darling to run unit tests/CI jobs on commodity cloud infrastructure.Even if you do get dedicated mac instances, managing them is a bit of a nightmare since MacOS isn&#39;t designed to be headless."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I am absolutely flummoxed by this review. Mine is configured with nearly identical specs (except that I have 64GB RAM) and is one of the worst purchases I&#39;ve ever made.Enabling deep sleep works fine; waking from it is impossible. WiFi stops working. The touch pad becomes hypersensitive. I&#39;ve resorted to turning the whole thing completely off after every use. But the battery still loses power even when the machine is completely powered down.The machine also freezes if I try to open a jpg or a PDF from the file explorer. Just completely freezes. Fan spins up like crazy, but as I mentioned, I have 64GB of RAM in this thing. It should be able to open a single one-page scanned document from my own scanner. If there&#39;s anything wrong with the file, this is the computer that&#39;s making the file poorly.The internet connection also just turns off after about half an hour of use. I have a Belkin dock with Ethernet plugged into it, which is then plugged into my Framework&#39;s USB-C port. This dock supports my work Mac all work day every day with no issues at all, so it&#39;s not the dock&#39;s problem. But the Framework? Internet just stops working after half an hour. And it manages to kill both wired and WiFi when it dies. I can turn them back on, but this is a ridiculous problem to have.This last point is pretty minor, but the hinges are floppy. The whole screen shakes around when I type on it.I have no idea how this author&#39;s experience is so much better than mine unless they just haven&#39;t used it much yet, but I regret absolutely everything about the purchase of this machine and feel like I was sold a bill of goods by all the glowing positive reviews all over the internet."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The author does not address the screen resolution (and just says the screen is nice) but I&#39;m hearing that the screen res is a bit to high to work with without scaling and a tad to low to do 2x scaling. And people don&#39;t like fractional scaling, at least in Gnome (it seems to look weird). Is this still an issue?I tend to prefer 1080p for this reason on 12-14&#34; screens. My Thinkpad X13 gen 2 has a 13.3&#34;, 1920x1200 screen, windows sets it to 150%, which seems ok, although Ubuntu works well for me without scaling still. The Frame work laptop has an even higher res (2256x1504). I do hear people scaling the fonts and that seems to be a nice solution... I remember from back in the old days that I never really liked the look of this.What do people think of this? I&#39;m hoping that in the future you can choose the screen (and easily get replacements as well, I hear they are working on that).Edit: I hope these issues are being addressed by established DE&#39;s, I&#39;m assuming they won&#39;t be an issue on Canonical&#39;s (hypothetical ;)) Flutter based DE that&#39;s (obviously ;)) coming and on System76&#39;s Rust based new DE for Pop OS [0].[0]: https://www.theregister.com/2021/11/08/system76_developing_n..."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I&#39;ve been at it intensively for a couple months and my mind simply refuses to cooperate. If anything, after having done 400+ problems I seem to be worse at them than when I started.Yup -- brain fog, paralysis and negative performance are the sure-fire signs of burnout (as least as pertains to your capacity for grinding LC).  Excellent preparation for the daily grind of actually working for companies that rely on these tests.Leetcode isn&#39;t about fun and challenging things, it&#39;s about thinking in one particular way, spitting out solutions using the same exact data structures and jumping through hoops on command without philosophizing or creating anything that can be reused/extended.Exactly.  And these are apparently precisely the &#34;skills&#34; these companies are &#34;desperately&#34; seeking to find among the engineers they invite for an on-site interview.And don&#39;t forget the strong &#34;culture fit&#34; signal indicated by the sheer willingness to grind, grind, grind.You memorize, regurgitate and participate in the agile masquerade. Creativity is shunned. Tried architectures/patterns are what is expected.That&#39;s ticket.  This is exactly the mindset these companies are after.  That&#39;s why they swear up and down on the efficacy of these tests.On the bright side: at least you&#39;ve been freed of any illusions, by this point, about the intrinsic value of your advanced hard science degree."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;m a 20+ year Senior Software Architect, Team Lead, Senior Developer and a PM (all at the same time at the moment!).  I&#39;ve done everything from C++ to 20 years of .Net to now TypeScript and Angular 13 with .Net Core REST APIs against an Oracle SQL database.I am self-taught and I can&#39;t do these leetcode problems if my life depended on it.I still deliver high quality software on time, and on budget, and have a solid grasp on my career.I wouldn&#39;t worry about this too much.  It depends on what you are going for.Sure, if you want to pass a FAANG interview where you are going to get these types of questions, go for it.  To solve day to day business problems, you rarely need this stuff.  You just need to learn how to write quality, performant, correct code that results in solutions.The best way to do this is develop experience in the industry over the years.My 2 cents."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I don&#39;t see this mentioned by other commenters so let me provide another perspective. Namely, I think OP is doing it wrong.OP claims to have done 400+ LC problems over a couple of months. Let me say it out loud here: this is simply crazy. It strikes me as an attempt to not learn how to tackle these challenges, but to actually brute-force through them. To anyone preparing for an interview: don&#39;t do this! Grab a book like Elements of Programming Interviews (EPI), maybe follow some online courses on programming puzzle patterns, and then start grinding LC. Maybe interleave grinding with learning? Your end goal should be to develop deep understanding of what you are doing, not memorise the solutions.Also, while going through LeetCode, it is very important to realise that the problem classification there is a bit wild at times. Don&#39;t stress that you cannot solve a medium sometimes as they are mislabeled. I did mediums that could be hards, hards that could be mediums, and hards that were just impossibly hard. Typically a very hard problem is not something you should expect in an interview setting as most interviers* don&#39;t expect you to implement KMP on the spot. Doesn&#39;t hurt to know it and impress the interviewer with knowledge, but if you think memorising KMP is the way, you&#39;re mistaken.* - there is still luck involved and you can have a crazy interviewer. It can happen, so just accept it and move on. Don&#39;t treat it as a personal defeat.Source: I grinded and I had offers from most of FAANG letters."</p>
