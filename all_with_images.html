								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"A modern circuit simulator, that has a fully featured programable API, that can be run from a real modern programming language, would be a dream.
Every simulator i have used has been pretty limited in that way, or at least those features were not well advertized.
Even the insanely expensive ones.
I mean the most expensive ones (like $100K liscense type deals, like Cadence) are if anything even less modern from a user interaction perspective.My first academic paper 
(https://www.oxinabox.net/publications/White2015PsoTransistor...) was based on doing a search over parameters for the transistors being used in a circuit.
The way that whole thing work was by string mangling the netlist file to update the parameters.
Triggering the simulator on the commandline.
Getting it to output a CSV of the signals.
Parsing that CSV, and detecting edges and then measuring timing that way.
Then throwing it at a particle swarm optimizer to fine a new one.
That sucks from a user experience.
It&#39;s a super cool way to  solve problems though.
that would be so easy with a real API.Further, with julia being a differnetiable programming language, rather than having to use a particular swarm optimizer to search, I could have been differentiating it, and using some sophisticated gradient descent like LBGFS etc.I hope that some of the general tools like this will be an outcome of this project."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Call me skeptical but to claim 1000x improvement for circuit simulation is at least hyperbole or outright lying. I will love to be proven wrong though. This by the fact that Julia is still depending on third party numerical libraries, e.g. OpenBLAS that depends on faster numerical languages like Fortran.If you want to see next generation circuit simulation and automation that already working check out JITX. The simulator is using their advanced LB Stanza language which similar if not better than Julia[1]. This is the same team from Berkeley that proposed CHISEL and FIRRTL.Other promising efforts on next generation digital and analog circuit design are from MLIR by LLVM team and LLHD from ETH Zurich [2][3].[1]http://lbstanza.org/

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I have opinions about writing. So does Mr. Graham.What our opinions have in common is that they are not falsifiable. Unless we validate our conjectures with empirical evidence, we&#39;re really just sharing our taste.&#34;Oh no,&#34; you may say, &#34;I have tested it, and when I write a longer essay, my retweets and upvotes decline.&#34; Very well, but the plural of anecdote is not &#39;data.&#39;Somewhere else on the Internet, there is someone with poetic, dense writing. When they simplify it, their audience dries up.Writers and audiences find each other. If you try to measure the effect of your writing using only an audience that has selected your writing voluntarily, you are not measuring your effectiveness, you are measuring the degree to which your writing pleases people who already like your writing.Absent a properly constructed empirical approach, we might as well be discussing hemlines and necktie widths."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"For grins I pasted PG&#39;s text into the demo readability tool at &lt;https://app.readable.com/text/?demo&gt;.&#39;Write Simply&#39; received an overall grade of &#39;A&#39;, and a very-approachable Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level of 5.9. It&#39;s said to be readable by 100% of the literate general public, which is only 85% of the full general public.But, out of the 507 words and 38 sentences, 4 sentences were flagged as &#34;very long&#34; (over 30 syllables) and 15 as &#34;long&#34; (over 20 syllables).Two &#39;hard words&#39; – over 12 letters or over 4 syllables – were flagged, somewhat ironically: &#34;unnecessarily intellectual&#34;."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Am I the only one not very fond of this style of writing? It&#39;s the constant pauses and hiccups that I&#39;m reading. Four paragraphs into it, and I still don&#39;t get a lot of information about what the author is trying to convey.In good essays, the first and last sentence in a paragraph are often enough to summarize the points. It helps set the context, and makes it much easier for the reader to make a mental map of the overall idea. In this article, its &#34;hiccup&#34; style of writing makes it much harder to build a mental map. You can&#39;t predict where it will go until you fully read the sentence.I usually enjoy reading most of PG essays. For this one, I don&#39;t enjoy reading it, and I stopped reading after paragraph 4."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Some of these recipes seem decent if you&#39;re already somewhat experienced and have developed cook&#39;s intuition. Otherwise they&#39;re way too vague. For instance, the chicken parm recipe:- There should be a photo of how to slice the chicken breast. Saying &#34;through their width&#34; isn&#39;t good enough. I had to explain what &#34;lengthwise&#34; was once because my friend cut all the vegetables the exact opposite of it.- Pound with what? A lot of people will come up with very bad answers to this question.- How much flour? How much egg? I&#39;ll bet that plenty of beginners will use a tablespoon of flour or a singular egg- Ditto with oil. Beginners do not know how much oil is necessary to fry stuff- How high heat? You probably want to turn down the heat after the oil starts smoking.- Is there a single mention of adding salt? Sounds like a pretty bland recipeI don&#39;t mean to be too harsh but recipes are hard. There&#39;s a reason why professional recipe developers have developed certain standards like measurements, terms (folding batter, shimmering oil, etc.), and development procedures (cross testing)."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Am I the only one who thinks that this concept is perfectly good, and all the things the site doesn&#39;t have are just great further development of the idea?What&#39;s wrong with a &#34;wikipedia for recipes&#34;? I would LOVE that.All the complaints about the quality of the recipes or the lack of more in-depth explaination of each one, some kind of  voting/reputation system for the recipes and for the submitters and the voters, Yes those are all good ideas to make the db more useful than just a db.But you have to start somewhere. How is the core idea here of a public cookbook not fundamentally awesome? I mean hello... GIT. Recipes that are living documents that can be honed over time, complete with viewable history of what changes have been made so you can decide if you agree with them. Branches and forks for all the hundred variations on any given thing. Revisions by better experts than the original submitter of some recipe.So, today on day one it doesn&#39;t already have the benefit of years of contributions and incremental improvements and revisions, Quelle Suprise!"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The info about salt is plain wrong. Kosher salt is used for curing meat and as a mainly decorative addition to baking, you don&#39;t need to use it for cooking, it doesn&#39;t dissolve noticably slower in liquids. In fact when most recipes specify a volumetric measurement of salt they mean table salt and if you were to use kosher or sea salt you would be under seasoning due the reduced volume, nothing to do with how quickly it dissolves.You should definitely not be using large grain salt in baking for this reason, unless it is to decorate a finished product.Iodine deficiencies were and are very, very real. They&#39;re also on the rise due to food deserts and rising poverty. Iodised salt largely eliminated iodine deficiencies so people with poor knowledge of the history think they just went away. Most processed food does not contained iodised salt, so table salt is an essential source or iodine for a great many people around the world.Idosing salt was and is one of the greatest public health success stories of the 20th century, do not talk about it like some conspiracy by government."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Brings back some memories because this was the first &#34;large&#34; program available to me for study when I was first learning to program, around 1978.Having talked my way into using the local university EE dept&#39;s 11/45, I found the source tree was mounted (they had a 90MB CDC &#34;washing machine&#34; drive) and decided to print it out on the 132-col Tally dot-matrix printer.Some minutes into this, the sysadmin bursts into the terminal room, angrily asking &#34;who&#39;s running this big print job&#34;.I timidly raise my hand. He asks what I&#39;m printing. I tell him the C compiler source code because I want to figure out how it works.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Plastic card distribution can be extremely frustrating, because the only time you need it to happen is when you don&#39;t actually want it to be needed (fruad, loss, damage, new account, whatever). You just want to fucking buy things, not deal with shipping incompetence, you know?This reminds me of a time I was traveling and had to cancel a lost credit card. I told the card company that I was not at home,was definitely outside of the country, not going to be home, definitely staying at an address that was not the home address listed on the account, wanted the card to be sent to _me_ and not my _home_, gave them my foreign delivery address 5 times over as many weeks, got 5 separate promises that the card was definitely going to reach me at my outside-of-the-country-and-not-at-home location in just a few business days, and the card never showed up. So I just gave up. And then, when I finally went home there were 5 goddamn cards in my mail slot.Honestly this reason alone makes Apple&#39;s purely digital credit card my favorite. Need a new card number? Just push a button. No incompetent shipping divisions with 5 hops and as many business days between you and your ability to buy things when your card number is breached."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I live in the Netherlands, a country that primarily uses debit cards. I do have a credit card that I rarely use. Only when I buy something in the USA for example.Some years back I moved to a different city. About a year later I wanted to make a purchase with my credit card. I found out it had expired. I rang the bank and asked for a new one. They promised to send it to me. It never arrived. Rang again, got the same promise, and still no card. When I called them the third time, the employee found out my old address was still in their database. Turns out the credit card department had a different client database then the debit card department (who had my new address).To change my address, I had to log in to their site. They weren&#39;t allowed to change it on the phone. As soon I tried to log in, I noticed I forgot my password. When I clicked &#39;reset password&#39;, there was a new surprise: they send the new password by snail mail.... to the old address of course!So I had to go in person to the house I used to live in and explain the situation. I asked them to ring me when the letter with my name on it arrived on their doorstep. Luckily the people who now live in my old house were very nice and gave me the letter!"</p>

        z    string
    }

with sentinel strings like &#34;\04&#34; and &#34;\0\06&#34; for IPv4 and IPv6-no-zone was rejected.  Sure, this 8 bytes larger for the implicit string length, but its still not terribly large, and the string comparisons in the normal IPv4 / IPv6 case are very cheap (just length and pointer equality checks).  And it doesn&#39;t require opening the unsafe jar.  Was the extra 8 bytes enough to disqualify it?  Or are the authors worried about the fact that this may allocate on each parse of an IPv6-with-zone?"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This is why I still use a 720p LCD TV from the early 2000s.Am I ever tempted to get a bigger, higher-def, TV? Sure, but then I remember that they&#39;re all &#34;smart&#34; and realize I don&#39;t actually have a problem with how I&#39;m watching TV now.I don&#39;t want smart anything in my house. My lights are hardwired to a switch on the wall. My washer and drier need me to turn dials and push buttons and go ding when they&#39;re done. My fridge has no microprocessor in it.I honestly don&#39;t understand people who want all this internet connected garbage. These things weren&#39;t broke, they don&#39;t need fixing!"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"It&#39;s been said many times here over the past few years, and it&#39;ll get said a lot right here today, but rule of thumb: never  enable WiFi on a TV except maybe temporarily to do an update or something. And even then only if it&#39;s absolutely necessary. Get a Roku or an Apple TV or a game console or whatever you want for watching streaming services. Never use what&#39;s built in to the TV, not just for privacy reasons but because it always seems to be a terrible experience compared to running Hulu, Netflix, etc. on anything else. But for privacy too- the TV companies were incredibly egregious about privacy years ago and AFAICT it&#39;s only gotten worse since then."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"At this stage, these threads are getting kind of boring, it&#39;s clear that almost all manufacturers are in a race to the bottom in terms of cost - and now the only way that they can compete on price is by bundling adverts into your internet connected set.All talk of &#34;voting with your wallet&#34; doesn&#39;t work when there are literally no &#34;smart&#34; consumer sets that can compete on features and are without adverts.If you really wish to have your smart TV connected to the internet - I&#39;ve listed some of the adservers that you can block at : https://factory-reset.com/wiki/Smart_TV_Adverts - however this is also going to be a tiresome game, as manufacturers will just seek to find more creative ways to serve adverts.The reality is though, if you want to avoid this behaviour - buy the set that has the screen that you want and only connect it to the internet if you wish to do a software update. Only software update if your set has a bug that the advertised firmware actually fixes, as newer updates tend to add more &#34;features&#34; - adverts, slower apps etc etc. Use something like and AppleTV or a Roku device connected via HDMI if you really need smart features - but be aware even the likes of Roku / Nvidia Shield / FireTV will at some point in the future also be serving you adverts.I&#39;ve also heard that some sets are trying to find open wifi networks - if you are really that worried, cut the traces on the wifi card inside the set and hope that manufacturers don&#39;t start to use ethernet over HDMI."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Back in the late 90s, I implemented the first systematic monitoring of WalMart Store&#39;s global network, including all of the store routers, hubs (not switches yet!) and 900mhz access points.
Did you know that WalMart had some stores in Indonesia? They did until 1998.So when https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/May_1998_riots_of_Indonesia started happening, we heard some harrowing stories of US employees being abducted, among other things.Around that same time, the equipment in the Jakarta store started sending high temperature alerts prior to going offline. Our NOC wasn&#39;t able to reach anyone in the store.The alerts were quite accurate: that was one of the many buildings that had been burned down in the riots. I guess it&#39;s slightly surprising that electrical power to the equipment in question lasted long enough to allow temperature alerting. Most of our stores back then used satellite for their permanent network connection, so it&#39;s possible telcom died prior to the fire reaching the UPC office.In a couple of prominent places in the home office, there were large cutouts of all of the countries WalMart was in at the time up on the walls. A couple of weeks after this event, the Indonesia one was taken down over the weekend and the others re-arranged."</p>

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lp0_on_fireReally though, I feel truly awful for anyone affected by this. The post recommends implementing a disaster recovery plan. The truth is that most people don&#39;t have one. So, let&#39;s use this post to talk about Disaster Recovery Plans!Mine: I have 5 servers at OVH (not at SBG) and they all back up to Amazon S3 or Backblaze B2, and I also have a dedicated server (also OVH/Kimsufi) that gets the backups. I can redeploy in less than a day on fresh hardware, and that&#39;s good enough for my purposes. What&#39;s YOUR Disaster Recovery Plan?"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"A bigger problem in my opinion is that Rust has chosen to follow the poll-based model (you can say that it was effectively designed around epoll), while the completion-based one (e.g. io-uring and IOCP) with high probability will be the way of doing async in future (especially in the light of Spectre and Meltdown).Instead of carefully weighing advantages and disadvantages of both models, the decision was effectively made on the ground of &#34;we want to ship async support as soon as possible&#34; [1]. Unfortunately, because of this rush, Rust got stuck with a poll-based model with a whole bunch of problems without a clear solution in sight (async drop anyone?). And instead of a proper solution for self-referencing structs (yes, a really hard problem), we did end up with the hack-ish Pin solution, which has already caused a number of problems since stabilization and now may block enabling of noalias by default [2].Many believe that Rust async story was unnecessarily rushed. While it may have helped to increase Rust adoption in the mid term, I believe it will cause serious issues in the longer term.[1]: https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/62149#issuecomment-...
[2]: https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/63818"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;m not totally sure what the author is asking for, apart from refcounting and heap allocations that happen behind your back. In my experience async Rust is heavily characterised by tasks (Futures) which own their data. They have to - when you spawn it, you&#39;re offloading ownership of its state to an executor that will keep it alive for some period of time that is out of the spawning code&#39;s control. That means all data/state brought in at spawn time must be enclosed by move closures and/or shared references backed by an owned type (Arc) rather than &amp; or &amp;mut.If you want to, nothing is stopping you emulating a higher-level language - wrap all your data in Arc&lt;_&gt; or Arc&lt;Mutex&lt;_&gt;&gt; and store all your functions as trait objects like Box&lt;dyn Fn(...)&gt;. You pay for extra heap allocations and indirection, but avoid specifying generics that spread up your type hierarchy, and no longer need to play by the borrow checker&#39;s rules.What Rust gives us is the option to _not_ pay all the costs I mentioned in the last paragraph, which is pretty cool if you&#39;re prepared to code for it."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I like to joke that the best way to encounter the ugliest parts of Rust is to implement an HTTP router. Hours and days of boxing and pinning, Futures transformations, no async fn in traits, closures not being real first class citizens, T: Send + Sync + &#39;static, etc.I call this The Dispatch Tax. Because any time you want more flexibility than the preferred static dispatch via generics can give you - oh, so you just want to store all these async fn(HttpRequest) -&gt; Result&lt;HttpResponse&gt;, right? - you immediately start feeling the inconvenience and bulkiness of dynamic dispatch. It&#39;s like Rust is punishing you for using it. And with async/await taking this to a new level altogether, because you are immediately forced to understand how async funcs are transformed into ones that return Futures, how Futures are transformed into anon state machine structs; how closures are also transformed to anon structs. It&#39;s like there&#39;s no type system anymore, only structs.That&#39;s one of the reasons, I think, why Go has won the Control Plane. Sure, projects like K8s, Docker, the whole HashiCorp suite are old news. But it&#39;s interesting and telling that even solid Rust shops like PingCAP are using Go for their control plane. It seems to me that there&#39;s some fundamental connection between flexibility of convenient dynamic dispatch and control plane tasks. And of course having the default runtime and building blocks like net and http in the standard library is a huge win.That said, after almost three months of daily Rust it does get better. To the point when you can actually feel that some intuition and genuine understanding is there, and you can finally work on your problems instead of fighting with the language. I just wish that the initial learning curve wasn&#39;t so high."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I really think that Windows 2000-era Windows Forms had the user experience nailed perfectly.  It wasn&#39;t the prettiest UI paradigm ever, but it was the most functional and easiest to teach.  Nothing was omitted, and the user was shown everything they needed to see in order to get a complete idea of the state of the application.I don&#39;t think that efforts to hide UI elements that aren&#39;t in use is going to prove to be a good idea when we look back at today from the future.Here&#39;s a good rule, in my mind: Don&#39;t hide UI elements from the user.  End of rule.  I do not care if it looks better without whatever UI element.  The toolbox in my garage would look better if I could only see the tools I needed at the time I need them, and I would return that toolbox (or never buy it in the first place) because it is constantly lying to me about the state of the toolbox, which is absolutely insulting position for a toolbox designer to adopt."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; I have a really hard time believing anyone would chose this as opposed to some design lead at Apple pushing a weird personal preference for tidyness on their entire user baseMaybe I don&#39;t understand completely what he is referring to, but on mobile I certainly prefer having a bit more space than a always visible scrollbar. It is usually clear enough that there is more to see below the fold.Scrollbars used to be sometimes useful to get a sense of how much content there is. But everyone using infinite scroll broke that, not apple."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"An interesting output of this is, if you keep scrollbars visible, you&#39;ll find that a lot of websites end up with weird extra scrollbars on random elements.What often causes this is some HTML element overflowing by one pixel, but no one saw it during the QA process because all the webdevs were using Macs, which have invisible scrollbars by default. I always enable visible scrollbars on my dev computers specifically so I can catch problems like this."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&gt;  That way, when candidates were pitched to us with &#34;X years of MOVA experience&#34;, we knew that somebody was full of it.I&#39;d put my money on the recruiter. I once had an excruciatingly awkward interview at a company on an industrial estate in the middle of nowhereland with no train station nearby that took me bloody ages to get to… which was actually going well until they asked me about my long experience with Exchange 2000. I had no experience with Exchange 2000, so I told them, and watched their faces drop.That was specifically why they wanted to speak to me. The recruiter had inserted it onto the copy of the CV he sent to them. I&#39;m surprised I&#39;m not still doing time for murder.What I&#39;m not surprised about though is why they do it. I&#39;ve been to plenty of interviews where my CV hasn&#39;t been given more than a glance. At moments like those I feel a deep sense of pessimism. The whole recruitment process seems broken from end to end and has been for a while."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This reminds me of an anecdote I read once, maybe in Liars Poker, about how lots of people applying to this hedge fund put &#34;Chess&#34; on their resume somewhere thinking it made them seem like a deep or strategic thinker. As it happened, at this hedge fund there worked a former Soviet master or grandmaster ranked player. And so, whenever interviewing any candidate who claimed great proficiency with chess on their resume, at the end of the interview they&#39;d take the candidate to go play the master."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This would benefit the Northeast quite a lot.Assume that your average adult works 9-5, and your average school child is in school 8-3. Broad strokes, these are the two groups to focus on. I know most adults commute earlier than 9, and most students are up earlier than 8, but it&#39;s safe to say that most Americans are up-and-at-&#39;em from 8-5.On the shortest day of the year in Boston, sunrise is at 7:10am and sunset is at 4:14PM. Including civil twilight (&#34;it&#39;s still kind of daytime&#34;) extends it to 6:38am to 4:46PM.Even on the shortest day of the year, if you wake up even before 7 you&#39;re waking up in daylight. But, sunset is super early. Every working adult is commuting home in actual nighttime.Shift that forward 1 hour, and it gets light at 7:30AM and gets dark at 5:45PM. While slightly darker for students in the morning, it&#39;s immensely better for working adults, who at least get some daylight in the evenings, and not actual nighttime before 5PM."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The first few articles I could find on this topic neglected to identify the senators co-sponsoring the bill.  Here&#39;s a list from boston.cbslocal.com:* Roy Blunt (R-MO)* Cindy Hyde-Smith (R-MS)* James Lankford (R-OK)* Ed Markey (D-MA)* Marco Rubio (R-FL)* Rick Scott (R-FL)* Sheldon Whitehouse (D-RI)* Ron Wyden (D-OR)Wikipedia has some history on similar, short-lived efforts in the past:&gt; Seasonal observation of DST was first enacted in the US during World Wars I and II, as an attempt conserve fuel. The practice was unpopular and promptly repealed after each war; however, lobbyists from the petroleum industry lobbied to restore DST, as they had noticed it actually increased fuel consumption.&gt; Permanent DST in the US was briefly enacted by President Nixon in 1974, in response to the 1973 oil crisis. The proposal was initially supported by an estimated 79% of the public; that support dropped to 42% after its first winter, owing to the harshness of dark winter mornings that permanent DST creates. An estimated six school children were also killed by motorists due to the new law.https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Permanent_time_observation_in_...On the eastern edge of the enormous Eastern time zone, I&#39;m sympathetic to permanent DST, but I&#39;m not sure it&#39;s a good idea nationwide.  I would probably be in favor of the proposed Atlantic time zone, though."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"DST has become my favorite &#34;holiday&#34; as an adult. Seasonal depression evaporates when I can see the sun after I finish working for the day. I can go work in my yard, or wash my car after work instead of having to cram it in the middle of the day. I feel more motivated to go do other things in the evening instead of feeling like its time for bed at 5pm."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Fun stuff I read since his passing yesterday in the Dutch newspapers.Although he had indeed humility about his contribution to the cassette tape and the CD, he also was frustrated what Sony did in this department. He wanted the CD to be 11,5 cm instead of 12 cm and was disappointed Sony sold the first CD and invented the concept of a walkman instead of Philips.His opinion about cassette tapes and vinyl having a revival because of the analog experience?&#34;I am not a psychologist, but that music experience is of course all nonsense. Nothing can match the sound of the CD. It is absolutely noise and rumble free. That never worked with tape. But who am I to say what&#39;s better, I&#39;m over ninety and have old ears. I have made a lot of record players and I know that the distortion with vinyl is much higher. But some people call it &#34;warm audio.&#34; I think people mostly hear what they want to hear. But there are always madmen who want to look back to the past. There is always a market for that.”"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I love the humility.I grew up in the era of cassettes.   I’d tape songs of the radio as a kid.  In high school and college I would tape my records and the new “cds” so my music would be portable (Walkman and parents car).My brothers and I bought a really good Yamaha three head cassette player.  We did some a/b testing with cds and with Dolby c it was really hard to tell the difference.Though with Walkman you’d have to clean the rubber rollers when they got a little gummed up and there was always the danger of the tape failing and getting pulled out."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Absolutely worth it, however I&#39;d offer a few short tips:1. Try to stay in one place for a few months, minimum. If you can stay a year or two, do that. Jumping from city to city every week seems exciting at first, but it quickly makes everywhere feel the same.2. To quote Lao Tzu, when your work is done, forget it. If you work remotely, actively disconnect at the end of the day. It&#39;s too easy to be constantly plugged into the English-speaking media world and ignore what&#39;s right in front of you.3. Try to blend in and adopt local clothing, culture, foods, etc. Read books by local authors, watch local films. A bit obvious, maybe, but I&#39;ve met many people who insisted on only eating Western food, reading Harry Potter, and watching Netflix while abroad. At that point, why even bother traveling?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"When I quit my job and went travelling I used this framework:1. Go via land. You see everything in between all the places you should see as a tourist. You immerse yourself in how a place actually feels. You meet people who aren’t just trying to extract money from you. I cycled, because I like cycling, but any form of transport works.2. My algorithm was something like “Go east. Stay somewhere if it’s interesting, until you get bored. Continue going east.” I didn’t have a fixed itinerary, but I did have some framework.That was the basis of it, I think. I cycled from London to Italy, stopped for a while in Italy, cycled on to Greece, then fell in love (with the place and somebody in particular). I met some of my best friends, worked on side projects, volunteered for charities, and ended up staying there for several months. I skipped forward to India on a plane, cycled across India, then returned back to Greece.My partner in Greece wanted to visit the Middle East and Central Asia, but she wasn’t quite as excited about cycling through the desert as I was, so we bought a van and drove — to Central Asia, and everything in between.My framework worked extraordinarily well. If I have one regret, I think it was not making an effort to interact with more people. You do that a lot more naturally when travelling by land, but you still need to put in effort to make it happen.For example, I was up late in a bar in an Italian village, and met one of the locals. It was a long cycle ride back to the place I was staying so he offered me his spare room. Turns out he lived with his parents and the next day his elderly Italian mother cooked us pasta for lunch. Possibly one of the best meals of my life.I wish I had done more of that. Just hanging out in bars and making friends. And not tourist bars — real bars. Knowing the local language better would probably help."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Did not quit my job, but instead went full remote in 2018 (age 55 at the time).Still doing it, but the pandemic forced me to stay in one country for just about a year now.In that year I put down roots, got long term visas and maybe will spend another few years there while we see how things shape out this and next year.But ya, 2-3 months minimum in a place is what you need, with just a small backpack.Make local friends.Don&#39;t hang around or go out with other tourists or expats. This is the kiss of death.Make it a rule to eat only the food of the city or the country that you find yourself in.Learn a few words of the language &#34;hello&#34;, &#34;thank you&#34;, &#34;bathroom&#34;, &#34;stop&#34;, etc.Don&#39;t think people are less than you. They&#39;re not. They want the same things as you.As an introvert, being forced to make friends with people who speak another language and look the opposite of me (black guy in Asia), was exactly the ticket.Well recommended to do it.The main thing I would say - is have a mission when you travel. Seeing the sights and drinking the bars and mingling with other tourists and shtupping the local girls is fun, but not a mission.You will get bored after some time of doing that.Have some particular work or meaning to each day to keep you grounded, and you can do the moving around for a super-long time.You will find that you&#39;ll set some schedules for work, play and discoveries - regardless of where you are.Just don&#39;t quit your job. Instead go remote (even if you have savings). Ok?"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I once wrote a negative review of a business on Google, and it went up, but when I went to look at the business&#39;s reviews under my wife&#39;s Google account, it was not there. I waited an hour and checked. Then a couple hours and checked. Then a day. It never showed up.I posted the review under her account and did the same checks for my account. It never showed up.I do not know why it didn&#39;t show up, but I wouldn&#39;t be surprised if the business had been able to pay money to Google to be able to check reviews before they went live and mark them as spam.Edit: Because some commenters did not seem to get the implied message, what I am actually implying is that in this context, or any context, I don&#39;t trust Google. I have no evidence of what commenters said I have claimed. (I have not claimed anything; I just said I wouldn&#39;t be surprised.)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"My personal experience as a business owner. We do not care about reviews since we are a B2B software house. Our customers are mid- to large-size companies so they do not play reviews but lawyers if our service wasn&#39;t of highest quality :) My personal preference would be to prevent 3rd party companies like google from publishing reviews if the business owner doesn&#39;t want them.Anyway - no customer gave us any review on google and our website is full of recommendation letters. But at some point google started nagging our employees to put reviews since they visited our office.Guess what happened. We got our first review from an employee we were not happy with and planned to gracefully close our cooperation with.This is against Google policy. So we complained. We had to spend significant time to get to a real person at Google and get this removed.After a year similar situation happened. I thought ok - this should be easy the second time. No way - this time all the emails we knew did not respond, we could not reach anybody. We flagged the review several times. We could not do anything about that.It is like a person can just put a shit on your office wall and you could not clean it. And shit owner - Google doesn&#39;t care.We were forced to play by the rules and we bought 50 reviews to paint our wall. The company that provided this service was a Google partner. They explained that 80-90% of reviews of everything is written for money.And the best thing - once we started getting our reviews, the flagged reviews were finally removed. Seems like AI decided the we are a good company.Do you think we did something wrong? Immoral? Or just played business on a not leveled field?And to summarize. I do not care about reviews. And we have money to fight back with lawyers or PR. But it is sad that some businesses don&#39;t have this option and somebody (Google) can harm them through reviews they did not ask for."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"An interesting thing about paid reviews - you can prove that the reviews are fake, but you usually can&#39;t prove that the business itself actually paid for those reviews. In a hypothetical world where companies with fake reviews are regularly discovered and lambasted in public, it&#39;s easy to imagine a sinister metagame where unscrupulous small businesses can buy bad good reviews (i.e. 5-star reviews that are obviously fake) for their competitors to make them seem sketchy. The folks selling the fake reviews certainly don&#39;t care who&#39;s paying. There&#39;s no obvious solution to me for that potential problem aside from stopping fake reviews before they&#39;re posted (which feels like the kind of thing that&#39;s much harder than it sounds); thankfully it doesn&#39;t appear to be a very common thing yet."</p>

But I log in to turn these off and the ones I&#39;d touched before were back on.Increasingly, the &#34;if you&#39;re not paying then you&#39;re the product&#34; saying is bunk.  I am paying, almost $400 per month, for quite a few SIMs to be active on T-Mobile&#39;s network yet that&#39;s not enough.

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Why do giant companies do so many hilariously dumb things?As organizational complexity increases, design debt and responsibility becomes diffused among larger and larger groups of people. Leading to the bizarre situation where no individual has power or responsibility over anything specifically.Any individual interface element might have taken input from as many as 100+ different people over many years, each with competing interests and goals (no, I&#39;m not joking). Combine this with the precedents and decisions made on projects in the past (design debt), and you end up with stupid outcomes like this.As a multiple FAANG alumni, I&#39;ve seen this firsthand hundreds of times.I think it&#39;s cute that people think IC designers or engineers have the power to make any real decisions inside large organizations.What&#39;s more likely, is these stupid icons were part of some design system somebody created 7 years ago (have to stay consistent of course!). The circular floating buttons were a precedent somebody set 5 years ago on a completely different product (god forbid it feels &#34;off-brand&#34;). The colors were set 6 years ago on some project where this kind of application was never thought of.And finally, the order &amp; placement of the icons was changed 15 times by some PM, then the PM&#39;s boss, then the accessibility guys, then the brand team, the brand team&#39;s boss, then the director of marketing, etc. etc. The tie breaking vote going to whoever is perceived as having more soft power inside the org at the time.Hence, the inevitable outcome of big company stupidity."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I just had an idea that might explain why this happens.Firstly, I&#39;ve observed a phenomenon when I talk to a programmer about a problem I want to solve. They might get excited, learn a bit of the problem domain and then go off and build something that kind of solves part of my problem. But then I&#39;m stuck in a endless cycle of explaining the rest of the problem, to someone who isn&#39;t really interested, then waiting for a new iteration and then evaluating how it doesn&#39;t completely the solve the problem until the programmer gets bored and goes off to find something new and exciting to do with computers. Programming the computerwas always the end for them. They don&#39;t actually care about the problem. I care about the problem. So for me computers are a tool to solve my problem. I might as well write the program myself because it&#39;s less work to become a mediocre programmer than to intimately understand the problem.My theory is that something like this happens in interface design. There are  designers who love to create beautiful designs, and we love that, but beauty is the end of it for them. They don&#39;t actually care about the problem that the program (website, app, whatever) is supposed to solve. If they were stuck in a job filling out forms all day they would quickly learn the lesson to put the reset button out of the way. If they were intimately familiar with the problem, the better design would be obvious. And so it is that people with no &#34;design skills&#34; can point out the obvious mistakes of the designers.It&#39;s also true that good design is hard. Starting with a blank sheet and creating something, let alone something good, is daunting. Perhaps the hardest part is having the humility to admit, &#34;I don&#39;t understand the problem sufficiently&#34; and the empathy to care about the problem enough to learn it well."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Phoenix is practically built with this idea in mind.My startup is built out of a single phoenix monolith. Only external dependency is postgres.Despite this, I&#39;ve managed to completely avoid all the typical scaling issues of a monolith. Need a service or background worker? I juts make a Genserver or Oban worker and mount it in the supervision tree. The Beam takes care of maintaining the process, pubsub to said service and error handling in the event of a crash.I&#39;m basicly getting all the best advantages of a monolith* one codebase to navigate, our team is TINY
* all functionality is in librariesAnd all the advantages of microservices without the associated costs. (orchestration, management etc)* bottleneck use cases can live on their own nodes* publish subscribe to dispatch background jobs* services that each focus on doing one thing really wellWe&#39;ve accomplished this all through just libraries and a little bit of configuration. At no point so far have we had to..* setup a message broker (phoenix pubsub has been fine for us. we can send messages between different processes on the server and to the clients themselves over channels)* setup external clusters for background workers. (Oban was drop in and jsut works. I&#39;m able to add a new worker without having to tell devops anything. the supervision tree allocates the memory for the process and takes care of fault tolerance for me. That leaves me to focus on solving the business problems)* setup a second github repo. Its a monorepo and at out scale, its fine. We have one library for communicating to the database that every system just uses.Eventually we&#39;ll probably have to start rethinking and building out separate services. But I&#39;m happy that we&#39;re already able to get some of teh benefits of a microservice architecture while sticking to what makes monoliths great for mvps. It will be awhile before we need to think about scaling out web service. It just works. Leaves me more time to work on tuning out database to keep up!"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Write libraries AND services, where it makes sense.I wrote a Python library to scrape google news [0]We also have it as a service [1]Want to know why? Because devs who can&#39;t pay won&#39;t pay. Businesses who can pay will rather pay for a service (API in our case), and not care about maintaining it.[0] https://github.com/kotartemiy/pygooglenews[1] https://newscatcherapi.com/google-news-api"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is a bad take and a false dichotomy. The reasons for choosing a library or a service are so myriad and context-dependent that any generalization about which is &#34;better&#34; is just silliness. It&#39;s like saying, &#34;If you have to get somewhere, running is better than walking.&#34; Sure, in the case of a race or escaping a predator, running is probably the best option. But what if you want to take in the sights or you can&#39;t sweat in your clothes? Running would be a bad choice, even though it&#39;s faster. There are just too many variables in the real world to make any sort of blanket statement about which approach is &#34;better.&#34;"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I felt the article undersold an important technical detail about this work. Many randomized algorithms have a &#34;with high probability&#34; guarantee, which for linear systems might look like:    for any ε &gt; 0 and 0 &lt; δ &lt; 1, using poly(dimension, #nonzeros, condition, 1/ε, 1/δ) floating-point operations, our algorithm finds a solution having less than ε error with probability 1 - δ.

However, that is not the kind of guarantee stated in Theorem 1.1 in the paper. Even though the algorithm uses randomness, the analysis yields a classic big-O complexity guarantee that does not involve probabilities.This is a big difference, and it makes the result stronger."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"There&#39;s a great opportunity to not just reimplement the GNU coreutils but to actually rethink them. The way I install a Linux system these days and then immediately download ripgrep or fd reminds me of how the first thing I used to do on a Solaris system was install bash and the GNU coreutils. There&#39;s a rich history of doing this - BSD Unix started as a bunch of utilities and patches to the AT&amp;T version, it only became a freestanding distro with its own kernel later on. And the GNU coreutils go way back before the Linux kernel - you just installed them on a commercial Unix to make it more usable. In both cases they went beyond just drop-in replacements and started adding lots of new features and flags. Things have been pretty static for a long time so it&#39;s good to see some innovations coming."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The goal of modernizing coreutils is great, and doing it in rust is even better. However, it makes me very sad that this is licensed under the MIT licence.Being licensed under the GPL is an essential part of the GNU project and their philosophy. Of course everyone is free to do as they please. However, IMHO, if one appreciates the GNU project and the ideals it stands for, then, maybe, it could be preferable not to rewrite parts of it under weaker licences that go directly against their mission!"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"People are all talking about how it&#39;s useful for quick stuff with datasets, but it goes far beyond that. It&#39;s useful for quick anything you might want a small database for. Imagination is the limit.For example, if any of you play D&amp;D online, you might be familiar with dndbeyond&#39;s character sheets. They&#39;re a fantastic way to onboard new players who might not have the inclination to spend hours with the rule books before they even start playing. It does all the calculations for you and gives you some buttons like &#34;roll athletics&#34; and doesn&#39;t let you add more spells than your character can have with their stats.I recently persuaded some friends to give FATE a try and built analogous push-button character sheets with google sheets [0]. It was quick and simple. With conditional formatting, you highlight bad states (rules say you can&#39;t have more of X than Y!). With the script editor, you can add full on buttons for dice rolls and other state changes with whatever logic you want (anything you can code up!). Checkboxes are obvious but super useful. And the transparency of the calculations is helpful for teaching people the system (this stat is &#34;min(A4, B1+C5)&#34;).Without google sheets, it would be a serious endeavor to build a stateful, database backed, live collaborative GUI that can be added to and customized on the fly by my users. With google sheets, it was a quick fun afternoon hack. Excel/google sheets is an amazing piece of technology.[0] Screenshot of the &#34;app&#34;: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/imh/public_images/main/Scr..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I hadn&#39;t used Excel in years and now that I do, there&#39;s some things about it that drive me nuts:- It forgets what you&#39;ve copied to clipboard. Copy something. Insert another row so that there&#39;s space for it. Paste. Nothing happens. Huh? It lost my copy. It does this for a large number of operations and it drives me crazy. I&#39;ve never seen any other program do this.- You can&#39;t open two spreadsheets of the same name. This is because spreadsheet formulas can refer to cells in other tables. But I don&#39;t use that feature - can&#39;t I just open the second spreadsheet with a warning that this feature won&#39;t apply to it?- (This one applies to too many pieces of Microsoft technology.) You can&#39;t use common keyboard shortcuts properly. Ctrl-backspace deletes a word in any useful text box. Not in formula editing in excel. And ctrl+delete deletes the rest of the line instead of just the next word. Why?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Excel, and more importantly, the spreadsheet is the best way to build intuition for a dataset, hands down. The alternatives, especially when it comes to Python and the default pandas output in a Jupyter Notebook are horrendous.Where Excel falls short, is data size limitations + auditability. Putting more than 1M rows of data into Excel is not possible, and once you get into the low 100K&#39;s, it becomes almost unbearable. And handing off an Excel workbooks to a colleague is handing them hours of cell dependency tracing. On the other hand, data size + auditability are the super powers of Python data analysis.I&#39;ve been building a Python package, Mito (https://trymito.io/), its an interactive spreadsheet that automatically converts your spreadsheet analysis to the equivalent pandas code. You can write spreadsheet formulas, merge datasets, create pivot tables, etc. And because its implemented in Python, you can manipulate datasets with 10M rows of data with no problem. Our goal is to bring the intuitiveness of Excel data manipulation to Pandas."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Googlers are like toddlers with all the toys in the world: they quickly get bored and move on.I&#39;m reminded of Paul Graham&#39;s essays about this and payments ticks two of the major themes: it&#39;s both unsexy and it&#39;s a schlep. And that&#39;s why Google won&#39;t succeed in this space.Apple uniquely seems to have maintained the ability to tackle these problems. I remember when Apple Pay launched and was derided (here and elsewhere) but every few weeks there&#39;d be another announcement where another group of financial institutions were brought in to the ecosystem. You keep plugging away at that, customers will start using it and after years of schlep you&#39;ll have mature payments infrastructure.Google chat apps were a meme internally even when I was still there (2017). Deprecating Hangouts features, copying Slack, creating new orgs to make the same mistakes all over again (but hey, lots of people got promoted). It was a joke and still is.And all they had to do was copy iMessage. That&#39;s it. Apple had the foresight, market power and wherewithal to push iMessage onto resistant network operators (who were all too happy to continue nickel-and-diming customers with massively profitable SMS charges long after any cost arguments had disappeared)."</p>

Their internal promotion/reward structure must be utterly broken that this exact scenario seems to keep playing out time and time again.

How many factories, data centers, companies, and products have you seen that are ISO-something certified?It’s an entire industry, of course part of that process is paying to get the specification that you’re already paying for someone to verify you’re abiding by.The last time I went through an audit the consulting firm that was auditing us only very begrudgingly gave us the requirements for a couple of sections because we kept insisting that we were providing proof that we met them and they kept disagreeing. I still think it was just to shut us up...As they mention in the tweet, you can possibly get them from the standards body in your country. For my current country (Estonia) they don’t seem to give it out freely, but you can buy the version they approved as the country’s standard for like €20, compared with the €200 for the official ISO version.

Even a 1W laser is dangerous to eyesight, if it was being fired at targets mingling with people.The system could be mounted on small drones that would patrol larger areas - but the idea of robotic drones armed with lasers roaming around is beginning to sound worse than the mosquitos."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is a nice little firestarter.I&#39;ve had this idea many years ago and my solution to that problem was to use two or more lasers of lower power that all shoot at the same point in 3 dimensional space.

								<p class="story__comment_others">"You can do this with sound.   A hybrid system even better.I built tech ~10 years ago to track quiet, sound emitting objects in real time to sub CM resolution using microphone arrays.  And in one demo I even had a laser pointer mounted on a 2 axis.... &#34;swinging thingie&#34; (sorry, I&#39;m not a mech-E) which would constantly stay pointed on the loudest object in the room, as it moved.  Fun stuff.  Creepy even.Shame I never found a use or a buyer for the tech. :/EDIT:  I bet an improved hybrid one would use sound to get within the right 1-2cm, with a zoom camera mounted on the pan/tilt apparatus to get it even more accurate."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Finally this is getting some attention. Somewhat related, Healthcare startups are struggling with this because the standards they have to comply with (for developing medical software) cost up to 280 EUR (for a pdf!). [1]One common workaround is to go to &#34;the Estonian site&#34; which offers the same, English version of standards for a much lower price [2].  Being a bit cynical, I would say that Estonia prioritises open information much more highly than.. other developed countries. I created a price comparison on my website [3].But: The core problem of standards being openly available is still not solved. Why is this not possible? For me, standards are very comparable to the law: A large number of people should comply with it. For that, they must be openly available to everyone. Everything else doesn&#39;t make sense. Is that unreasonable?[1] https://www.iso.org/standard/38421.html
[2] https://www.evs.ee/en/
[3] https://openregulatory.com/accessing-standards/"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The price of standards makes me angry. They&#39;re essentially a form of legislation in many countries - to sell anything in the EU you have to comply with the relevant safety standards. Yet they&#39;re kept under lock and key - to read the rules which you need to follow to sell something in your own country, you need to pay a 3rd party hundreds of Euros.And when you read the standards, they reference other standards. Eventually you have to build a graph of standards to which you must comply, each one costing hundreds of Euros. It&#39;s a complete racket.The worst thing is that the standards themselves tend to be written by 3rd party organisations with an interest in that domain, so they have a strong incentive to make the standard match with whatever they&#39;re doing. So not only does a new startup have to spend months reading hugely expensive dry safety standards, you also have to build something which is essentially a worse version of the incumbents."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; The value of standards is in their adoption.Tim Sweeney correctly observes this, then continues to talk about &#34;millions of hobbyist programmers&#34;. I do not believe that ISO targets, or even has any remote interest, in this market.ISO is comprised of nation-state members who will inevitably mandate ISO standards as part of legal compliance. Various stakeholders actually participate in standardization efforts and thus also both already know the standard and are able to push it through. All of these categories (government, industries in highly regulated sectors and large stakeholders) have large amounts of capital. The amount of money required to fund a purchase of an ISO standard barely even factors in on a balance sheet.Hobbyist programmers arguably make a lot of open source software that builds the foundation for today&#39;s and tomorrow&#39;s platforms. However, when the big bulldozers from the previous paragraph roll in, hobbyist programmers give way to highly paid employees of these giants; be it by merging a patch or be it by being worked around with a greenfield project or fork.On the other hand, ISO has an incentive in charging money for their standards because this adds perceived value: If something is freely available, it is easier to dismiss it as a non-serious effort when debating whether it is worth to bind personnel for participation in the standards committees; the standards come across as valueless, worthless.Looking at this vector of interests of the various parties involved, I see little reason for this state of affairs to improve."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Bitcoin is a beautiful concept that has been bastardized by economies of scale. The mining concentration is decreasing its security over time. The centralized block structure and exorbitant fees will afflict it more and more as it grows.Even arguments about renewable energy being used to mine BTC are moot, because they don&#39;t consider the opportunity cost of what could be done with all that energy instead.I truly believe in a decentralized means of exchange, but Bitcoin is the Encarta equivalent. There already is a Wikipedia equivalent, all it takes is a little research. Once you find it, you will know. I won&#39;t shill here, as I don&#39;t want that to dilute the points of Bitcoin&#39;s increasingly problematic issues due to its growing scale.That being said, the cryptoverse is drowning in sh*tcoins, and I completely understand anyone even remotely mentioning an alternative to Bitcoin being inevitably categorized as a shiller and therefore not worth listening to."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Just the other day I was in my logistics class and the professor started deviating into something that I believe was pure nonsense.He started the lecture by analyzing how many pieces a machine could manufacture per day. Fair enough. He extended the model to measure different ratios of capacity. Makes sense.Then he tried to extend the model to all machines, including humans. His example was: &#34;How do you measure the capacity of a legal team?&#34;. I thought it was a trick question, so I answered (paraphrasing) &#34;You can&#39;t answer that question the same way you answer for the machine. You can&#39;t give a single metric.&#34; He told me I was wrong and that the _right_ measure would be (total number of working hours/day).I was tempted to try to convince him otherwise. The analogy was deeply flawed. He certainly measured the machines in (number of pieces / day) but measured the legal team in (hours/day). So, in analyzing a machine, you take into account its efficiency, but you don&#39;t do the same thing for humans.I believe that is exactly the same thing that is going on in the post. Managers/Logistics/Economists are very susceptible to this kind of generalization pitfalls.Edit: Given that this answer has generated some discussion I feel the need to expand on it. The legal team was not expected to sell their services &#34;by the hour&#34;. In fact, any discussion about how their services were sold was shut down by the professor. From his point of view, the lawyers were machines and he was asking the question &#34;how much can this machine produce?&#34;Yes, other students also suggested taking the number of billable hours/revenue into account, but that&#39;s not the answer the professor was looking for.I don&#39;t criticize whether his answer is not technically right, but I feel it holds no real-world meaning. It was a purely academic question that leads nowhere instead of having a debate about how you measure the productivity of a group of human beings. And on top of that, his final answer was definitive and (from his point of view) was irrefutable."</p>

The file was 15 years old and had been modified by many people since. There were conditionals that were impossible to hit, features that had been abandoned years ago, duplicate code, and lots of comments that didn’t match the code anymore. After my changes and a few new tests, the driver had full MCDC code coverage and the code actually matched the device specification!"</p>

Black Pepper prices have jumped 20+% in the last 20day that price is still 50% cheaper than what it was 4-5 years ago. The largest problem is not availablity of goods rather shipping. I would advise investing in shipping companies if you are active in the stock market.

								<p class="story__comment_others">"CPI is a joke, they do something called hedonic adjustments to things like tech products etc. It&#39;s completely subjective and BS. Technology is deflationary, things should get cheaper because we go after producing them in creative ways one demand is high.CPI is absurd, it only perpetuates consumerism and punishes savers.
We product 2x the food society consumes - mostly wasted away, just with some supply chain efficiency - there&#39;s a lot more room for food not to be expensive though."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Nice work!I&#39;m about 1850 in Lichess blitz, and it played at the level of an earnest 12 year old, which is actually meant as a compliment. It got crazy with its kingside pawns in the opening (no book knowledge), lost material pretty steadily and was checkmated down a queen, bishop and two pawns by move 25.But it developed some pieces sensibly, made obvious recaptures and was not reckless about king safety. It avoided pointless toggling moves and suicidal piece jettisoning.You&#39;ve earned the right to be a proud papa on this one."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Sharing other people&#39;s amazement that such a tiny amount of code plays so well (I&#39;m an inexperienced, infrequent player and it beat me once and drew once), I was pondering that there&#39;s no absolute reason to think that small programs inherently must play games poorly. For many abstract strategy games, you could write an explicit game tree search in a relatively small amount of code and it would, in principle, play perfectly if you somehow gave it enough time to search the whole game tree. (That wouldn&#39;t be feasible for most abstract strategy games that human beings like to play, but would for small games like Tic-Tac-Toe, Hexapawn or Octapawn, Nine Men&#39;s Morris, maybe Hex on a small board.)In GOFAI (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symbolic_artificial_intelligen...) there&#39;s a clear pattern where &#34;intelligence&#34; in abstract strategy games represents, in part, being able to prune game trees well without having to search them exhaustively. In some cases that means having a good evaluation function for positions, and in other cases having a cleverer search strategy in another way.Thinking about this made me realize that it&#39;s not just impressive that this program plays decently while being tiny, but especially that it plays decently and quickly while being tiny."</p>

It&#39;s not wrong, of course, but it&#39;s been repeated for many years and won&#39;t lead to fresh conversation.The goal on HN is curious conversation. Curiosity likes diffs [1], not generics [2, 3]. Try to comment in a way that leads to a new place rather than an old place.The easiest way to do this is to respond to the specific new information in an article. As a nudge in that direction, I&#39;ve swapped a different interrogative pronoun into the title, and have downweighted the generic subthreads which were rising to the top like bloated balloons and crowding out more interesting discussion (as typically happens in these cases).You don&#39;t only have to react to the specific new information in an article.

If ever something went catastrophically wrong with youtube this could be reactivated via the feed* He has a large email list which he uses to reach people directly and drive traffic to videos if people request these updates* He is also prominent on twitter etc and maintains secondary youtube channels, useful if main one taken down* He runs a large subreddit for his followingSo it is layers and layers of redundancy, built on a mix of other platforms and also two he controls directly (email and rss)Still faces a youtube risk but it would take a an earthquake across platforms to truly wreck his income streams.As someone who runs an online business and follows him it’s been impressive to watch how diversified he has made his comms channels."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; Linus SebastianSomething to understand, for those who might have just seen some youtube videos of him being goofy, is that he&#39;s an actor. The guy on camera doing stupid stuff is a stage persona. It&#39;s an intentionally cultivated image and media persona to get as many video views as possible.I sort of see him as one possible aspect of the low/medium budget TV production stuff which is common in his home city, Vancouver BC. People who&#39;ve met and worked with him in person report that he&#39;s a much more normal, calm, rational individual off screen.I won&#39;t judge him for being goofy on camera because it&#39;s hard to make a living as a working actor. For every person who gets a job in a vancouver-produced TV drama that might last 2 or 3 seasons, there&#39;s dozens more people who are working as restaurant servers while trying to get their big break."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I have a similar feeling, but with modern smartphones.Owning my computer is still relatively possible. I can build a computer from parts which I can choose, and have a choice in which operating system to install on them. Laptops are slightly more closed, but even on those I can choose the OS myself.Modern smartphones however, seem like walled gardens in which I have no control at all. I cannot choose any of the parts, and even doing simple reparation tasks like replacing a battery is a nightmare these days. I am locked into a single OS on my smartphone, which either spies on you or is locked down even more. Every iteration a bit more control is taken away from the user. And its increasingly hard to step away from them, since a lot of normal interactions such as banking almost requires you to have such a phone.Both Android and iOS suck. I&#39;ve made my own Android phone tolerable with F-Droid and trying to ungoogle it as much as possible. But unfortunately I find myself locked into using google play services since solutions like MicroG just don&#39;t cut it. They lock me out of slightly too much of my daily smartphone usage (note that this is definitely not the MicroG&#39;s developers fault, they have done amazing work)."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"NFTs make perfect sense for representing a claim on things that can be used, like event tickets or in-game virtual goods. But as certificates layered on top of collectibles... I&#39;m not so sure.With something like CryptoKitties, you can do something with the tokens (play a virtual pet game). But with something like CryptoPunks you&#39;re essentially paying for digital beanie babies, which are worse than real ones since anyone can display and enjoy the image you paid for.You can brag about owning such-and-such an image, but only as long as enough other people desire images from that particular set. When a set&#39;s popularity wanes, so does your token&#39;s value, and your ability to show it off.I&#39;m always happy to see artists being paid for their work, and if they can make some money during this craze - more power to them. Beyond a few creators being rewarded, it seems like this is going to be 90% bubble (with plenty of hucksters), and 10% real use cases that stand the test of time."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Pretty bad take on NFTs.There are numerous configurations, networks, and commercial structures that can be created for NFT offerings that can mitigate &#34;problems&#34; described in the OP and accommodate for different tradeoffs.A simple retort would point to the many alternative NFT networks that don&#39;t use POW-based consensus algorithms or the NFT offerings that enable value add offerings very differently than purchasing art or baseball cards.Evaluating the capabilities of NFTs against the value offerings of something like rare art is an apples to oranges comparison. Of course the market for digital assets offered via NFT is immature and speculative; this is a new market, based on an alternative technology paradigm, that has a long way to go before it settles into a more usable and valuable structure.Ultimately, the idea of using key-pairs pegged to widely accessible peer-to-peer public networks as a mechanism for tracking ownership of digital (or near digital or at times even physical) assets is incredibly novel. It turns the conventional model of third-party hosted digital assets on its head and enables really interesting mechanisms of distribution, ownership, access, and value consumption and creation that does not compare well with traditional mechanisms. And in saying it doesn&#39;t compare well I mean to acknowledge its limitations and its potential at the same time. However, the critique in the OP is pretty bland and doesn&#39;t seem to acknowledge the full scope of the situation."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Having distinct types for P0 and P1 is deliberate and is what is called &#34;type state programming&#34; in the embedded rust book [0]. The advantage is that you can prevent misconfiguration at compile time  (ensuring that a given pin cannot be used in multiple places). In the Zig example, it seems to me (and I have zero knowledge of Zig, so sorry if this is inaccurate) that you can potentially introduce bugs where the same pin is used twice.For a generic led driver, it should not use these types, but instead the trait types from the embedded_hal crate, such as &#34;OutputPin&#34; that is implemented by the different chip-specific HALs. There is an example of a generic led driver that uses these traits at [1].In general I recommend everyone who wants to try out Rust on embedded to read the embedded rust book, because it clarifies a lot of the reasons and advantages of its approach.[0] https://docs.rust-embedded.org/book/static-guarantees/typest...[1] https://github.com/drogue-iot/drogue-device/blob/main/rt/src..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Here&#39;s another example of the coolness of Zig&#39;s comptime code execution:https://github.com/ziglang/zig/commit/0808d98e10c5fea27cebf9...That&#39;s a generic container class (similar to vector in C++ or List in C#). But! With a twist!It stores structs in &#34;column major&#34; order in memory (e.g., if a struct had two fields A and B, then in-memory layout would be A...AB...B), and you can idiomatically and efficiently get a a slice of the values of each column.I.e., it&#39;s a datastructure that automatically applies the struct-of-arrays optimization:https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/AoS_and_SoA#Structure_of_Arr...And the code to do it is straightforward, normal Zig.Pretty awesome stuff!"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Zig&#39;s design is so radical, that it completely rethinks how low-level programming can and should be done, rather than improve on one of the existing low-level programming philosophies (C or C++&#39;s). That the result is such a simple and easy-to-learn language that, despite being so radical, doesn&#39;t feel foreign is truly an accomplishment.&gt; In particular, that much of the complexity I’d unconsciously attributed to the domain — “this is what systems programming is like” — was in fact a consequence of deliberate Rust design decisions.I also thought that, and, to be fair to Rust, it is following the tradition of C++ and Ada, two low-level languages that would also easily make the top five most complex languages in history alongside Rust. Until Zig showed up, I, and I think many others, didn&#39;t believe that an expressive low-level language could be made so simple, certainly not one that values safety."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I got the privilege of having lunch with Mr. McDonald when I was an IEEE officer during college. He gave a lecture at my university on ethics, and the IEEE council got to take him for lunch afterwards.He was not shy at all about saying whatever was on his mind. It was pretty awesome to hear him dunk on his VP, right in the middle of lying to the Rogers commission&#39;s face. He was also really open about the fact that nobody at Morton Thiokol trusted him for the better part of a decade after he did that. He said something to the effect of, &#34;It definitely made my career harder, but on the bright side, I never had any major crises of conscience for lying about it.He also didn&#39;t give a single fuck about getting a lunch beer at a student gathering. I wish I&#39;d joined him in drinking beer at noon on a Tuesday on IEEE dime."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The film “Challenger: The Final Flight” on Netflix includes interviews with the most important participants in the launch decision, including McDonald. (It also has interviews with many of the astronauts’ families and does a great job at putting their experience front and centre.)The guy whose job it was to send the fax because he happened to be the one who knew how to operate the fax machine is to this day utterly devastated; weeping.The MTI VP who signed off (although the decision was made above his head) admits that he agreed with it at the time, but acknowledges it was a mistake. He’s being interviewed in a large room full of very expensive furniture.The NASA manager who bullied them into agreeing to launch because they couldn’t prove that it was unsafe basically says that if he had his time over he would kill all of the astronauts again. Truly terrifying."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The actual Feynman personal take on risk &amp; his investigation:https://history.nasa.gov/rogersrep/v2appf.htmShort and readable.  It appears that there are enormous differences of opinion as to the probability of a failure with loss of vehicle and of human life. The estimates range from roughly 1 in 100 to 1 in 100,000. The higher figures come from the working engineers, and the very low figures from management. What are the causes and consequences of this lack of agreement? Since 1 part in 100,000 would imply that one could put a Shuttle up each day for 300 years expecting to lose only one, we could properly ask &#34;What is the cause of management&#39;s fantastic faith in the machinery?&#34;

...  For a successful technology, reality must take precedence over public relations, for nature cannot be fooled."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Switzerland has an awesome electoral system [1].  Instead of being ruled by a president or a prime minister who can be polarising, divisive, or selective, Switzerland has an Executive Council.The 7 member Executive Council is composed of the top 7 candidates from each election.  The chairperson of the executive council rotates each year, so that the top 4 vote winners each get a turn at being chairperson.This means that different social and political priorities get implemented in turn.  It also means the way the government works is more cooperative, because each council member, including the chairperson, knows there will be a new chairperson next year.So, if a pro-business candidate places 1st, and an environment candidate 2nd, and a social welfare candidate 3rd, and a libertarian candidate 4th, it is in all their interests to cooperate and create legislation that serves all of their interests as much as possible.  Instead of disregarding the environment, the pro-business council member is encouraged to develop green business initiatives that will be supported for the full 4 year term under the different chairs.The system creates a leadership team that looks for win-win, rather than a sole victor who can abuse majority rule.[1]. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Council_(Switzerland)"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&gt; From a distance, procrastination looks like a time management problem. There is growing evidence that it is rather an emotional management problem — a flight response.It&#39;s eye opening how a lot of life struggles turn out to be an emotional management problem at their core: procrastination, addiction, stress.I wish I had that perspective earlier in my life. It completely changes the solution space from trying random productivity tools to focusing on one&#39;s emotions and possibly getting into therapy."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is all true but but I&#39;ve been recently been diagnosed with adult adhd in my mid-30ies and on a low dose of slow release Methylphenidate and it&#39;s all the difference between getting things done and procrastinating like hell. If you exhausted all the articles and nothing worked and you have big problems for years (like this: https://gekk.info/articles/adhd.html) give it a try. In the last weeks I managed to really learn in a structured way for the first time. Of course it&#39;s no magic solution to all your problems but it&#39;s a stark difference for me. I just want to leave that here as I&#39;ve read these articles every other week and nothing sticked. Neither did counseling or talk theraphy - it helped but didn&#39;t solve the procrastination / time issues"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"One of the interesting things you can do with ffmpeg, if you have a LOT of scratch disk space, and you&#39;re trying to compare subjective encoder quality (not VMAF, but human eyeballs) on a certain video file:1) take your raw uncompressed y4m file and write it out to a directory of PNG files, one png file per frame. this is your static image reference baseline for subjective eyeballs.2) take your raw uncompressed y4m file and encode it to x265 or whatever codec you&#39;re testing, at various different bitrates and encoder settings3) take your various encoded x265 files and also write those out to PNG files in separate directories3) pick exactly the same frame number filename from your &#39;master&#39; PNGs and your encoder-output PNGs, copy them and put them in the same directory so you can quickly flip back and forth between them in a image slideshow application.If you want to do this with 2160p24,p25 or p30 videos at several minute lengths, be prepared to have 150-160GB of scratch disk per y4m and per PNG-dump-directory."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"If this book does what it claims to do, it should probably cost more (pls raise the price after I buy it). I strongly believe that inside ffmpeg may be the secret to the cosmos, the universe and life itself"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&gt; [Julia] was a bold-looking girl, of about twenty-seven, with thick hair, a freckled face, and swift, athletic movements. A narrow scarlet sash, emblem of the Junior Anti-Sex League, was wound several times round the waist of her overalls, just tightly enough to bring out the shapeliness of her hips. Winston had disliked her from the very first moment of seeing her.&gt; Better than before, moreover, he realized why it was that he hated her. He hated her because she was young and pretty and sexless, because he wanted to go to bed with her and would never do so, because round her sweet supple waist, which seemed to ask you to encircle it with your arm, there was only the odious scarlet sash, aggressive symbol of chastity.1984, George Orwell, 1949"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This was a fun read, especially as someone who grew up with those 80s and 90s movies.That said, and as the author touches on, the action/super hero of today is a PG-13 one. Studios need to reach the widest audience possible to make the most money, so it&#39;s a safer bet.Sure, back in the day studios had the same imperative, but the licensed toy game was still young, so they didn&#39;t realise that maybe if they made Die Hard PG instead of R they could sell some John McClane action figures to younger viewiers.Nowadays, that&#39;s basically the starting point; what we can we sell outside of the movie? how can we milk the franchise for as much as possible?And that&#39;s where a lot of the sex appeal is lost. Marvel movies can&#39;t be as raunchy as a result.Another topic that the author touched on was the way the ideal aesthetic has changed in not just our bodies but where we live or what we do in our spare time.I agree that more and more we are optimising for artifice; fitness classes, extra curricular activities, holidays, concerts and events we attend, just to keep up an appearance online or in person. And in those activities we often don&#39;t get the true value out of them because we&#39;re doing them for the wrong reason.Anyway, it&#39;s a complex and interesting topic and I&#39;d love to read more about this perhaps from even further back (50s or 60s) if anyone has something similar to this post?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Seriously? Selective sampling and click bait.Two recent programs come to mind and I&#39;m sure this list is not exhaustive. &#34;The boys&#34; and &#34;Orville&#34;. Both chock full of &#34;heroes&#34; who in-between being heroes are preoccupied with banging each other, getting drunk, eating or failing themselves. The last episode of &#34;The Boys&#34; ends with Homelander jerking off while perched on a ledge over the city and raging at the unfairness of life. It&#39;s certainly a comment on the blandness of the Marvel universe and Orville is a superior and cutting rip off of Star Trek which has become bland and inoffensive in it&#39;s latest incarnations. Orville cuts pretty close to the limit for whatever rating it has. The two &#34;gay&#34; aliens and the holodeck porn episode come to mind. It was done fairly well. Stressed out officer on a star ship gets a holodeck porn addiction and is no longer able to relate to or face his life partners demands for attention. It&#39;s not heroic and not glorious but relatively human. Orville&#39;s officers like to fuck. They order booze from the matter synthesizers and they get depressed and do stupid things. Of course it is still &#34;star trek&#34; and there are always happy endings  and everybody learns a lesson at the end. It doesn&#39;t drift too far from the genre.However the article takes a selective slice of current cinematic culture and tries to pretend there are no other options out there whilst at the same time looking back at 80&#39;s and 90&#39;s cinema as if it was the age of body positive cinema."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Been following the creators for awhile and very much happy to see them democratizing their difficult skillset.Most designers -- think anyone using figma -- are effectively locked out of modern interactive and animated visuals due to not knowing hardcore shaders + effective js coding. To get a feel for how hard that is, look at the public timeline of Shirley Wu, another wonderful award-winning designer and experienced js coder, to pick this kind of stuff up. Nodes makes it a lot more accessible, similar to Max/msp for musicians. Once you look beyond the over-claiming, which is clearly nails-on-chalkboard for most engineers and scientists as you are seeing in the comments -- this is a wonderful and enabling project.Extra impressive is they do not seem to try to &#39;dumb it down&#39;. They are a consultancy and (seem to) try to use it for their own bespoke advanced installations. I don&#39;t know how well this will translate to others, but the success of Max msp and super collider make me optimistic that it can grow to those levels. Cycling 74 supports 20+ employees and empowers many musicians, and as Nodes can be used for commercial art (web+tv ads, music videos, landing pages, ...), I can see them being even bigger."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Looks like a new assembly of old ideas that’s different enough it might do better for some purposes. Very exciting.I was about to start prototyping some tool ideas I had in it, but I can’t find it’s source or license info anywhere. By Googling, I found the GitHub repo [0], but it’s empty of code and looks to be used for issue tracking only.I can’t see something that’s trying to be an ecosystem being very successful without being open (see: every closed-source language/runtime ever).I couldn’t even find any example code. I tried clicking the examples on the home page. I even tried clicking “Playground” and it wasn’t a link. The only CTA I could find was “Download Nodes”![0] https://github.com/nodes-io/nodes-io"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Wow, somehow looks similar to another site that I discovered few weeks ago: https://cables.gl/I googled and found this: https://nodes.io/story/#background&gt; When we set off to create a tool of our own, there were already plenty of different node-based or visual scripting/programming tools and environments; VVVV, Houdini, TouchDesigner, Cables.gl, Vizor Patches, Lichen, MaxMSP, UE4 Blueprints and Origami were among the most popular."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"There&#39;s an avalanche of people commenting on this who didn&#39;t bother to check the article before raising their methodological objections, so let&#39;s get these out of the way here.- Yes, they controlled for objects appearing in the pictures that might indicate political affiliation. The images are tightly cropped around the face. See Methods.- Yes, this is significantly better than both a coin flip and a human classifier. They gave the same test to humans, who did much worse than the model. See Abstract, Introduction, and Results.- Yes, this is doing more than just detecting a person&#39;s race, age, and/or gender. The classifier is still accurate when they compare people with the same race, age, and gender. See Results.If you want to discuss actual limitations in the study, here are some the author points out:- &#34;A more detailed picture could be obtained by exploring the links between political orientation and facial features extracted from images taken in a standardized setting while controlling for facial hair, grooming, facial expression, and head orientation.&#34;- &#34;Another factor affecting classification accuracy is the quality of the political orientation estimates. While the dichotomous representation used here (i.e., conservative vs. liberal) is widely used in the literature, it offers only a crude estimate of the complex interpersonal differences in ideology. Moreover, self-reported political labels suffer from the reference group effect: respondents’ tendency to assess their traits in the context of the salient comparison group.&#34;"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This isn&#39;t a study that shows that people&#39;s faces indicate their political leanings.It&#39;s a study which shows that pictures that people select to represent themselves publicly have features that indicate political leaning."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I think the key line is how much better this system is than humans attempting the same task:&gt; Political orientation was correctly classified in 72% of liberal–conservative face pairs, remarkably better than chance (50%), human accuracy (55%), or one afforded by a 100-item personality questionnaire (66%).This isn&#39;t a matter of &#34;recognize that old white people are conservative&#34;, because people will do that already, and they know all those biases. And the system doesn&#39;t lose much accuracy when comparing otherwise similar people.This system is picking up on things we don&#39;t notice. Maybe it&#39;s the photos themselves (they are self-selected), maybe it&#39;s micro expressions in the face, maybe it&#39;s something else entirely.But damn it&#39;s neat and maybe frightening. Imagine if your next hiring manager had a quiet little camera in the corner and chose you based on your predicted approval of unions."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&#34;Just 100 cars will be made available with the technology in Japan, and they will cost the equivalent of $101,900. None of these Legends will make their way to the U.S.&#34;I&#39;m assuming if it won&#39;t come to the US it won&#39;t come to the UK, Canada or Australia either.Is 100 units really a &#34;production car&#34;? I don&#39;t agree.Also:&#34;It does all this with zero input from the driver, who Honda says can &#34;watch television/DVD on the navigation screen or operate the navigation system to search for a destination address.&#34;and yet:&#34;Please do not overestimate the capabilities of each Honda Sensing Elite function and drive safely while paying constant attention to your surroundings. Please remain in condition where you can respond to the handover request issued by the system, and immediately resume driving upon the handover request.&#34;"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"What is notable is level 3. Not the features, but the legal aspect of claiming drivers can now be distracted with your mode.Tesla &#34;auto&#34;pilot does more, while pretending to enforce an always alert driver. This has resulted in a couple wrongful deaths no one at Tesla has been prosecuted for.Honda meanwhile is taking advantage of the Japanese governments legal changes which make level 3 legally tenable. Drivers need not watch the road, but they must respond when the car asks them to. This means Honda is promising your Honda will not silently drive you into a wall as the Tesla autopilot is known to do."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"What&#39;s not mentioned in all the othe english based articles is that Honda&#39;s system only works on highways at speeds below 50km/h. It&#39;s a system specifically designed for dealing with traffic jams on highways, and is not comparable to, say, Tesla&#39;s autopilot.https://asia.nikkei.com/Business/Automobiles/Honda-launches-...&gt; It can free drivers from driving in congested traffic on an expressway when travelling slower than 50 kilometers per hour.&gt; The system automatically accelerates, brakes and steers while monitoring the vehicle&#39;s surroundings, using data from high-definition mapping and external sensors."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"So, clearly Google has too much power over the internet, it&#39;s arbitrary and opaque, etc.  I agree.  However, I think it is worth pointing out that:1) malware is often very aggressive and fast-spreading, and once it&#39;s on a user&#39;s computer it&#39;s hard to get off, therefore...2) the system to detect it and stop access to the site has to be automated, not a human-in-the-loop system that might take hours or days to shut off access to a site which is infecting many users per minute, and...3) the more clarity there is on how exactly that automated system works, the more certain we can be that malware will be able to evade it; it&#39;s much like how spam detection or search page rankings are opaque, because the incentives to game the system are very greatI&#39;m not saying Google&#39;s system is perfect, but I am saying it&#39;s a very hard problem to solve in a way that doesn&#39;t give us an even worse time stopping malware spread than we already have.  So while it is hard to feel sorry for a company as wealthy and powerful as Google, I think the issue is not as clear-cut as some comments on this thread seem to suggest."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt;Now we run automated tests to monitor server uptime and check server for problems every 30 seconds. Unfortunately automated test scripts were happily getting HTTP/200 replies while people using the Chrome browser were being told this is a scam business trying to steal their bank account information.I was surprised this wasn&#39;t part of the lessons learned. But it seems the monitoring basically failed but that wasn&#39;t a lesson.I feel like majority of uptime monitors are falling for this same trap. One of the reasons why for my monitoring service I choose to do full page load monitoring via Chrome instead of just a http request via Curl or whatever. Main reason, people care if the webpage loads or not. People care how long it takes for their webpage to load. Having a website respond in 200ms is great but if it takes 8000ms for all the JS to load and process your website is still slow. I get why sites are just doing curl requests because it&#39;s way cheaper but really you&#39;re monitoring one part of the stack while really caring about all of it. If your website starts producing javascript errors you want to know, etc.[1] https://www.ootliers.com (The landing page and everything are terrible and I&#39;m working on improving that)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"They can remove your YouTube account, app, entire Google account or even your website at any time and you can only make guesses why did that happen, because they always make the rules really vague and it&#39;s never clear what is or is not allowed. And even when they do admit the mistake and get you back up, they still won&#39;t explain anything and nothing is ever fixed. Thank you Google, very cool."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"0data appears to be a curated collection of five best-in-class libraries/frameworks that enable building SPA apps with user controlled data, rather than Big Tech controlled platforms and services.1. Autonomous Data2. remoteStorage3. Solid Project4. Unhosted5.

								<p class="story__comment_others">"As someone dabbling with such an app right now, there are several hurdles if you want to exclusively use self sovereign identity.1. Local data gets lost, so you need to sync for backup. But when your device gets lost or when you need to access it from elsewhere, how would you login to the said backup service? The most intuitive option is still a username and a password.2. It&#39;s hard to transfer data from one device to another. And to asynchronously share data with friends and family. Solutions like ipfs exist, but in practice they rely on many centralized services (eg: for pinning). And besides, securely sharing private data is not an option on any of them.3. Lay people being able to safely handle cryptographic keys is an unrealistic assumption.So IMHO, perfect 0-data is not going to happen. It used to work earlier (pre-internet) because we had only one device, didn&#39;t  have a lot of media, and could carry floppy disks for the rare occasion.What I think would make a difference is: browser apps being able to do TCP/UDP (with safe-guards) and sandboxed local disk-access. This allows web apps to do things like SSH, and login to the vast storage infrastructure that already exists - such as GitHub. Data remains fully under your control and becomes portable. Git IMHO is a better path to where Solid wants to go.  Especially once SHA256 commit hashes land - to become your personal, consensus-less blockchain."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"For the vast majority of users, isn&#39;t having solid export options enough, or even better than this? Your average non-techie isn&#39;t going to want to configure each app to get syncing with NextCloud or Dropbox working just right, they just want to perform a task with the app and move on with their lives, regardless of where the data lives. And with an export option, if the app dies, you&#39;ve still got your blog posts or pictures or drawings or whatever it is you were using the app for.I think being in this bubble of working in and thinking about tech 24/7 can often make us miss the point - these apps are just meant to be tools to do a task."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"If anyone from the dolt team is reading this, I&#39;d like to make an enquiry:At bugout.dev, we have an ongoing crawl of public GitHub. We just created a dataset of code snippets crawled from popular GitHub repositories, listed by language, license, github repo, and commit hash and are looking to release it publicly and keep it up-to-date with our GitHub crawl.The dataset for a single crawl comes in at about 60GB. We uploaded the data to Kaggle because we thought it would be a good place for people to work with the data. Unfortunately, the Kaggle notebook experience is not tailored to such large datasets. Our dataset is in a SQLite database. It takes a long time for the dataset to load into Kaggle notebooks, and I don&#39;t think they are provisioned with SSDs as queries take a long time. Our best workaround to this is to partition into 3 datasets on Kaggle - train, eval, and development, but it will be a pain to manage this for every update, especially as we enrich the dataset with results of static analysis, etc.I&#39;d like to explore hosting the public dataset on Dolthub.

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Wordpress would have benefited from this.What a lot of webmasters want is, test the site locally, then merge it back. A lot of people turned to Jekyll or Hugo for the very reason that it can be checked into git, and git is reliable. A static website can’t get hacked, whereas anyone who has been burnt with Wordpress security fail knows they’d prefer a static site.And even more: People would like to pass the new website from the designer to the customer to managers — Wordpress might have not needed to develop their approval workflows (permission schemes, draft/preview/publish) if they had had a forkable database."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I recently worked for one of the biggest mobile game developers. While I game a lot and have been for over 20 years I never played anything on my phone (PC gaming only) so I was pretty shocked at the state of the industry. They have meetings about making the game more addictive, taking away any chance to get ahead in the game by skill or grind so you must spend, targeting vulnerable groups, making it hard to see how much you actually spent in the game.To have these people paint themselves as oppressed and offended... is exactly what I&#39;ve come to expect after every online social justice controversy I&#39;ve witnessed so far.And I know exactly how they would respond to me: What do you mean by &#34;these people&#34; you *ist!"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"What I believe has happened here is that the well-pointed satire actually offended some people who have made their career doing what the satire criticizes. Thus they have mobilized all sorts of specious attacks to take it down - arguing that it is somehow contributing to sexism or elitism [0], and arguing it makes the documentation more confusing (&#34;oh won&#39;t someone please think of the new developers!&#34;).[0] https://twitter.com/LiaSae/status/1367074344313237507?s=20"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Life is controversial by its very nature. I&#39;m not saying you have to go full teenage edgelord, but we have to learn to accept that everyone has different lives and experiences. These experiences lead to different viewpoints and opinions. I have very different viewpoints than even myself a few years ago. I imagine a completely different person in a different city or country would disagree with at least some of them. And you know what? I am okay with that.I don&#39;t like this fake-wokism SV monoculture creeping into everything. I wouldn&#39;t mind them sharing their opinions on things if they didn&#39;t have teeth. Somehow the professionally oppressed are backed by nearly every major corporation on the planet. It makes me overreact. I don&#39;t like it. Most people don&#39;t like it.

Something like 10% of all CO, 5% of VOCs come from gas-powered lawn equipment, and they produce &gt;30%* of the non-car pollutants.Traditional American lawn maintenance is a horribly unsustainable (and in my opinion, ugly) practice. We should encourage alternatives.See: Banks, &#34;National Emissions from Lawn and Garden Equipment&#34;"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Has anyone else noticed the trend of ever-increasing laws and ever-decreasing enforcement?It’s not a good mix.  We end up with a system that punishes people following the rules and doesn’t do anything about the many people breaking the rules.  It also creates the sense of unfairness and general lawlessness — that laws are recommendations that can mostly be ignored."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Used to live across the street from a neighbor who got his yard cleaned up by a crew with a gas blower twice weekly.  They were already banned in that town, but it was never enforced.  The noise would wake me up and the fumes—like standing next to a 1960s Mustang with a cold engine—would drift into our apartment and linger for 15-20 minutes.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Rackauckas has done a lot of work to create the whole scientific machine learning (SciML) ecosystem (with collaborators).Symbolics.jl is the new step to a universal CAS tool in Julia to bridge the gap between symbolic manipulation and numerical computationIt is especially useful as a foundation for equation-based simulation package ModelingToolkit.jl. In the foreseeable future, I expect ModelingToolkit.jl can be comparable with the Modelica ecosystem to provide fast, accurate modeling and simulation capability and easy integration with machine learning methods for Julia ecosystem, which is crucial for engineering application and scientific research."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is very cool. Computer Algebra Systems are like a super power. I’ve been able to use the TI-89’s arbitrary precision to do pretty sophisticated cryptography work. Symbolics.jl has the ability to modify some of the rules of the algebra, which should allow even easier implementation of number theory related cryptographic concepts (as well as compression and error correcting codes... or quaternions or bra-ket quantum mechanics) without needing specific libraries. I love this as I’m trying to teach myself the fundamental concepts in mathematical terms and not just something in a specialized black box library. (And without paying the insanely high price of Mathematica if I ever want to use it professionally.)I’ve looked briefly into Julia in the past, but if stuff like this becomes pretty standard (in the way numpy is for Python), I think I could become pretty comfortable in Julia."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"CASes are one of the most difficult things to write and they’re never complete. There are always bugs, performance concerns, anemic mathematical domains, etc. Every major free or commercial CAS that’s still in use is under active development to battle these inadequacies. Dozens of CASes have come and gone in the past 30 years, the majority of which have bitrotted or stopped being maintained. And not a single CAS has reigned supreme as the CAS that beats all CASes.It’s very exciting to see more work in CASes being done, but I worry that “starting a CAS from scratch” isn’t the right approach. The Axiom [0, 1] project rightly identified that building a general-purpose CAS for working practitioners of computational mathematics is an effort requiring nearly generational timespans [2], and that you must have the right language to describe mathematical objects and their relationships. They had a literate programming policy, where all math code must be accompanied by publication-quality documentation, precisely because it’s so hard to build and maintain these systems. Some of the greatest computational discoveries and expositions came out of the development of Axiom, like the richest and most complete implementation of the renowned Risch algorithm for doing symbolic integrals.Axiom fell into disuse for a variety of reasons, but from my perspective, found new life in a fork called FriCAS [3, 4], which is actively developed and allows a more “software engineer friendly” approach to the development of the system. The code they have is enormously complex and has mountains of knowledge from foremost experts in computer algebra.I really wish new computer algebra initiatives attempted in earnest to make use of and extend Axiom/FriCAS so that we could continue to build up our knowledge of this exceedingly delicate and tricky subject without constantly starting from zero. Axiom has a manual that is over 1,000 pages of dense mathematics and that’s really hard to rebuild correctly.(The only project I know who honestly tried to build upon and subsequently extend CAS functionality is Sage [5], which builds upon a plethora of existing open source general-purpose and specialized computational math systems.)[0] https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axiom_(computer_algebra_syst...[1] http://www.axiom-developer.org/[2] Quote from Axiom manual (http://fricas.sourceforge.net/doc/book.pdf):&gt; With that in mind I’ve introduced the theme of the “30 year horizon”. We must invent the tools that support the Computational Mathematician working 30 years from now. How will research be done when every bit of mathematical knowledge is online and instantly available? What happens when we scale Axiom by a factor of 100, giving us 1.1 million domains? How can we integrate theory with code? How will we integrate theorems and proofs of the mathematics with space-time complexity proofs and running code? What visualization tools are needed? How do we support the conceptual structures and semantics of mathematics in effective ways? How do we support results from the sciences? How do we teach the next generation to be effective Computational Mathematicians? The “30 year horizon” is much nearer than it appears.[3] https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/FriCAS[4] http://fricas.sourceforge.net/[5] https://www.sagemath.org/"</p>

My initial thought was that this should be something that runs in the background and grows very slowly, and then you could check it from time to time by running `cbonsai` from the console, or have it show on your desktop or screen saver.  You know, kind of like a real plant, but it grows slightly faster and you have no maintenance."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I LOVE Proton. About 85% of my Windows games just... work. And probably 75% of the 15% that fail initially only require a little tweaking to make work.My only complaints are that steam uses arbitrary numbers instead of human readable labels for emulated AppData folders. It can be time consuming to locate a save game file. Also Streaming cross platform isn&#39;t a pleasant experience yet but it&#39;s getting better and I really appreciate the feature. My final gripe is that when adding media to a Steam chat on Linux the file open dialog does not cache the last folder you visited and doesn&#39;t support multiple files. This compounds the first problem I listed making it EXTREMELY time consuming to share multiple game files with friends quickly."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Proton is the reason I moved from a Windows + MacOS machine to GNU/Linux full time. I understand the concern that some hardcore enthusiasts might have about it making devs lazy when it comes to developing native ports but to be honest I don&#39;t care. I am just glad to have a simple method of gaming on GNU/Linux. Proton plus Lutris and the slew other tools that have come out in recent years has made the transition to GNU/Linux very easy and has opened the door for many who were curious but scared of the learning curb."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Proton is neat for sure, but unfortunately modern anti-cheat solutions expect Windows and will not allow Linux clients to connect. There&#39;s also a few games that I expected to work but simply won&#39;t launch for me, like Elder Scrolls Online.I&#39;m a fan of the Linux desktop, but for me the easiest solution is to have a dedicated Linux PC (right now an XPS 13 Developer) and a Windows machine for playing video games. I don&#39;t have the patience to troubleshoot getting games to run or perform well anymore."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I have deep aversion to &#34;Open source projects should run office hours&#34; title.Maybe &#34;Office hours may be a good idea for open source projects&#34;? This would not suggest obligation.In general, fact that someone created or maintains or supports open source projects should not be considered to create any obligations beyond lack of malice and abuse.I am not obligated to support any bugs, create any features and it is perfectly fine to delete all my repos at any time (unless I declared otherwise).I am also not obligated to support anything, help with anything, there is no guarantee of uptime, office hours, resolving issues or anything else.If you want obligations, guarantees or anything like that - feel free to hire a given developer.Many such things are good ideas and some people may decide to promise them (if you describe something as secure then you declared to handle security issues timely). But I reject idea of being obligated to do any of above."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I think a lot of the comments are concluding from the title that open source maintainers should be working on the projects during office hours.That is not what the article is suggesting.From the article -&gt;&gt;  anyone can book a 25 minute conversation with me on a Friday to talk about the project. I’m interested in talking to people who are using Datasette, or who are considering using it, or who just want to have a chat.&gt;&gt;A challenge of open source is that it’s easy to be starved of feedback. People might file bug reports if something breaks, but other than that it can feel like publishing software into a void.&gt;&gt; Hearing directly from people who are using your stuff is incredibly motivational. It’s also an amazing source of ideas and feedback on where the project should go next.I think that&#39;s really a fantastic suggestion."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;ve had massive success with this in ML. My twitter DMs have become almost-daily office hour sessions with people trying to solve hard ML problems. The last fellow was so happy he venmo&#39;d me $250 after I merely asked for &#34;pay whatever you thought that was worth.&#34;Apparently putting &#34;DMs open&#34; in your twitter bio is an excellent way to meet new people. Also, tweet (often!) about what you&#39;re working on. Post lots of questions, notes to self, and screenshots or videos.To get followers, you&#39;ll need to go inject yourself into conversations. That seems to be the most reliable way to get noticed.We also run an ML discord server and do informal office hours for people working on various ML products. It may sound cheesy, but I try to emulate what pg would do in a YC office hours session. It seems to keep them pretty focused.So, yes! Glad to see office hours are becoming mainstream. Try it out; you&#39;ll probably be surprised."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"We&#39;ve got some information on the timeline (and a name) on one of the major exploits here:https://proxylogon.com/Some of the detail on where this is a mess -The relevant security update is only offered for the latest (-1) Cumulative Update for Exchange. So you can open Windows Update and it will say &#34;fully updated and secured&#34;, but you&#39;re not. Complicating matters, Cumulative Updates for Exchange 2019 have to be done from the licensing portal, with a valid logon.So maybe you have a perfectly capable 24x7 tech team, but the guy who manages license acquisition is on leave today. This is how you may basically find yourself resorting to piracy to get this patched."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"We are seriously looking at strategies for clean room rebuild of our IT infrastructure, potentially on a recurring basis via automation.Obviously, you cant mitigate 0-day exploits in any situation where reasonable/expected network access is possible. But our concern, despite not being directly impacted by this, is that we may have accumulated malware over the past decade+ that has never been discovered. How many exploits exist in the wild which have never been documented or even noticed? Do we think it&#39;s at least one?The thinking we are getting into is - If we nuke-from-orbit and then reseed from trusted backups on a recurring basis, any malware that gets installed via some side-channel would not be able to persist for as long as it traditionally would. Keeping backups pure via deterministic cryptographic schemes is far easier to work with than running 100+ security suites across your IT stack in hopes you find something naughty. It is incredibly hard for malware to hide in a well-normalized SQL database without SP or other programmatic features.What if we built a new IT stack that was designed to be obliterated and reconstructed every 24 hours with latest patch builds each time? Surely many businesses could tolerate 1-2 hours of downtime overnight. It certainly works for the stock market. There really isn&#39;t a reason you need to give an attacker a well-managed private island to hide on for 10+ years at a time."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Bigger picture, what&#39;s the endgame here?  It seems a lot of institutions handling sensitive work are considering air-gapping some or all of their networks at this point.  Maybe that&#39;s even what has to happen.Is there a means of fending off these attacks on the political front?  If this same level of espionage was happening in person, there would be a kinetic response but it seems everyone is happy to just turn the other cheek.These attacks have a very real impact.  Copying others homework is a tried and true way to get a technological edge and in practical terms, it means a lot of research and development money is effectively wasted as it doesn&#39;t generate any returns.Mind, I don&#39;t think there should be a violent response, but it&#39;s odd that even the threat of sanctions isn&#39;t made whenever this happens."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The competitive advantages of owning both the application and the data are so high that don&#39;t see widespread BYOC ever happening without government intervention.I&#39;d like to see an enforced separation in law between commercial application providers and storage providers. So, if someone writes an app like Google Docs, they can&#39;t just store the data opaquely on their own cloud servers. They legally have to integrate with a separate storage provider. And that storage provider has an obligation to make my data accessible and manageable by me.This wouldn&#39;t be a panacea, but it at least makes it theoretically possible to write a replacement client for Google Docs that could be a drop-in replacement."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This idea suffers from the same problem federation does. It&#39;s harder to move a whole ecosystem. Makes it harder to innovate. Leads to centralized platforms outperforming these BYOC/federated/open options.

They were already gifted many billions of dollars in the past for this same basic purpose but they pocketed the money.  They can just use the free money they&#39;ve already been given.  Instead, the funding should go to existing munipical fiber ISPs to expand their coverage.  Give money to people with a proven track record of doing what you want, not people with a proven track record of keeping the money for themselves.I&#39;m on municipal fiber and it&#39;s amazing."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Imagine how good our network technology policy would be if the Senate weren&#39;t run by septagenarians and octogenarian.I fear that data caps for home internet will become standard. There is no technological reason for these caps. For wireless, they could be defended by arguing that companies only get to use so much spectrum because of FCC laws. But the only limit for home internet is the ISP&#39;s willingness to deploy equipment and install cable/fiber runs. That&#39;s exactly what customers are paying them to do."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Lets try and suss out some of the multiple issues with US internet:-regulating ISPs as a free market is, to be hyperbolic, a disaster. there is effectively a monopoly in most parts of the country.-25/3 Mbps is a very reasonable speed for most people. the issue is that its provided on a best effort basis that is never maintained for long, if at all. netflix says thats enough to stream UHD[0]-FTA: &#34;Those data points likely undercount the number of unserved Americans because the FCC lets ISPs count an entire census block as served even if it can serve just one home in the block&#34; hilarious - what else is there to say.-FTA: &#34;The senators are also frustrated by differing standards across agencies. [...] the FCC defines [...] Alternatively, the US Department of Agriculture (USDA) defines&#34; why is this the federal government&#39;s job again? the internet is clearly not an enumerated power. is this the interstate commerce clause that keeps on giving in action again? i think decentralizing federal power would help alleviate a lot of the existential dread vis a vi corruption that many americans are feeling.all in all, this reeks of regulatory capture to me. if we&#39;re gonna have a serious discussion about internet infrastructure, i think the starting point is how we classify ISPs and where in the city-state-federal hierarchy the responsibility lies. changing a 25 to a 100 is a cool bullet on a resume, but i dont think this is the low handing fruit here.[0]https://help.netflix.com/en/node/306"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I just don&#39;t get it why developers like Scrum.
The whole thing was designed to give non-technical people more power over the ones who spent a lifetime honing their craftmanship. Standing around a table in the morning like assholes is not my idea of fun. Same for the &#34;product owner&#34; concept. If I develop something, I am the owner. I generally hate being micromanaged and being assigned microtasks that gives &#34;them&#34; total control over my workday while I have no idea what &#34;they&#34; are doing the whole day. 
Scrum was the reason why I left my last company and I&#39;m much happier now in my new company, where we do not have any process at all, just a common goal. Instead of standups, the team gathers for a coffee in the morning. If I want to spend 3 days learning a new framework that might do the product good, nobody cares. The only thing that counts is the endresult. That means we are beating the product into submission until its good, even if it means rewriting the thing three times and missing deadlines.
So no more Scrum for me. Never."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I think you need to separate Agile from Scrum to be honest.Agile is at is core just some suggestions for teams to work well together. There are no stand ups or sprints or whatever.Scrum was created by one of the creators of the agile manifesto as a way to see consulting/training around the &#39;Agile&#39; idea (timeframes may differ a bit, but they were linked). There is an interview/article by one of the creators of the agile manifesto (Kent Beck maybe?, will try to dig it up and edit the answer if I find -&gt; was Robert C. Martin, see below) where he explains a bit the story and compares it to Agile (and basically says scrum has nothing to do with the original agile manifesto)On a personal level, I hate scrum. The stand ups, the sprints, the retros or grooming or whatever they have nowadays. It is literally one of the first questions I ask in an interview about their processes and excuse myself from the process if I see if they follow it. It may work for others, but for me personally, I hate it with a fervour.Though I agree with the Agile manifesto though, unfortunately it isn&#39;t very &#39;manager&#39; friendly so you usually get scrum instead.Edit: link to a reference to the article, can&#39;t find the original but found this: https://www.aaron-gray.com/a-criticism-of-scrum/#scrum-strai..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;ve never felt like a stand-up with your manager-type-person present is ever net helpful. Stand-ups just implicitly become &#34;what did you do yesterday that justified 10% of your biweekly paycheck&#34; at some level, and people end up talking to the manager rather than to each other.I&#39;m sure some super special orgs out there can counteract this with their incredible non-toxic culture and such. Most cannot. Ones that explicitly think they can almost certainly actually cannot.If it&#39;s solely the IC&#39;s, I think that&#39;s where it can be good. People feel a lot more free to not say anything if they don&#39;t have any blockers and don&#39;t need to put anything to the team. It&#39;s much easier to get in-and-out and have a high-bandwidth discussion.I&#39;ve felt the most comfortable where we sat down once a week for an hour, went over the last week, and thought about the next. And we had an open-door policy (not literally/physically of course) if you ever needed to discuss blockers or put things to the team. &#34;Standups&#34; happened naturally, about once or twice as week, where people would accrete into a standup in the middle of our pod discussing something that was so interesting/relevant that it naturally drew us out of our offices.Maybe that was just the only time where we finally had the team and the process mesh on a natural level, and it doesn&#39;t prescribe this as &#34;the way to do it&#34; for anyone else. But damn did it work for us, for at least two years, before the org changed enough that our team didn&#39;t really exist as the same team anymore.One thing I have never enjoyed was the &#34;the big boss wants this project done ASAP, have standups every day to make sure it gets done as fast as possible&#34;. That and everything related to it was awful."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Up until not long ago, Google search result pages worked well without JS, and if you sent a suitably old UA header, you&#39;d get the &#34;original&#34; version without mangled URLs or any of the other bloat. Then in 2019 or so, in what I consider to be an extremely hostile move, they started redirecting (using meta tags) to a horrible dumbed-down mobile-ish version and using styles-removed-by-JS to &#34;hide&#34; the actual content of the &#34;full&#34; version (which has the &#34;modern&#34; mangled URLs) if you managed to reach it anyway, so all you&#39;d see was a blank page. It&#39;s almost like they were deliberately trying to make something that only worked in the latest version of Chrome or whatever few other &#34;modern&#34; browsers exist today, and decided to force non-JS users to a worse experience than they had had for the past decade or more. Nothing a filtering proxy can&#39;t fix (and I brought back true URLs at the same time), but I was absolutely incensed when that happened.I don&#39;t think a search engine should ever require JS to be usable. The existence of search engines[1] predates the existence of JS, and of course the HTML mechanism of form submission and displaying a list of links predates both of those.[1] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JumpStation"</p>

At first glance, this seems like probably the best Electron alternative I&#39;ve seen posted on HN.Apart from the consistent GUI layer, I think an underrated reason that many teams stick with Electron is the mature tooling for cross-platform builds and upgrades.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Some problems that Fukushima had: 1950s vintage design, active cooling system, backup power at sea level in a seismically active area.  This kind of failure was not just predictable, it was predicted.People travel to Japan from around the world to learn how to build earthquake resistant structures.  Their nuclear engineers are top-notch.  It was the bureaucracy that failed, not the talent.In short, the problems were human not technical.  People get complacent and greedy.  They use every procedural tool they have to delay upgrades, maintenance, and improvement.  I think that is at the core of most nuclear skepticism.  Does anyone honestly think the United States has institutions sound enough to safely manage nuclear power over multiple decades?  Or will they neglect basic maintenance and upgrades?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The key thing to remember is that power sources like coal and other fossil fuels have a very real health cost. A large number of people die every year. However a nuclear accident is much more &#34;exciting&#34; news and sticks in people&#39;s mind. People dying of cancer, asthma and other conditions are not as direct or as dramatic."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The real trouble with the light water reactor is not the nuclear part but the steam turbine it is attached to.Unfortunately people have a way of driving while looking in the rear view mirror and much of the discussion around nuclear energy revolves around issues of the 1970s.In the 1970s coal burning power plants were the cost king of power plants.  There was some concern about making them cleaner,  but by the 1980s gas turbine power plants with 10 times the power density (e.g. 1/10 the capital cost)  were becoming widespread and people quit building coal plants.(A big literature got left behind about how to drive a gas turbine from coal,  on paper it would be lower capital cost than a conventional coal plant,  but the technology never got developed at full scale.)Even if the heat was free it would be hard for a steam turbine based power plant to compete with gas turbines.Now it should be possible to build a nuclear power plant based on the brayton cycle using helium or carbon dioxide or some similar gas as a working fluid.  You then need to use helium or sodium or lead as a coolant because the pressure would be too high with water.Fast reactors are the best developed option,  followed by the prismatic HTGR,  then the thorium reactors.  Pebble-bed HTGR looked pretty good until an expose came out that a German pebble bed reactor had a difficult time...  Turns out pebbles that slide past each other just fine in air will get stuck on each other and crack in helium.When Bill Gates and others go around saying we have to get over the safety issue they are continuing the stigma.  Nuclear power is not going to get out of it&#39;s funk unless it has a cost story that looks good when everything goes right -- which is not the case with the LWR."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I&#39;d add to this list:Chunk extensions. Most people know HTTP/1.1 can return a &#34;chunked&#34; response body: it breaks the body up into chunks, so that we can send a response whose length we don&#39;t know in advance, but also it allows us to keep the connection open after we&#39;re done. What most people don&#39;t know is that chunks can carry key-value metadata. The spec technically requires an implementation to at least parse them, though I think it is permitted to ignore them. I&#39;ve never seen anything ever use this, and I hope that never changes. They&#39;re gone in HTTP/2. (So, also, if you thought HTTP/2 was backwards compatible: not technically!)The &#34;Authorization&#34; header: like &#34;Referer&#34;, this header is misspelled. (It should be spelled, &#34;Authentication&#34;.) Same applies to &#34;401 Unauthorized&#34;, which really ought to be &#34;401 Unauthenticated&#34;. (&#34;Unauthorized&#34; is &#34;403 Forbidden&#34;, or sometimes &#34;404 Not Found&#34;.)Also, header values. They&#39;re basically require implementing a custom string type to handle correctly; they&#39;re a baroque mix of characters &amp; &#34;opaque octets&#34;."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;ve been searching for a while for a good way to know whether a client has disconnected in the middle of a long-running HTTP request. (We do heavyweight SQL queries of indeterminate length in response to those requests, and we&#39;d like to be able to cancel them, rather than wasting DB-server CPU cycles calculating reports nobody&#39;s going to consume.)You can&#39;t actually know whether the outgoing side of a TCP socket is closed, unless you write something to it. But it&#39;s hard to come up with something to write to an HTTP/1.1-over-TCP socket before you respond with anything, that would be a valid NOP according to all the protocol layers in play. (TCP keepalives would be perfect for this... if routers didn&#39;t silently drop them.)But I guess sending an HTTP 102 every second or two could be used for exactly this: prodding the socket with something that middleboxes will be sure to pass back to the client.If so, that&#39;s awesome! ...and also something I wish could be handled for me automatically by web frameworks, because getting that working sounds kind of ridiculous :)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Another thing to note about custom headers is that when used in an XHR (eg: X-Requested-With), they will force a preflight request (with the OPTIONS method). If your webserver isn&#39;t configured to handle OPTIONS and return the correct CORS headers, that will effectively break clients.Best to just never use custom headers.I&#39;ve written more about this here: https://developer.akamai.com/blog/2015/08/17/solving-options..."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"To respond to some of the comments.It is not that there is anything intrinsically wrong with these functions. You can technically use all of them and I have been using all of them, safely, for decades.The issue is they are huge traps to the point that in a larger piece of software one can say &#34;well, it&#39;s just not worth it&#34;.You can go much, much, much further than that.In couple embedded projects I worked some of the rules were:* dynamic allocation after application has started is banned -- any heap buffers and data structures must be allocated at the start of the application and after that any allocation is a compile time error,* any constructs that would prevent statically calculating stack usage were banned (for example any form of recursion except when exact recursion depth is ensured statically),* any locks were banned,* absolutely every data structure must have size ensured, in a simple way, beyond any reasonable doubt,etc."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"It would be nice if the error messages generated would suggest replacement functions that they deem appropriate.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Here&#39;s an anecdote about what happens when you design a product in the opposite way.I own https://www.executeprogram.com, which has interactive in-browser courses on various software development technologies. Currently they all cover languages, more or less: TypeScript, SQL, various JS topics, regexes. (Disclosure: it costs money after you finish your 16th lesson.)Almost all (maybe literally all) of our competitors are amenable to binging. It&#39;s true of books, video learning platforms, and most/all other interactive learning platforms.Execute Program is very intentionally non-bingeable. When you start a course, you get 5 lessons on the first day, then it stops you and tells you to come back tomorrow. On the next day, you get some brief reviews of yesterday&#39;s lessons, then a few new lessons, then it stops you again until the next day. That cadence repeats until you finish the course. You can&#39;t binge/cram even if you want to.(A bit more technical detail: it&#39;s a spaced repetition system with exponential review intervals, similar to those used for language learning in e.g. WaniKani and Anki. But it also has a lot of fine-grained knowledge of its own course structure, so it can use reviews to intelligently unlock different lessons depending on how the user performed on their reviews.)Occasionally, we get support email from new users who don&#39;t like this. They want to cram a whole course in a day. But cramming is a very time-inefficient way to learn, so this is self-defeating! Since launch, we&#39;ve had good success adjusting the app&#39;s behavior and internal explanations to reduce these complaints.However, we still get emails from long-term users who appreciate the time limitations. Generally these fall into two categories:1. Users like that an enforced break before the reviews provides tangible evidence that &#34;yes, I genuinely understood yesterday&#39;s lessons&#34;. If we allowed cramming, that reassurance wouldn&#39;t exist; it&#39;s too easy to succeed at a review when you just finished the lesson 30 seconds ago.2. Users like that the usage limits remove a source of anxiety and worry. You do your reviews and lessons, you finish, and then you wait until tomorrow. There&#39;s no temptation to think &#34;I really should&#39;ve done 10 lessons today instead of 5; I&#39;m so lazy&#34;.It&#39;s still possible for a very dedicated user to do all of our courses in parallel within their first monthly billing cycle. (Median course start-to-finish time is 8-18 days depending on the course.) So this scheme doesn&#39;t make users pay us more than they would otherwise. And they&#39;re spending the same amount of wall-clock time that they&#39;d spend if they crammed all of the lessons in one day. That makes it pure win: they memorize the topics more deeply, they worry less, and they get those benefits for no extra time expenditure. The only exception I can think of would be people who think &#34;I must get exposure to all TypeScript syntax and semantics before tomorrow morning, even if that significantly reduces my ability to remember what I learned.&#34;Obviously I&#39;m very biased here, and the goals that we&#39;re optimizing for don&#39;t even exist in most other product spaces. But I thought it would be nice to have a counterexample to &#34;engagement at all costs&#34;."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I don&#39;t like the current trend of social media apps burying users under push notifications, calls to action, and other engagement hooks.However, there&#39;s a second, parallel problem adding fuel to the fire: The more we talk about overindulgence in social media (or Netflix, or video games, or fast food) as an act perpetrated by evil corporations on us helpless individuals, the less sense of individual agency we give ourselves. I&#39;m not suggesting that we let social media companies off the hook, but battling this problem is going to require more than simply shaming them in Medium posts. We have to start reminding people that they are in control of their decisions, and that they can take steps to reduce their social media usage to healthy levels.I know the common refrain is &#34;Delete Facebook!&#34; but that&#39;s the equivalent of abstinence-only education. We need to start talking about how to configure Screen Time on iOS, or how to use Facebook&#39;s built-in tools to hide content you don&#39;t want to see. We also need to encourage people to take control of their feeds, muting users and topics who draw them into unproductive discussions."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"A tangential point about the horrifying power of euphemism: I&#39;ve done some consulting work with some large biopharmaceutical companies in the past and found myself consistently shocked at how effective euphemism was at making people comfortable talking about, and doing, very questionable things. E.g. &#34;Maximizing treatment&#34; = &#34;extend how long a patient requires our medication&#34;. This was at a senior level and these were, on the face of it, warm, caring people having a very comfortable and open conversation. I had always assumed decisions that directly disadvantaged the consumer would look different, with some sense of secrecy or at least awareness. Nope, one level of language abstraction is apparently all it takes.There are countless other examples out there. I just finished &#34;Cruel Britannia&#34; regarding the torture practices of the British over the last century. They were particularly adept at it. Euphemism is such a powerful tool for doublethink and systemic abuses of power."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Please do. Had to go up to full gigabit down with xfinity to get 35 up. Next highest was 15 I think? Not that you can figure that out easily - their website doesn&#39;t list upload speeds. Or maybe it does - the website is terrible to navigate, slow and I got 404s off their main internet landing page.Anyhow at the risk of this turning into a multi page rant about comcast I&#39;ll cut back to upload speed. I see it as upload is for creation and download is for consumption. What do the cable companies want people to be doing?If you look at the popularity of twitch/youtube/(things I&#39;m too old and unhip to know about) it is a direct threat to cable/traditional content creation. I&#39;d wager the current state of affairs holds a lot of people back from getting into content creation, especially poorer/larger families who have to share a limited connection."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"My local broadband provider admitted to me that they could offer symmetric 1 gig service, but are choosing not to.  The current max a residential customer can purchase is 1 gig down, 25Mbs up.  The monthly non-discount rate is $180, with $110/month possible with certain promotions.  It is an extra 10$/month to go from 20Mbs up to 25Mbs.  Starlink is doing well here."</p>

Myself and all my friends are sitting on around 100 Mbps up/down uncapped unshaped, no fair use policy each at around $100 USD monthly. A few of my friends are on Gigabit down, 200 up.How is America behind on this? Everything is hosted there and cached there. Is it big business lobbying politicians to prevent them from having to compete? In South Africa we have dozens on ISPs and as an economy we&#39;re probably not far off from one US state. The competition has been great for consumers."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"One of my pet meta-theories about Hacker News is that the frustration expressed over several apparently different stories really has a single source: Hacker News likes the internet of 10-20 years ago a lot more than the average person.One place this shows up is a frequently-expressed sentiment that the internet is a less magical, less weird, and more corporate place than it was 10-20 years ago. Part of this may be because SEO has diluted the voices of individual creators. But part of it is also because way more average, everyday, tech-unsavvy people are on the internet now.Another example is the periodic highlighting of somewhat garish HTML-based websites. I like these too! My own personal website falls in this category! But as far as I know, the generic internet user likes the generic slick-graphics-and-whitespace style, and so go the websites that want to attract them.More relevant to the topic at hand, many comments in this thread argue that targeted ads are unnecessary for a functional internet, since the internet of 20 years ago seemed to work just fine without targeted ads. But, again, it&#39;s less clear to me that general internet users -- that is, mostly people who never experienced the internet of 20 years ago -- have the same preference.It&#39;s funny, because I&#39;m to a large extent on HN&#39;s side on this one. But my enthusiasm is tempered by my sneaking suspicion that the other side is a lot bigger, and my side is actually powered by more elitism and nostalgia than I thought."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This captures my feelings on the issue:&gt; That framing is based on a false premise that we have to choose between “old tracking” and “new tracking.” It’s not either-or. Instead of re-inventing the tracking wheel, we should imagine a better world without the myriad problems of targeted ads.I don&#39;t want to be tracked. I never have wanted to be tracked. I shouldn&#39;t have to aggressively opt-out of tracking; it should be a service one must opt-in to receive. And it&#39;s not something we can trust industry to correct properly. This is precisely the role that privacy-protecting legislation should be undertaking.Stop spying on us, please."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is exactly why we&#39;re building EthicalAds. It&#39;s an ad network that only targets based on the content of sites, doesn&#39;t allow any third-party media, and is currently only focused on a developer audience: https://www.ethicalads.io/advertising-vision/We had the same choice on Read the Docs, but didn&#39;t really have any other way to make money but advertising. We decided to build ethical advertising, so that we could be proud of the ads we show, knowing we weren&#39;t adding to massive pool of data out there.

								<p class="story__comment_others">"As dis-heartening as this story is, compared to a couple of years ago, it is encouraging to see lots of comments from people beginning to wake up to what is going on with this craziness and not being modded here.Free speech is about protecting the right of the un-popular and views that some may find utterly repugnant. Why? because, as we are seeing with all of the woke craziness, when you don&#39;t stand up for everyones ability (including views you do not like) to freely speak, the censorship will end up being turned against you.The key things with all of this, is that if enough people were to collectively have the courage to push back against this craziness it would stop...people recognizing that there is a problem is a good first step."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I don&#39;t know any culture that banned books independent of their content that people didn&#39;t regret in the future.A few months ago I was reading about schools banning the book &#34;To Kill a Mockingbird&#34; because it contains basically the &#34;n&#34; word. I&#39;m not american, and and havent read that book. I watched the movie, through, and it seemed to me to be a very anti racism message.I think instead of banning, schools should work provide  context to kids and teens that read this books, of how society was when they where written, so people don&#39;t forget the past, but are able to make better decisions to the future."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I can&#39;t be certain, but I suspect the real problem was that the original contract was signed without requiring the technical data rights and/or delivery of the technical data. This is a common mistake made by the DoD, and can lead to extraordinarily high costs later.Just look at the notice: &#34;The deliverables will include all technical data related to the heat exchanger disassembly, all technical data related to the cores, all technical data related to the stack up, vacuum brazing, and installation of the cores on existing units. The deliverables will also include all technical data related to the tooling needed...&#34; It&#39;s clear they don&#39;t have the technical data.Here&#39;s how this can happen: the government asks for proposals, and the prospective contractors say &#34;we&#39;ll create it for you for cheaper if you don&#39;t require the technical data &amp; its related rights&#34;. The government program manager (PM) is under a lot of pressure to &#34;get it cheaper&#34;, and this is cheaper in the short term, so the government PM agrees. The PM will be around for a few years, then leave. Later on, the contractor is the only one who can make the parts (because they&#39;re the only ones with the technical data &amp; the technical data rights to do it). The government procurement system is all about competition, but now there is no possibility for real competition. Thus, the parts will cost 10x or more, and the government PM who approved this is long gone (probably with a promotion), and the contractor is happy with incredibly large profit margins.I don&#39;t know if that&#39;s what happened in this case. But it&#39;s very very possible."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Reverse engineering seems like a good skillset for the DoD to nurture, anyway. Yes, the US is going to be at the cutting edge of weapons design at least through the medium term, but the leadership isn&#39;t arrogant enough to think that all engineering innovations will come domestically. If the US acquired a next-generation Chinese fighter, wouldn&#39;t it be handy if someone had the expertise to tell you exactly how its parts were made and machine replicas if needed?So, the tinfoil hat interpretation of this story would be, of course the Pentagon has the original blueprints in quintuplicate, but it&#39;s identified reverse engineering as a key strategic advantage China has over the US (pretty reasonable so far, right?) and has announced this as a way to shuffle some money into building up domestic RE expertise in the defence industry."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The US nuclear weapons program had to do something similar in the 2000&#39;s with a material known as Fogbank. This is used in the W76 warhead as an interstage material, and they needed more of it to keep the weapons in operational state.Unfortunately, they&#39;d forgotten the manufacturing process, decommissioned the plant that made it, and the people that knew how to do it weren&#39;t around any more. They figured it out, but it doesn&#39;t necessarily look easy to do (nor does the material seem easy at all to make in the first place).https://www.armscontrolwonk.com/archive/201814/fogbank/p20 here says more: https://www.lanl.gov/science/weapons_journal/wj_pubs/17nwj2_...Edit: I somehow missed this other thread in this story, despite a search: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=26334367"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Your whole blog resonates deeply with me. All this corporate grifting and women&#39;s empowerment months will do jack shit until we figure out how to make workplaces and lives more equitable for mothers and allowing for gaps, breaks and destigmatizing time off for parents of both genders.Instead, we talk about how sexism is the biggest problem. Sure, sexism might be annoying, but in the west, it is hardly something that creates a genuine barrier for women.Startups have it worst, and everday I count the number of years I have to work in the high stress places I want or do a startup if I want to have two kids before 35. No one talks about planning around fertility. When I mention it to someone that I want to take time off for a couple years to have children in silicon valley, they look at me as if I&#39;m an alien. As if wanting to be pregnant and not working at the same time as being sleep deprived and wanting to spend time with my own baby when they are at their youngest is some strange outlandish fantasy.All careers are built this way. PhD to tenure, startups, generally high stress professions. I wish the world wasn&#39;t so male centric, that feminists actually cared about finding structural solutions instead of forcing women to become copies of men to achieve gender parity. But they care more about power than actual equality where we acknowledge that women have different needs and desires, that those needs and desires are equally valuable and not inferior to desires men have, that the two genders have different strengths and capabilities and it is equally important to reward both. And maybe not wanting to outsource your baby to a nanny during their most vulnerable years is not a heretical thought.I wish we had more focus in allowing people to transition back from taking a few years off to raise young kids, and it wasn&#39;t automatically assumed that you would be a worse founder or professor or software engineer just because you have 2-4 years you didn&#39;t commercially work. Hell, I want to take that time to contribute to open source, something I don&#39;t get to do much usually and I&#39;m looking forward to it because I am willing to face the  consequences. But I wish more women could be less scared of their career prospects for choosing to have children."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I agree completely with the premise that most people don&#39;t appreciate just how fleeting fertility can be, but I think rather than freezing eggs, the solution is for people to normalize having children at a younger age and designing work and home life around children existing and even being present in certain work contexts.Obviously freezing your eggs is something that you can do as individual without society&#39;s input, and my preferred solution is a cultural overhaul...But economic productivity is only useful insofar as it leads to better lives for people, economic activity that increases well-being by one unit is pointless if it requires us to spend more than one unit of well-being (by say, freezing our eggs and not becoming grandparents until we&#39;re 80) to achieve it."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;m not so sure freezing eggs is sound advice.Lord Winston, who is professor of fertility studies at Imperial College London, warned that it was &#34;a very unsuccessful technology&#34; and said: &#34;The number of eggs that actually result in a pregnancy after freezing is about 1%.&#34; He later clarified he was referring to live births.https://www.bbc.com/news/health-51463488#:~:text=Lord%20Wins....“It’s not like I would discourage egg freezing. Women should be doing it because it’s the best option they have, but it is not an insurance policy,” says Christos Coutifaris, past president of the ASRM and a professor of obstetrics and gynecology at the University of Pennsylvania. “Insurance policies usually guarantee a payoff. In this case, there is no guarantee.”

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&#34;The service will, eventually, be available as a paid option...&#34;How my viewpoint has shifted over the years. 10-20 years ago this would have instantly turned me off, but now this is the most exciting line in the entire thing to me. As long as we all expect free, we can&#39;t expect privacy.@Brave team, who I rather expect will be reading this, I can&#39;t believe that Cliqz doing tracking on me to improve its results for free will be in my interests if it&#39;s free. But if I&#39;m a paying customer, you might be able to convince me that you&#39;re doing some semi-invasive tracking but not actually selling it to anyone, because it wouldn&#39;t be worth losing me as a customer.I&#39;m actually excited about the idea of a search engine that I pay for. Been waiting for DDG to do it but last I knew there&#39;s still no option there."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"In my understanding what Cliqz did, at least in the beginning, was to buy clickstream data and then build an index on top of that. So in a sense they just scraped Googles&#39; search index, as almost all users rely on Google for finding stuff on the web. The clickstream data gives you both the search query and the website(s) users visit after searching, so it&#39;s pretty easy to build a search index from that, at least for popular searches (it might be more difficult for the long tail of search queries).A lot of the clickstream data you can buy comes from browser extensions btw, and often gets collected without users knowing about it (looking at you, &#34;Web of Trust&#34;). I think their reliance on such data was the reason Cliqz acquired Ghostery, which also collects a copious amount of &#34;anonymous&#34; data from its users. On one hand it&#39;s a neat idea since you&#39;re basically standing on Googles&#39; shoulders, on the other hand it&#39;s at least questionable for a &#34;privacy-first&#34; company as the generation of the search index is based on personal data mined from (often unwitting) users.That said I don&#39;t know how their system evolved, so maybe today they have another way to build their index."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Brave has a long way to go to build real trust. Too many reckless stuff: hijacking links, suspicious url-rewriting, crypto-token stunts, forgetting to communicate with users about serious privacy leaks with their faulty TOR window... also it looks like they care about privacy only in their PR brochures."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"&#34;Killing TurboTax&#34; is essentially a meme until we meaningfully simplify the tax code.There is no software development team on earth who could catch up with the full capabilities of TurboTax without some sort of fundamental shift in the business. I really hate to say this as someone who makes a living out of it, but dealing with the current amount of complexity in the tax code with a piece of software that a non-expert could use is virtually impossible.For the happy path (i.e. single individual, no dependents, no investments, no retirement, rents home), you could certainly build an application that handles these scenarios. The moment you factor in individuals who are bringing stock sales, multiple investment properties, ownerships/K1s and other complex scenarios to bear, its a different hellscape altogether.Also don&#39;t forget that most states have their own independent tax codes as well, which further complicate matters. There&#39;s difficulty multipliers all over this problem domain, and you can be certain that the lobbyists employed by Intuit, et. al. are encouraging this."</p>

If any vanilla oligarch wanted to be in those circles, he would just pay some squeaky-clean individual to be his stooge, and then make it known, after registration, who the real power is. Sunde could have configured himself as a freelance consultant to his friends, and he would not have appeared on any radar. This would have made his business work, but it would not have advanced the perennial conversation about ICANN&#39;s original sins, which have become more and more untolerable with the years.ICANN were pretty stupid to just veto his admission. That&#39;s not how you deal with institutional critics. They could have simply brought him in, then informally and formally vetoed anything he wanted to do. They have experience with people who tried to blow up things &#34;from inside&#34; in the past, so clearly they&#39;ve developed countermeasures ready for that scenario. Or they could have given him something, enough to behold him, so he&#39;d have an incentive to stay in the tent and piss outside rather than the other way around.This attitude proved Sunde is fundamentally right on the subject matter, like him or not as a person."</p>

That essential controls the internet. Yay."</p>

This unnamed group of people concluded that the organization is ‘not comfortable’ doing business with him.It&#39;s the height of arrogance that they didn&#39;t even feel the need to come up with any better excuse, just this.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"We&#39;re all complaining about how js is a bad language, tooling is a mess, and how the web is fundamentally built for documents and makes it hard to create app-like experiences. Now, Google comes and creates a whole new UI toolkit from scratch, couples it with a very beautiful SDK and component framework and offers a far better programming language than js could ever be but we&#39;re still nagging. I was also pretty disappointed with the demo at flutterfolio.com that is supposed to show how great Flutter 2.0 for the web is. It&#39;s not that good but it&#39;s gonna get there eventually, given the hype around wasm and &lt;canvas&gt; technologies. Not to mention that Flutter is already better and easier to use than the existing native tools for both Android and iOS. I believe Flutter is an extremely ambitious project and I appreciate that Google is really trying to give an answer to the problem of cross-platform UI development."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; Google Pay switched to Flutter a few months ago for their flagship mobile app, and they already achieved major gains in productivity and quality. By unifying the codebase, the team removed feature disparity between platforms and eliminated over half a million lines of code.from pay.google.com&gt; Starting April 5, you won&#39;t be able to use pay.google.com to send and receive money from other people. To send and receive money, use the new Google Pay app."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;m currently 5 months into developing a mobile app for a startup with flutter and my experience so far is very underwhelming.Flutter as a framework is not the worst but far from best, it&#39;s very OO while trying to use reacts vdom model which just wants to be functional.The biggest limitation of the platform is Dart - it&#39;s a horrible language that should have died once TS and ES6 became mature enough. And I&#39;ve used dart back when it was supposed to be a JS killer shipped with browsers, used dartium to build a MVP for an app using Angular Dart durgin the betas.Back then Dart was miles ahead in terms of tooling and JS the language didn&#39;t even have async/await - so I was singing it&#39;s praises. But the language stagnated and it&#39;s fundamentals with a nominal type system and a closed object model make the language so inflexible and full of boilerplate it&#39;s incredible. It&#39;s very much like Java (the language, without the powerful ecosystem) and people prefer Kotlin for frontend for a reason. C# is similar but they figured out that they need to build a lot of things in to the language to reduce the boilerplate so they are adding stuff like Records and pattern matching.If you look at state management patterns in flutter there&#39;s probably 5-10 competing approaches all lacking in their own way and all severely hampered by how unexpressive dart is. Or how you deal with serialisation/immutability/etc."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Blog author here!  Thanks to HN for warning me about sscanf at exactly the right time – within a day of me trying to load some ASCII STLs and noticing it was slow...Linked deep in the Twitter replies [1], there&#39;s an open glibc issue about this, dating back to 2014:https://sourceware.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=17577C doesn&#39;t have any requirements on the complexity of sscanf, so it might not be a bug per se, but it&#39;s certainly... a pitfall.[1] https://twitter.com/impraxical/status/1367194430835425283"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I think the really embarrassing part for Rockstar is that they didn&#39;t bother to investigate what took 5+ minutes to load in their star product, a simple profiling would&#39;ve made the issue obvious. So either they knew and they didn&#39;t care, or they didn&#39;t know and they didn&#39;t care.That being said both for GTA and for TFA the issue is a very similar sscanf call:     sscanf(data, &#34;%f&#34;, &amp;f);

I already posted a similar comment in the GTA story but I really want to emphasize it: scanf is almost never the right tool for the job, and it&#39;s definitely not the right tool in this situation. Just use strtof. That&#39;s literally what it&#39;s for. String to float. There. Done.Scanf is crappy and if it were up to me would&#39;ve been deprecated a while ago. I can sort of see using it for a quick one-off &#34;script&#34;, for instance to parse user input, but seeing it in the middle of a program will always raise a huge red flag for me.Use strtok_r if you need to split a string, then parse every entry individually. It&#39;s more robust, more flexible (you can parse custom types and formats that way) and allows for much better error handling and diagnostics. And of course it&#39;s also usually vastly faster.Scanf is an antipattern in my opinion. I literally never use it and I&#39;m better off for it. The last time I interviewed for a C coder position I managed to answer the full C test quizz except for the one question regarding scanf. That&#39;s how much I don&#39;t use it.I think it&#39;s even worse for developers who come from higher level languages and (reasonably) expect to be able to deserialize data easily. You simply can&#39;t do that in C, the type system and general philosophy of the language won&#39;t let you, but scanf may convey the illusion that it&#39;s sort of possible. Don&#39;t believe its lies."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I remember a small story, decades ago, about a company/univeristy which was left holding the bag when the government cancelled their contract. They were constructing a lens system to go into a satellite which could purportedly read the issue date on a dime lying on the sidewalk. It was something like $15M. The implication was that the government had found something even better, and gone with that instead. If Google is publicly giving up on a particular, unpopular technology to buy some PR, I strongly suspect that they&#39;ve already figured out something which will work &#34;better&#34; behind the scenes.There&#39;s a lot of confusion over what this story is actually saying, and, given the obscurity with which Google deals with it&#39;s tech, I don&#39;t think this is going to get cleared up, leaving room for a lot of speculation. But one thing is absolutely certain: There&#39;s no possible way that Google is going to make a change to their biggest money maker that would make them LESS money. Maybe that just means that they consider their duopoly enough of a barrier that advertisers will be forced to accept less-targeted marketing, but I doubt it..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I feel like the phrase “tracking individual people” is how Google is going to keep tracking you as well as they did before.With the announcement of federated learning of cohorts [0], it allows Google to use their massive amount of information they have on you already, as well as their dominance in AI to cut out the easy way of tracking people, and make it harder for anyone else to personalize ads.Don’t get me wrong it’s a good thing that we are removing third-party cookies, but the idea that Google is confident they can track you without them makes me worried for the future of advertising. This move is undoubtedly going to cement google as the best ad tracking company for some time into the future.[0]: https://www.cnbc.com/2021/01/24/google-extremely-confident-a..."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I hope this gives rise to another, smaller viable party outside of Amazon, Google, and Microsoft. Perhaps I&#39;m jaded, perhaps hopelessly biased - but I can only see this as a net negative.Okta&#39;s open source packages receive a pitiful amount of attention (for example: https://github.com/okta/okta-oidc-js/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%...) with forks almost becoming a requirement. Auth0 by contrast has been &#34;on the ball&#34; for a long time with their offerings. Okta&#39;s interfaces have been disjointed and inconsistent, confusing to users on a scale only surpassed by Jira, while Auth0&#39;s have always been pleasant to use from a user and developer perspective.From a personnel perspective, the two companies couldn&#39;t be more different, with Auth0 embracing a remote-first-class culture with creative interview processes, and Okta (pre-covid) being very much the opposite. I interviewed with both, and the process at Auth0 had me walk away with respect, while contrasted with Okta that left me reminded that tech hiring is broken.I&#39;ll hold my breath for a short time that Auth0 is allowed to operate independently. Sadly I feel it&#39;ll be inevitable that they&#39;re eventually swallowed up by the mothership."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I hate this. We moved from Okta a few years ago after we were basically received almost no actual real support for a bunch of issues, even though we were paying a premium cost. Nobody cares about issues on their Github, the kicker was a when we received a support response as suddenly something was no longer working after an update, we got help in the form of &#34;We have no plans to address this anytime soon.&#34; when asking for an ETA.We ended up switching to Auth0, after we had a few calls with them. We shaved a decent amount off our costs with Auth0&#39;s Enterprise plan, and their webtask based rules worked. While the migration sucked for a bit, in the end we were much happier."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Really not a fan of this.Okta as a business are a pain to deal with, and unless you meet their minimum spend requirements (which are not told to you up-front) you&#39;re screwed.I&#39;ve rolled out a ton of commercial products where we started with 1-2 users or a few units of compute, and on the basic little/no support options.When those products succeed, and we can demonstrate that not only does it meet our needs on paper, but it actually works, and whatever flaws that exist are not big enough to stop us wanting to use it more.AWS, Atlassian&#39;s Jira and Confluence, Sendgrid, Mailchip, Duo, and a bunch of others all started being used in orgs where this kind of thing is super low friction and easy to spin up, we plug in a credit card to get us off the ground.Okta? Well they&#39;ll tell you the pricing up-front, that&#39;s great - what they don&#39;t tell you is that after the trial period, you can&#39;t just give them a credit card, no you need to go through the sales process. It&#39;s not until you&#39;re talking to their salesperson that you find out you can&#39;t just start with a few licenses, no, you need to meet their minimum spend figure per month.Well, that idea was dead."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I&#39;ve been trying out the latest master builds of pipewire recently and have been pretty impressed with it:* My bluetooth headset can now use the HFP profile with the mSBC codec (16 kHz sample rate) instead of the terrible CVSD codec (8 kHz sample rate) with the basic HSP profile.* Higher quality A2DP stereo codecs, like LDAC, also work.* AVDTP 1.3 delay reporting works (!!) to delay the video for perfect A/V sync.* DMA-BUF based screen recording works with OBS + obs-xdg-portal + pipewire (for 60fps game capture).For my use cases, the only things still missing are automatic switching between A2DP and HFP bluetooth profiles and support for AVRCP absolute volume (so that the OS changes the headset&#39;s hardware volume instead of having a separate software volume)."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; including the raw Linux ALSA sound API, which typically allows only one application to access the sound card.If the raw in that sentence is not meant as a special qualifier and this is meant as a statement about ALSA in general, this is wrong. I recently read up on this to confirm my memory was right when reading a similar statement. In fact, ALSA had just a very short period where typically only one application accessed the sound card. After that, dmix was enabled by default. Supporting multiple applications was actually the big advantage of ALSA compared to OSS, which at the time really did support only one application per soundcard (without hardware mixing, which broke away at that time). I&#39;m not sure why this seems to be remembered so wrongly?&gt; Speaking of transitions, Fedora 8&#39;s own switch to PulseAudio in late 2007 was not a smooth one. Longtime Linux users still remember having the daemon branded as the software that will break your audio.This wasn&#39;t just a Fedora problem. Ubuntu when making the switch also broke Audio on countless of systems. I was active as supporter in a Ubuntu support forum at that time and we got flooded with help requests. My very own system did not work with Pulseaudio when I tried to switch, that was years later. I still use only ALSA because of that experience. At that time Pulseaudio was garbage, it should never have been used then. It only got acceptable later - but still has bugs and issues.That said, PipeWire has a better vibe than Pulseaudio did. It intends to replace a system that never worked flawlessly, seems to focus on compatibility, and the apparent endorsement from the JACK-developers also does not hurt. User reports I have seen so far have been positive, though I&#39;m not deep into support forums anymore. Maybe this can at least replace Pulseaudio, that would be a win. I&#39;m cautiously optimistic about this one."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Just tried it on NixOS, had no idea it was so fleshed out already! Thought it&#39;d be full of bugs but was pleasantly surprised, it just worked. No issues with compatibility, extremely low latency and has JACK and PulseAudio shims, so everything works out of the box, including pro audio stuff like Reaper and Ardour. And thanks to the JACK shim I can patch around the outputs with qjackctl. This is compared to JACK, which I never managed to properly combine with PulseAudio."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"We recently tried to build a relatively simple PowerApps application - under the assumption it would save time over pumping out a React boilerplate form.  Never again.We wanted it to be able to integrate with our backend which lives outside the MS ecosystem.  No problem we thought - that&#39;s what custom connectors are for.  Except they don&#39;t work with any of the automated form generation functionality.  So we pretty much have to build the form entirely manually.Low code becomes high code all of a sudden - except it&#39;s worse than just coding and learning a new framework.  You can&#39;t just input your code anywhere you want, or import your dependencies, etc... You have to hunt around in a zillion different (laggy as all hell) interfaces to find the right location where that code can live.  Or maybe it&#39;s not code - but a toggle somewhere... OMG... kill me.Good luck if you are trying to learn the lower level aspects... since all the tutorials, blogs, youtube videos - all assume that your data all lives in Sharepoint or some other MS resource - and that your connector actually works as advertised.If you can code - and your stack doesn&#39;t already entirely consist of the MS ecosystem.  Just roll your own."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I just read the overview document (docs/overview.md in that repo), and I have to say I&#39;m blown away.Excel is one of the world&#39;s most popular programming environments, because it has such a low barrier to entry, but it&#39;s limited: the input is always a grid of numbers, and the output is always a grid of numbers, which limits how useful it can be to people outside number-crunching professions.Visual Basic (especially the original, pre-.NET incarnation) let you create Real Windows Apps with all the inputs and outputs that entails (images, copy/paste, files, sliders, textboxes, databases) and let you use a fairly simple and forgiving language to wire them together... but the barrier-to-entry was still a lot higher than Excel, even if it was lower than C++, or even Visual Basic.NET.This PowerApps thing seems like an elegant middle-ground between the two - rich inputs and outputs (images, sliders, text-boxes, databases), with a simple, predictable language to wire them together. The inputs and outputs aren&#39;t quite as rich as Visual Basic, but the shift from native apps to web apps has changed people&#39;s expectations since the days of VB6, so that&#39;s probably an advantage."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"From the overview document:&gt; Microsoft Power Fx is the low-code language that will be used across the Microsoft Power Platform.The emphasized part above is all you need to know to understand that Microsoft Power Fx is NOT a low-code general purpose programming language, as is mistakenly stated in the README document. It might be general purpose in the Power Apps context, but it&#39;s a moot point from the larger perspective. Generally, Microsoft Power Platform and, thus, its subset Power Apps, present a much stronger lock-in risk than Azure and some other products and services."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Also wanted to share my overall positive experience with Clickhouse.UPSIDES* started a 3-node cluster using the official Docker images super quickly* ingested billions of rows super fast* great compression (of course, depends on your data&#39;s characteristics)* features like https://clickhouse.tech/docs/en/engines/table-engines/merget... are amazing to see* ODBC support.  I initially said &#34;Who uses that??&#34;, but we used it to connect PostgreSQL and so we can keep the non-timeseries data in PostgreSQL but still access PostgreSQL tables in Clickhouse (!)* you can go the other way too: read Clickhouse from PostgreSQL (see https://github.com/Percona-Lab/clickhousedb_fdw, although we didn&#39;t try this)* PRs welcome, and quickly reviewed. (We improved the ODBC UUID support)* code quality is pretty high.DOWNSIDES* limited JOIN capabilities, which is expected from a timeseries-oriented database like Clickhouse.  It&#39;s almost impossible to implement JOINs at this kind of scale.  The philosophy is &#34;If it won&#39;t be fast as scale, we don&#39;t support it&#34;* not-quite-standard SQL syntax, but they&#39;ve been improving it* limited DELETE support, which is also expected from this kind of database, but rarely used in the kinds of environments that CH usually runs in (how often do people delete data from ElasticSearch?)It&#39;s really an impressive piece of engineering.  Hats off to the Yandex crew."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I think it&#39;s an unfair comparison, notably because:1) Clickhouse is rigid-schema + append-only - you can&#39;t simply dump semi-structured data (csv/json/documents) into it and worry about schema (index definition) + querying later.  The only clickhouse integration I&#39;ve seen up close had a lot of &#34;json&#34; blobs in it as a workaround, which cannot be queried with the same ease as in ES.2) Clickhouse scalability is not as simple/documented as elasticsearch.  You can set up a 200-node ES cluster with a relatively simple helm config or readily-available cloudformation recipe.3) Elastic is more than elasticsearch - kibana and the &#34;on top of elasticsearch&#34; featureset is pretty substantial.4) Every language/platform under the sun (except powerbi... god damnit) has native + mature client drivers for elasticsearch, and you can fall back to bog-standard http calls for querying if you need/want.  ClickHouse supports some very elementary SQL primitives (&#34;ANSI&#34;) and even those have some gotchas and are far from drop-in.In this manner, I think that clickhouse is better compared as a self-hosted alternative to Aurora and other cloud-native scalable SQL databases, and less a replacement for elasticsearch.  If you&#39;re using Elasticsearch for OLAP, you&#39;re probably better to ETL the semi-structured/raw data out of ES that you specifically wan to a more suitable database which is meant for that."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; SQL is a perfect language for analytics.Slightly off topic, but I strongly agree with this statement and wonder why the languages used for a lot of data science work (R, Python) don&#39;t have such a strong focus on SQL.It might just be my brain, but SQL makes so much logical sense as a query language and, with small variances, is used to directly query so many databases.In R, why learn the data.tables (OK, speed) or dplyr paradigms, when SQL can be easily applied directly to dataframes? There are libraries to support this like sqldf[1], tidyquery[2] and duckdf[3] (author). And I&#39;m sure the situation is similar in Python.This is not a post against great libraries like data.table and dplyr, which I do use from time to time. It&#39;s more of a question about why SQL is not more popular as the query language de jour for data science.[1] https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/sqldf/index.html[2] https://github.com/ianmcook/tidyquery[3] https://github.com/phillc73/duckdf"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This is the best news I&#39;ve heard all week.  The more widely vegan &#34;meat&#34; is available, the more likely it is to be adopted by average people and not just dedicated vegans.Reducing the demand for real beef is probably one of the best things we can do in the short term for the environment, due to the amount of land required for cattle farming, and due to the surprising amount of methane emitted by cattle.

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I enjoy eating meat and have no plans of going off of it completely. But we eat so much of it as a culture.And when you add up every hot pocket, frozen pizza, slider, hot dog, or chicken nugget, it&#39;s hard to argue that most of meat actually being consumed can&#39;t be easily substituted. For something healthier and cheaper too!And I know people blast tech companies for focusing too much on making things flashy and cool, but the people who are making electric cars and fake meat cool are the ones who are going to save our asses while we were busy scolding people for not trying harder to enjoy brown rice."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"He&#39;s kind of totally wrong about the phones and thus the speed being THE killer feature. First of all, Symbian phones, which were the market leader smartphones when the iphone was released were pretty fast. So were feature phones (i.e. dumb phones).What iphone was a LOT better at than everyone else was UX. Of which speed is one component, of course. It&#39;s funny how much people never get it although it happened in front of us, it happened to us. At the time I was working at Nokia Research and I remember my girlfriend telling me how his boss got this wonderful phone that you can take photos with and you can view them, etc. The funny thing is that I had such a phone since 2001. I have been working with smartphones for 6 years then, she knew it, she listened to me when I told her or others what I was doing (and then listen to others responding &#34;yeah, but phones are for making phone calls&#34;). She saw me browsing the net on my phones (a 9210 communicator and then a 9500), send emails from the beach, etc.Still it somehow didn&#39;t register. Because it looked like something that she&#39;d never use. And then the iphone that did a lot less made her and basically everyone understand what a smartphone is. (Even though by then symbian smartphones were pretty common, most people didn&#39;t use them as smartphones.)So no, it&#39;s not simply the speed. It&#39;s the UX. And even if we talk about speed, it&#39;s still not the speed, but it&#39;s the perception of the speed, which a lot has been written about: delay (lagging) matters a lot even if speed on average is OK."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I vividly remember using a kiosk to order a sandwich at a gas station 3 years ago... Not because the sandwich was great, not because it had a great logo, or a great name...The INSTANT I hit the button to complete the order, the built in printer almost spat the ticket at me. I ordered a second sandwich just so I could get a video of that happening again.Edit: Just found and uploaded the video :)

								<p class="story__comment_others">"This I think is a key reason Netflix is a default ‘channel’ in my mind, whereas Apple TV, amazon prime and Disney plus are all just apps.Netflix is faster in every way. There’s a button on my TV specifically to launch it, the videos start faster, fast forwarding is faster, there’s less buffering in general. Every single touch point is fast. And it’s because they put the effort in where the others didn’t."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This is a recent video presentation by Jonah Edwards, who runs the Core Infrastructure Team at the Internet Archive. He explains the IA’s server, storage, and networking infrastructure, and then takes questions from other people at the Archive.I found it all interesting. But the main takeaway for me is his response to Brewster Kahle’s question, beginning at 13:06, about why the IA does everything in-house rather than having its storage and processing hosted by, for example, AWS. His answer: lower cost, greater control, and greater confidence that their users are not being tracked."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I see incredible value in IA collection of books, videos and software. OTOH I&#39;m puzzled by lack of organization.Take for example this newer document: https://archive.org/details/manualzilla-id-5695071  The document has horrible name and useless tags, and the content seems to be only section 2 of some SW manual. How would I ever hope to find it if I needed that exact document?Obviously such huge archive cannot be categorized and annotated by small team, so it would make sense to crowdsource the labeling process. Yet, as registered user I can only flag the item, or write a review. Why doesn&#39;t IA let users label content and build their own curated collections of items?"</p>

It&#39;s extremely important to be accurate with this kind of thing. The discussion below is all based on assuming that that title is literally true.The HN guidelines specifically ask you not to rewrite titles unless they are misleading or linkbait: https://news.ycombinator.com/newsguidelines.html.I&#39;ve changed the URL from https://www.mitpressjournals.org/action/showPublications, which doesn&#39;t explain anything, to the press release which, although it&#39;s a press release, sort of does. Nevertheless it&#39;s hard to figure out what exactly is being announced here."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"To MIT Press, thank you. But without an announcement, I fear that this is just a one time, brief thing.Springer did this awhile ago for a weekend, not its entire catalog but many books were free to download. It was wonderful, but brief. From down thread, https://mitpress.mit.edu/blog/mit-press-launches-direct-openI think it is important for folks to recognize how hard this must have been and how many heated verbal battles were exchanged inside of MIT over this. Thank You. And thank Aaron, always a champion in spreading the world&#39;s knowledge to the most people possible.  We should empower everyone as much as we can with the bits we have available.Folks should check some fun journals likeComputer Music Journal https://www.mitpressjournals.org/loi/comjEvolutionary Computation https://www.mitpressjournals.org/loi/evcoAdd your own below!"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"It seems slightly weird to me that university presses and learned society journals aren’t generally open access. I thought the point was to aid the university’s research. Surely it helps the name of the university to have important widely accessible journals with the university’s name on them. Maybe the presses tend to have been spun off as commercial enterprises, or maybe the university really loves the income. Or maybe they are really expensive to run for some reason. I know the press at my university has a pretty large building but I’d figured a lot of it was a warehouse. Maybe it’s full of salespeople negotiating with librarians.I don’t think there’s much hope of the commercial journals owned by Elsevier or Springer opening up, but I do hope that the trend of journals flipping (where the entire editorial board resigns and forms a similarly named open access journal) will increase.Perhaps another problem is that in those fields that are already closest to open access (say because they use the arxiv), there is less incentive for people to jot publish in commercial journals as everyone who matters will have already read the preprint in the arxiv."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I was working near some game publishers many many years ago, and the case when they would crack the game in order to publish/republish/rewrap installer, localize to some local market or release some critical patch, when the original team was not responsive, not experienced in certain tech issues, had no resources allocated, was drown in bureaucracy, or even was not existing anymore, was not so uncommon.The case when this is breaching original contracts is the well the separate issue. Often times the publisher and developer have different views of the world, - relationships in this industry have always been tense."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"More background from the point of view of Frogware:The Sinking City is Being Delisted. Here’s Whyhttps://frogwares.com/the-sinking-city-is-being-delisted-her...Without wishing to take sides, here&#39;s what seems to be at the root of the dispute, from Frogware&#39;s POV:On June 27, 2019, The Sinking City was released on Xbox One, PS4, and Epic Games Store. That was a great day for us. And once the game was released, we received a letter from Bigben/Nacon that the milestones that were previously approved are being canceled, meaning that we would not receive any profit from the sales of the game. A retroactive cancellation on not delivering a product on time that is already out in the market is not acceptable. That was when our legal battle began.We filed a lawsuit against Bigben/Nacon on August 2019 and, incidentally, only then we started to receive income reports, though incomplete and undocumented. So it was not possible for us to see if the revenue was correctly calculated or even how many units we sold. At some point we received a statement claiming that one of the console manufacturers hasn’t paid royalties for more than 5 months, while actually the same console manufacturer paid our royalties from other games without any delay in the same period of time."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I hadn&#39;t heard of this before, so maybe I am missing some context here, but something seems fishy:&gt; Steam is one of the listed platforms of commercialization in the contract between Frogwares and Nacon. But since the release of the game, Nacon’s unlawful actions have forced Frogwares to defend its property and react in front of the French Justice for lack of payments, attempts to steal our IPs, etc which we made a public letter about back in August 2020.Here&#39;s the previous statement from Nacon:https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/750130/view/30584784...I can&#39;t find any of the details about Nacon&#39;s unlawful actions, and it seems Frogware is being intentionally vague. Doing some digging, it seems like this is almost a complete retread of a legal battle they had before:https://twinfinite.net/2019/09/frogwares-games-delisted-alle...It seems like they may have a history of playing a copyright game with publishers - take their money to develop a game, then use legal trickery to take back the property outright.In this case Nacon may have felt they had a &#34;mechanic&#39;s lien&#34; on the code and felt justified stealing it back outright (probably a bad choice in the long run). But regardless, I don&#39;t get the sense that Frogwares is completely being on the up and up about the relationship with their exes.Update: Frogwares has a much more detailed list of grievances here: https://frogwares.com/the-sinking-city-is-being-delisted-her... Some seem petty and some seem serious. But it still leaves questions. How much did Nacon already pay Frogwares? Does Frogwares plan on paying it back?&gt; The agreement is, therefore, terminated without further formality. Moreover, on July 17, 2020, Nacon attempted to oppose the termination in court, but the judge rejected the demand, and the contract is now terminated in the eyes of the law.Maybe French law is much weirder than ours, but this phrasing would be highly suspect in the US. You would get a really affirmative ruling that you are still bound by contract or not."</p>

Go ahead.&#34;Bitcoin Is A Waste of Time (and Resources)&#34;What Bitcoin has done is that it taught people they can come together in a sustained flash mob (like an on-the-fly hedge fund operation) and manipulate the price of speculative assets by creating artificial short-term pump-n-dump type demand. Bitcoin has trained our collective neural network to do this.The huddled masses can take their new superpower and apply it to stock, crypto, commodities on the commodity exchange, and all kinds of speculative assets, especially the virtual kind.It&#39;s taken a gambling-friendly society with feverish lust for winning (think for-profit fantasy sports, online poker, day trading, Vegas et al) and turned us into a giant decentralized casino."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;m so sick of these profound-sounding blog posts that take 1 million words to say precisely jack shit. Yes, the key innovation around Bitcoin was to order events. You can call this &#39;time&#39; if you want. This is literally the most obvious thing you can say about the system. It&#39;s so obvious in fact that it&#39;s in the introduction section to the Bitcoin whitepaper. Here is the entire blog post written much shorter and more precisely by Satoshi:&#39;In this paper, we propose a solution to the double-spending problem using a peer-to-peer distributed timestamp server to generate computational proof of the chronological order of transactions.&#39;Not trying to be elitist but if you find this topic new then you probably also find Bitcoin&#39;s technical workings new.

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;ll admit, I didn&#39;t read all four articles. I got about half way through the first one and was just wondering &#34;I still have no idea what this is all about.&#34; Fortunately, the Wikipedia article on the author has a brief summary.In particular, I thought this quote from the Wikipedia article really summarizes the differences between older and younger generations: &#34;there is a profound difference between using a racial epithet in the course of a discussion about that racial epithet&#39;s use, and using a racial epithet to diminish or to wound someone.&#34;For &#34;socially conscious&#34; people in my generation (Gen X), I think nearly all of us would find calling someone a racial epithet abhorrent. At the same time, while I understand culture has shifted and I wouldn&#39;t do it now, I still find it quite bizarre that the mere utterance of the epithet, even in a sentence like &#34;You should never call someone a &lt;racial epithet&gt; because that is extremely offensive&#34; is considered itself racist by younger people.I recall hearing about a young popular YouTuber about a year or so ago who was accused of being racist simply for singing along to the lyrics of a popular rap song. Even more strange to me was that his defense (which was true if one looked up his Instagram video) was that he did NOT utter said epithet, in that he was singing along with the lyrics but when it got to that word he just skipped it and didn&#39;t say it.I understand culture changes, but it still bothers me that we&#39;ve gotten to the point where we completely disregard intent and focus instead just on the syntax of what was said. To be clear, I&#39;m not sure if that&#39;s indeed what occurred in Mr. McNeil&#39;s case, but I certainly have seen it in other examples."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; 1. Yes, I did use the word, in this context: A student asked me if I thought her high school’s administration was right to suspend a classmate of hers for using the word in a video she’d made in eighth grade. I said “Did she actually call someone a (offending word)? Or was she singing a rap song or quoting a book title or something?” When the student explained that it was the student, who was white and Jewish, sitting with a black friend and the two were jokingly insulting each other by calling each other offensive names for a black person and a Jew, I said “She was suspended for that? Two years later? No, I don’t think suspension was warranted. Somebody should have talked to her, but any school administrator should know that 12-year-olds say dumb things. It’s part of growing up.”&gt; 2. I was never asked if I believed in white privilege. As someone who lived in South Africa in the 1990’s and has reported in Africa almost every year since, I have a clearer idea than most Americans of white privilege. I was asked if I believed in systemic racism. I answered words to the effect of: “Yeah, of course, but tell me which system we’re talking about. The U.S. military? The L.A.P.D.? The New York Times? They’re all different.”&gt; 3. The question about blackface was part of a discussion of cultural appropriation. The students felt that it was never, ever appropriate for any white person to adopt anything from another culture — not clothes, not music, not anything. I counter-argued that all cultures grow by adopting from others. I gave examples — gunpowder and paper. I said I was a San Franciscan, and we invented blue jeans. Did that mean they — East Coast private school students — couldn’t wear blue jeans? I said we were in Peru, and the tomato came from Peru. Did that mean that Italians had to stop using tomatoes? That they had to stop eating pizza? Then one of the students said: “Does that mean that blackface is OK?” I said “No, not normally — but is it OK for black people to wear blackface?” “The student, sounding outraged, said “Black people don’t wear blackface!” I said “In South Africa, they absolutely do. The so-called colored people in Cape Town have a festival every year called the Coon Carnival where they wear blackface, play Dixieland music and wear striped jackets. It started when a minstrel show came to South Africa in the early 1900’s. Americans who visit South Africa tell them they’re offended they shouldn’t do it, and they answer ‘Buzz off. This is our culture now. Don’t come here from America and tell us what to do.’ So what do you say to them? Is it up to you, a white American, to tell black South Africans what is and isn’t their culture?”I fundamentally don&#39;t understand why the Times didn&#39;t explain this early on. Not necessarily release these statements verbatim, but certainly provide some of this context."</p>
