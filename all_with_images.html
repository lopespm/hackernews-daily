								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I love Yandex.  They are the best search engine by far for politically controversial topics.  They also release a language model to benefit everyone even if it says politically incorrect stuff.  They also name their projects &#34;cocaine&#34; probably to perhaps to prevent western competitors from using them.You look at OpenAI and how they don&#39;t release their models mainly because they fear &#34;bad people&#34; will use them for &#34;bad stuff.&#34;  This is the trend in the west.  Technology is too powerful, we must control it!  Russia is like... Hey, we are the bad guys you&#39;re talking about so who are we keeping this technology from?  The west has bigger language models than we do, so who cares.  Also their attitude to copyright and patents, etc.  They don&#39;t care because that&#39;s not how their economy makes money.  Cory Doctorow&#39;s end of general purpose computing[1] and locked down everything is very fast approaching.  I&#39;m glad the Russians are around and aren&#39;t very interested in that project.[1]https://csclub.uwaterloo.ca/resources/tech-talks/cory-doctor..."</p>

People are yelling at eachother about the CIA and the legitimacy of Israel and Assange and the definition of fascism and… anything that pisses anybody off about international politics in general. In a thread about a piece of software that’s (to me and likely many others) prohibitively expensive to play around with.Anyway I hope somebody creates a playground with this so I can make a computer write a fan fiction about Kirby and Solid Snake trying to raise a human baby on a yacht in the Caspian Sea or whatever other thing people will actually use this for."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"To add a voice of skepticism.  The recent rush to open source these models may be indicative that the tens of millions that’s spent training these things has relatively poor roi.  There may be a hope that someone else figures out how to make these commercially useful."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This might be overreacting but is there a way to opt-out of Copilot using your code in open source repos?It feels morally wrong to me that I can spend thousands of hours working on projects on my own free will but then a company can sell the code I wrote to others in the form of snippet completion as a service. In fact they end up selling your code back to yourself if you plan to use the service.If the answer is no, that moves the needle pretty far in the direction where I&#39;d at least consider the idea of moving all of my repos to Gitlab. I don&#39;t care much about stars or popularity. I open source things that are interesting and useful to me and if other folks want to use it they can but I don&#39;t gain motivation from others using the projects I release. I like Github and its UI and it&#39;s no doubt &#34;the spot&#34; for open source but selling code written by others rubs me the wrong way a lot. It stinks because it also means no longer contributing to other code bases too. It&#39;s moving us in the opposite direction of what open source is about."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I find this whole topic very annoying, this is like the 3rd variation to reach the front page today. But it has made me realize why I instinctively dislike Free Software as a movement.Copyright and licensing are bad, actually. Stop getting worked up about the idea of using courts to punish theft. Stop getting into a frenzy of arousal about the police kicking down doors to drag Billy Gates to jail because 80 characters of fast square root is theft but 79 isn&#39;t.Where on earth is the ambition and vision!? Knowledge is public domain. A commons of knowledge is a public good. The cost of code copying is zero.Sure in our day job we have to pretend to care about this stuff. But when did the ideological scope of what can be achieved become rules lawyering over license text.Copy my MIT licensed code without attribution? I don&#39;t give a shit, go ahead, I hope it helps, in fact I want a truly public domain license but copyright law is so hostage to corporate interests no such thing exists in many countries.Free the code."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"It is now proven that copilot returns code from codebases with non-permissive licenses [1].I&#39;m curious - what are the legal implications of this going forward? I&#39;ve so many questions.1. Will Microsoft ever face lawsuits for these license violations?2. If so, who/how? Class-action?3. Will copilot be forced to open-source in the future? Under which license? Some open source licenses are incompatible with others, but copilot uses code from probably every OSS license conceived.4. If Microsoft faces no justice, will we start seeing more OSS license violations? Will Google start using AGPL-licensed code?[1] https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=27710287 | Copilot regurgitating Quake code"</p>

Instead of naming my script foobarnator (and hence risking that another foobarnator may exist in the future and may clash with my script), I name my script foobarnatorToBeAliased.sh.  Then in my list of aliases I alias foobarnator to foobarnatorToBeAliased.sh.The alias itself looks a bit weird in that to pass arguments to an aliased command you need to use a function (in Bash at least AFACIT) but it all works fine.As aliases aren&#39;t sourced when other scripts are running, I&#39;m sure my scripts/commands ain&#39;t ever going to clash with anything.I&#39;ve been doing that since years.It also works fine to add &#34;wrappers&#34; to existing commands: for example to add additional input sanitization catching common mistakes I&#39;m making when calling some commands."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Ya know, it’s funny. I like Python. We like it enough to actually use it in embedded products. It has its limits, and we use other tools where it doesn’t fit. Python in a browser seems like a keen idea.But JavaScript vs Python isn’t really the key thing for me on the web. It’s the uncanny pile of other software one uses to build a man-machine connection that flummoxes me. It’s the CSS, the DOM, the events, the browser API, the ever churning massive pile of complexity that interactive software has become with the voluminous W3C specs, expressed in near BNF form and full of edge cases and backwards compatibility, all so every thing my user does can be observed by myself a few megacorps. I honestly wouldn’t care if I could write it in Fortran. It’s such a minor wart of the whole mess.Caring about which actual language you can use in all the script tags of a jacked up text format feels like caring which font is being used in your favorite hot piece of government legislation."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The article describes what is possible with Python in a browser, but misses an important detail: how much memory it consumes and how much CPU it uses.Python is not a fast language. For example, consider a simple loop:    for i in range(10):
        pass

In Python, this will be compiled into: a call to range(), heap allocation of an Iterable, calling getIterator() on an Iterable (which might also do allocation), calling next() on an Iterator while catching for StopIteration exception (and calls are often slow in interpreted languages). While in C we could just have a loop without any calls.I remember how I had to use a Dart-based web application (compiled to JS) in one of Google&#39;s advertising products. The script weighed around several megabytes and everything was so slow. Furthermore, there also was a small and useless &#34;what&#39;s new&#34; applet, and it probably was shipped with a separate copy of Dart runtime because it weighed several megabytes too. Obviously this was a product intended to be used only on latest MacBooks, not on a Windows XP laptop.It is totally fine to write such application for youself, or maybe for internal use, but if you are a corporation with millions of users, I think you should pay a little attention to performance and choose a better technology. Or, if you are of a Google scale, find a way to optimize the code."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"  &gt; But there is another aspect of the language that makes it so desirable from his standpoint: it can be extended with binary extensions that use an API that is written in C, but can be accessed from other languages. He likens Python to &#34;a Honda Civic with mounting bolts for a warp drive&#34;. So the language can be picked up by kids who can then pop open the trunk &#34;and bolt on warp nacelles&#34; that allows the code to run faster than C or C++ in some cases, Wang said.
  &gt; 
  &gt; That aspect is sometimes overlooked, but it means that Python can be used in ways that other, similar languages cannot. &#34;It&#39;s not just like Node, it&#39;s not just an alternative to Ruby&#34;.

Both node and Ruby have a comprehensive C API, this is a very common language feature since binding to native libraries is unavoidable. Is there actually anything different about python here?https://nodejs.org/api/n-api.html

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I like Rust and I&#39;d love to see it in the Linux kernel, but not before the GCC+Rust issues are all fixed. You shouldn&#39;t need non-GCC compilers to compile Linux and from what I can tell there isn&#39;t any GCC Rust compiler that&#39;s fully equivalent to the standard Rust compiler just yet.They say that Rust support is optional, but when the first big driver gets written in Rust it&#39;ll become mandatory. So either the Rust integration will fail and nothing important will get written in it, or it won&#39;t be optional. I&#39;m not sure what comfort that&#39;s supposed to bring."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"EDIT: It is very bit unfortunate that my general/off-topic comment is currently the most upvoted. I was not commenting on the Linux integration specifically. I&#39;m a _novice and hobbyist_ when it comes to Rust.For example this comment https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=31849071 is much more interesting and on topic.---I want to provoke a little bit, but I&#39;m genuinely curious about the following:I feel like the Rust ecosystem is still quite immature in a lot of areas. Just a few indicators to illustrate what I mean:- Both async/await and the question mark operator feel like rushed implementations, neither seem like the best long term solutions for Rust and are not in line with the otherwise solid foundation of the language.- Open source code examples sometimes use an array of external dependencies that are unrelated to a given project and feel arbitrary. This reminds me of the JS ecosystem.- Some projects pride themselves to not use &#34;unsafe&#34; code, including linking with battle tested C code, which seems like an arbitrary restriction that sounds better than it actually is. There is even an open source maintainer that got mobbed out from his own project because he used &#34;unsafe&#34; in places that others didn&#39;t agree with.- Rust is fashionable. Putting &#34;Rust&#34; next to a HN title immediately gets clicks and upvotes. SO surveys and similar report high interest in the language. This is not an inherently bad thing, quite the opposite. But as a secondary effect it might detract from objective, technical decision making.I really like the language, I have _way_ more good things to say about it than bad things. But am I alone in feeling like this? Other modern language communities come with a philosophy that promotes stability and simplicity. Is the Rust community riding on the merits of Rust&#39;s unique value proposition, while forgetting some important fundamentals?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is my humble opinion, but kernel shouldn&#39;t be a place for language diversity. Even code comments should be standardized for such critical and complex project with so many participants."</p>

This way, I can just go to my search site, and search for something, and anything related that I&#39;ve indexed before pops up.

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I (still) use Pinboard: https://pinboard.in/u:pratyush  Reasons:
  1. Archives - those tutorials and guides stay when the original pages go 404
  2. API - I use the api to automatically post my bookmarks to my blog
  3. Full-text search: this is very very useful when needed
  4. Social Discovery: Search that niche website / app on Pinboard. It shows lots of other people who found that same thing as interesting. We can then follow them and subscribe to their favourites as RSS feed."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I have tried many different solutions the last two decades, but none of of them really stuck or became useful over time. I kinda gave up and as a last ditch effort started to do the simplest thing I could think of: ctrl+D to add bookmarks in Firefox, jotting down a few keywords on each entry. No folders, no structure, just a flat list and some keywords.A few months in I noticed how powerful this simple system was. When talking with someone else about a tool, github-repo or article I had seen but did no remember the name or title of, finding it back was suddenly a breeze. Since I keep my desktop and mobile bookmarks in sync, it it just a matter of typing in a keword in the address bar in firefox and it shows up instantly!On desktop, you can limit the search to bookmarks only by starting with a *, which is helpful to avoid browser history etc.I have really low bar for adding a bookmark now as the mental overhead is so low and it is done notime. It has become the second brain I always wanted :)"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I’ve been following Zeihan since his first book. I’m yet to find a credible counter argument to his theses. And he’s being proven right at an alarming pace this year.So far this year we’ve had:- A land war in Europe- Food insecurity in the developing world- Breakdown of supply chains and shipping routes- Nation states resorting to seizing each other’s ships (see Greece-Iran issue recently).Everything that he had talked about in the past and in his latest book.The thing about Zeihan’s arguments is that you can’t really argue against demographics. You can procure any resource from any part of the world, but if you want an 18 year old to consume or work or fight, you HAVE to wait 18 years. Or import them from elsewhere - which causes all sorts of cultural and societal conflicts."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Interesting to combine this line of thinking with the transition from nation-states to market-states:https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/1744057060106386...The power vacuum that&#39;s arisen from populism &amp; isolationism is about to create a gigantic untapped market for firms that provide the services of a state - defense, dispute resolution, and currency - for a fee, to gigantic multinational corporations.  At the same time, there are nascent technologies (drones and robotics for defense, blockchain and the Internet for dispute resolution &amp; currency) that dramatically lower the cost of many of these services, to the point where we may see private companies that are more effective than nation-states at it.  Might we see the nation-state get replaced by a web of competing mercenaries, each of which effectively serves as a protection racket for their customers?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Haven&#39;t read the book, but for those who don&#39;t know who Zeihan is, his work follows two threads of post-WWII history:1. Deglobalization; and2. DepopulationThe article focuses mostly on deglobalization, but depopulation is in the horse pulling the cart.Many are familiar with the deglobalization idea from the last US presidential administration. The current administration kept those tariffs, and abided by the previous commitment to exit Afghanistan. Zeihan argues that this trend toward increasing isolationism goes back decades.What may seem less familiar is the demographic implosion the entire world is undergoing - a baby bust. The vast majority of major countries with the exception of the US and Mexico have passed a point of no return demographically. Their populations will shrink with mathematical certainty. As their populations ebb, so will their economic growth prospects and place on the world stage. The problem is especially pronounced in Asia and Europe, but can be found everywhere.The reason for the bust: people moved to cities. On a farm, kids are free labor. In a city, kids are expensive conversational pieces."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&gt; sometimes probably best just not tell project manager and do it 80/20 way. easier forgive than permission, project managers mind like butterfly at times overworked and dealing with many grugs.In my experience, I have to fight to keep my devs from over engineering their solutions and just get something going.I&#39;d love to work with a dev who&#39;s happy to think about how to most quickly deliver value and who&#39;s willing to help with the cost-benefit analysis for each suggested feature.Problem is, for that, you need a developer who cares about and deeply understands the use case/the product. Many of the devs I&#39;ve had to work with were more interested in building pristine codebases with clever abstractions and ability to scale to unnecessary numbers of users or bytes."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"When I was half my age, OBS was unfathomable. I was shooting video on digital 8, editing in Final Cut Pro 4 which was the new hotness, and trying but failing to use DSS on my college network. Actual streaming at scale required a massive server and a massive license from RealNetworks. If I wanted to do anything with animation, it was all $$$$$ software. This all took place in a shared lab at my college with stuff I could never afford on my own.Today, people at that age are making lucrative careers out of streaming then doing the things they love out of their bedrooms using OBS. Blender has enabled all kinds of amazing creators, from animation to video editing to 3D printing and even (basic) architecture. Kicad makes EDA! approachable.  My teen son has been able to dabble in all of the above in his spare time without spending a dime.I’m in awe of the power of free software and the amazing engineering work that has enabled these projects to be good enough for real professionals to choose first. I hope we see Godot achieve world domination in gaming,  GIMP in graphics, and Libra Office + Collabra in productivity. The people who have given us these tools deserve the highest accolades."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"For those who haven&#39;t tried it, you can mount the output of OBS as a camera, which can be used as input for something like Zoom.  So you can add graphics, multiple angles, switch between different views, etc..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Self-promo:In case anyone is interested in controlling OBS remotely, you can use OBS-web: https://github.com/Niek/obs-webIt&#39;s not a full reimplementation of the UI, but offers the most often used controls so you can manage a livestream from e.g. a tablet or phone."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I&#39;m one of the authors of this. Happy to answer any questions.One of the fun technical details is that, when enabled on a machine (tailscale up --ssh), the userspace tailscaled process takes over all TCP port 22 packets after the WireGuard decryption and doesn&#39;t even feed them into the kernel over TUN. We use gVisor&#39;s netstack to handle the TCP connections in-process.So it doesn&#39;t matter whether you have other processes (or iptables rules, etc) that would prevent the Tailscale SSH server from binding to port 22. This lets people gradually use Tailscale SSH over time without messing with their system one.The Tailscale SSH server currently only runs on Linux but there&#39;s support in git main for macOS too but it&#39;s not super well tested yet and not included in the sandboxed GUI builds currently."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;ve been having trouble adopting Tailscale. As so many others say, relying on another identity provider is unfortunate - I, too, worry what happens when Google decides to lock me out because some algorithm decided my account is fishy.The biggest blocker has been the issues with the Android client. I&#39;m either hitting https://github.com/tailscale/tailscale/issues/915 or https://github.com/tailscale/tailscale/issues/4611, but neither issue appears to have a fix coming soon. Whenever I am on my carrier&#39;s network, my phone&#39;s internet stops until I disable Tailscale - that&#39;s just a show stopper from using TailScale.So instead of developing this SSH feature, I would have preferred to seen them work on their bug backlog.In the meantime, I&#39;m experimenting with ZeroTier. While it doesn&#39;t have the ease and cool magicDNS+LetsEncrypt feature, I think I&#39;ll survive with something more reliable."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;m very interested in Tailscale for both personal and business use-cases, but I&#39;m rather put off by the stark centralization of offered identity providers: Microsoft, Github (Microsoft), Google, okta (?). What are the chances that Tailscale would offer authentication using decentralized/self-hosted identity providers like Ory ( https://www.ory.sh/ )?"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I hesitated a little bit before deciding to purchase and go through the book. Had already read many glowing reviews then, but was not sure if the choice of language (Java) for the first half of the book would be a hindrance (it&#39;s not the stack I am most familiar with).Decided to buy it anyway, primarily because the two implementations of the toy language piqued my interest (most other books only go through one implementation).Boy was I glad I did.Writing is superb, end-of-chapter challenges are instructive, code samples are meticulously and beautifully done. Here and there I also encountered references to other languages (e.g. had a brief detour to Lua internals [1], thanks to a side note), which I have enjoyed too.Went through the first half twice: first using Java as it is written and then secondly implemented the interpreter in Rust (my initial fear turned out to be unfounded). Currently going through the second half.So if you&#39;re reading this, thank you, Bob :).[1] https://www.lua.org/doc/jucs05.pdf"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Without a doubt one of the best technical books I have ever read.To me, it was a missing piece of the big puzzle of &#34;how do computers work&#34;. I read many a book to answer this question, and came away with three books:- CODE by Charles Petzold explains the CPU- Operating Systems: Three Easy Pieces by Arpaci-Dusseau explain OSes- Crafting Interpreters by Robert Nystrom explains programming languagesMasterfully done."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I love this book! My only gripe is that I wish it was a whole series, no, a whole genre of books. We need more hands on, code first books that take you through 1-2 extended projects where you can type along and get working code at the end. These books should have CS theory, but still be fundamentally focused on implementation. It&#39;d be really fun to have one of these for a more functional compiler (type checking, code generation, optimization), for a language service (query based compilation, concrete syntax trees, language server protocol), for databases, operating systems, and so on. Ideally they&#39;d be a cross between an O&#39;Reilly book and a SerenityOS stream"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"My reaction to this is that it&#39;s an effort to keep users within the &#34;walled garden&#34; of Twitter, which is not the best thing for those that write.Recall the story with Medium - yes, you get broader reach with less effort, but at the cost of giving up control of your content.I know that I am talking with an overly developer-focused lens (a-la &#34;you can reimplement Dropbox in a weekend&#34;), but self-hosting blogs outside the &#34;walled gardens&#34; is not super complicated even for non-power users. Ghost has existed for years and is a very user-friendly experience. Want to be a bit more technical - go the static site route.It might be a lost battle to convince the majority of the social media audience of this (after all, can&#39;t beat the convenience and the cost of $0), but I really do not see this as beneficial to those that deeply care about their long-form writing accessibility and sustainability.Twitter already has login walls to just read tweets, so I&#39;d imagine the same is likely to apply to long-form content as well."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"While it&#39;s all well and good to launch new features, I think Twitter should improve their existing service and I&#39;m referring to low hanging fruits.I don&#39;t understand the rationale behind cutting me off while I&#39;m scrolling through Twitter simply because I&#39;m not logged in. Twitter can still display Ads to me irrespective of whether I&#39;m logged in or not. In fact cutting me off means I leave Twitter which means I don&#39;t see the Ads they&#39;re selling which in turn means less Ad money for them.Even when logged in, Twitter will display the new message/note icon. When I click on it to read the notification, it turns out to be Twitter telling me to turn on notifications. Now normally, once you have read the message, the &#39;new&#39; message/note icon is cleared. Instead Twitter displays it again almost immediately and this then goes on for the next few hours before they stop.If they can&#39;t fix these simple things, why would someone want to read longer content on Twitter. They would still get cut off again as Twitter is doing for existing tweets"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I welcome this. I always hated the long multi-tweet essays and have often just given up on reading them, especially when I&#39;m not logged in I can&#39;t even make it to the end before twitter blocks me from scrolling further.As of now it doesn&#39;t look like you can reply to a note with another note? That might go a long way for improving debate and discussion."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Important to remember that combustible cigarettes are terrible and e-cigarettes are a slightly less terrible alternative to those. In a world where cigarettes are  so terrible however, e-cigarettes end up saving billions in health care dollars and quality of life.Of all the e-cig players, Juul (which is now majority owned by Altria) is the most reputable one — by far - they have by far the best technology, quality controls, compliance and regulation teams, etc.Unfortunately before Altria acquired Juul it was a terribly ran company. People spend a lot of time discussing the chronic youth issues but the reality is that Juul never wanted to sell to youths or anything of the sort — they were just _so_ incompetent at operations that they couldn&#39;t do anything.They set fire to hundreds of millions of dollars on totally ridiculous projects plainly stupid ideas:* A modular supply chain project with the idea that they could use manufacturing as a carrot for regulatory laws — this team was 50-100 people and had tens of millions of dollars in budget. Never did anything.* All manner of vanity innovation projects: new battery technology, next and next and next generation projects, dozens of flavours, absurd marketing campaigns, rebrands, a $250k custom typeface, the list goes on.* Hired McKinsey and Bain because the executive team (who were all ex-management consultants) wanted the company to move fast ....* My personal favourite Juul story (ok I have a bunch) was that the company was so incompetent they didn&#39;t do headcount planning — You could just hire as many people as you wanted if your random (often incompetent) VP was okay with it. Juul had 50-100 VPs so it was sheer chaos.It got so bad that Altria had to step in and install their own CEO and axe all of the existing executive team (and lay off thousands of random employees) to try and right the ship. Altria are a very legit operational business — you may not like them but they know how to work with the FDA within strict regulation guidelines. If Juul is removed from the market despite Altria taking over they&#39;re truly fucked.In my time at Juul I have never worked with so many incompetent people. 
It was quite impressive but also incredibly depressing as someone that joined because the idea of creating a connected device vaping product to help switch Americans off combustible cigarettes was very compelling."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I managed to give up fags over four years ago after 30 odd years of smoking around 20+ a day.  I&#39;m still quite surprised that I managed it but in retrospect I did a mental job on myself - you have to be hard but in the end it wasn&#39;t quite as bad as I thought it would be.  If I can, you can but you need to find your strategy.Initially I thought that I&#39;d transition to e-fags and climb down from there.  Nope.  You are trading one habit with another - it doesn&#39;t matter if a e-fag cloud is better for you it is still not good and keeps you tethered to smoking.  I think it would be quite easy to go back to tobacco if you &#34;allow&#34; yourself to vape as a transition.I rapidly realised that once I started down the abstinence route I had to be very hard with myself.  It wasn&#39;t actually that bad in the end.  I came up with two mantras that I repeated to myself in my head whenever I really wanted to smoke:  they were - &#34;I don&#39;t want to smell&#34; and &#34;I don&#39;t want to die&#34;.  They are pretty self explanatory.I did and sometimes still have dreams about smoking.  It is a very insidious habit.  I was a smoker for 30 years so it is obviously still a part of my life at age 52 but it is fading and I rarely have to say my mantras these days.I had another strategy too, which helped in the short term:  I started my give up, in the early afternoon of day one (Easter 2018 as it turns out) and had a very long lie in on day two.  That got me to over 24 hours with minimal stress.  I then progressed to a series of time based targets:A day (tick), two days ... a week ... two weeks ... (tried a drag on daughter in law&#39;s fag - no thanks) ... a month ... two months (weird dreams) ... six months ... etc ... four years."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The worst thing about this was that openoffice was starting to get some name recognition before oracle killed it, and this whole debacle intentionally or unintentionally turned that name recognition into a weapon against LibreOffice.Ideally they should have given LibreOffice the OpenOffice name, but even if they had just said &#34;openoffice is dead&#34; then it would have been easy for people to find libreoffice.Unfortunately, by taking over the OpenOffice name and absolutely refusing to admit that development has ceased, Apache has caused tons of confusion that has massively harmed libreoffice, because for years people who had heard about &#34;openoffice&#34; would see the terrible, out of date, insecure pile of junk being distributed by the Apache Foundation and not realize that the actively developed LibreOffice was available.In the case of linux distributions it was less of an issue since they just switched to LibreOffice, but I wouldn&#39;t be suprised if there are windows users who are still downloading OpenOffice (and possibly taking one look at it and giving up and switching to Office 365).Apache should have killed OpenOffice years ago but at the very least they should take it down and honestly apologize for fucking this up so badly.Even ignoring the harm to LibreOffice it&#39;s just irresponsible for Apache to keep distributing OpenOffice when they can&#39;t even make new releases to simply apply security patches for years."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The mark of a good open source maintainer is the ability to, when your personal interest wanes, find a new maintainer and hand over.I&#39;ve done this several times, and certainly development went on much slower than before, but them&#39;s the breaks. At least I did the right thing.For such a big organization, with so many open source projects under its big wing, Apache has failed on this mark of maintainership completely. It failed so badly that at this stage, deploying Apache-maintained software for a customer or employer is downright irresponsible.Would you organize all your company&#39;s internal communications around Google&#39;s latest messaging thing? That&#39;s insane, you know it&#39;ll bite you in the ass in a few years time when it gets cancelled. Apache is no better."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"To be honest I never understood why Apache even started in the first place. By that time the LibreOffice fork was well underway."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This stifling of competing ideas, say a growing number of scholars, is a big reason why there is no treatment for Alzheimer’s. (The four approved drugs have no effect on the disease, providing only a temporary memory boost.)Those who championed the amyloid hypothesis truly believed it, and thought that focusing money and attention on it rather than competing ideas was the surest way to an effective drug.Or maybe the real problem is the excess emphasis on finding a drug in specific that can be commercially monetized. A single drug for a single cause of what is likely a complex process.Amyloid and another protein (tau) accumulate in the brain due to sleep deprivation.  Helping people get a good night&#39;s sleep -- without drugs -- would likely help, if only to stave it off in those at risk.The problem is it won&#39;t create any razzle dazzle &#34;unicorn&#34; companies and newly-minted zillionaires.One of the researchers in the article found that herpes simplex infection promotes the accumulation of amyloid. Her research was not irrelevant to the amyloid hypothesis.  It was only irrelevant to an agenda to find a drug to treat amyloid."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"FTA, contradicting the headline (emphasis mine):&gt; Despite being described as a “cabal,” the amyloid camp was neither organized nor nefarious. Those who championed the amyloid hypothesis truly believed it, and thought that focusing money and attention on it rather than competing ideas was the surest way to an effective drug.This discrepancy indicates part of the problem: the investigators narrowing the search for causes honestly believe in what they&#39;re doing.The NIH review panelists really believe they&#39;re safeguarding the NIH budget, and the Pharma execs really believe they&#39;re wisely allocating their R&amp;D budget."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"There is no better way to get shut out as a scientist than to disprove the career-making findings of the important people in your field. One of the side effects of this is the “discussion does not match the results” paper. It’s routine to read papers where the discussion blatantly contradicts the papers own results. What is happening is the authors are disclaiming their own findings in order to get past hostile reviewers, betting that astute readers will notice the contradiction, ignore the discussion and draw their own conclusions from the results."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Docker going strong :-)Unsurprising, really. The usefulness of it cannot be overstated.Doesn&#39;t even matter if its used anywhere in the deployment chain; simply having the ability to pull up a replica of almost any *nix environment on my laptop in mere seconds, using it for tests, and then throwing it away resetting it again in mere seconds is beyond awesome, no matter if what I&#39;m working on then goes into a huge complicated deployment chain, or is shoved onto some on-premises, zero-abstractions, baremetal server.And how is it all configured? Plain text files. How is it controlled? Command Line. Meaning I can script it every way I want, using the tools I already have and use. Doesn&#39;t get in the way, doesn&#39;t demand that I work around it...it works with me and my tools in the same way they already work together.Oh, and of course, good bye and good riddance to the days when I had to install and configure local RDMS for tests. Everything I use has an official image, so I just write some small setup script, a Dockerfile, knit everything together in a docker-compose.yml and presto, done: Application stack is up and running.To me, Docker is as essential as my text editor these days."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Ruby is missing entirely in the [1] Salary and experience by language.156 People responded were programming with Crystal professionally. A language that is still very very young.Even ignoring Node.Js, there are 3x [2] more Django developers than Rails.If people thinks Phoenix is young or niche, it has half of Rails professional usage in this survey.Django&#39;s current position should be what Rails tries to achieve. 15% usage is enough for a market sustainable position.Some Google developer told me Fresh Grad or Junior Software Engineers gets $200K Total Comp per year. That is equal to the median salary of Senior Executive (C-Suite, VP, etc.) in the US. When developers with 5 - 10 years of experience are calling for a &#34;fair&#34; $400K Total Compensation on Twitter. Someone on HN once said Google Senior SWE make up to $700K.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I&#39;ve been using Copilot for a few months and...Yeah, it makes mistakes, sometimes it shows you i.e. the most common way to do something, even if that way has a bug in it.Yes, sometimes it writes a complete blunder.And yes again, sometimes there are very subtle logical mistakes in the code it proposes.But overall? It&#39;s been *great*! Definitely worth the 10 bucks a month (especially with a developer salary). :insert shut up and take my money gif:It&#39;s excellent for quickly writing slightly repetitive test cases; it&#39;s great as an autocomplete on steroids that completes entire lines + fills in all arguments, instead of just a single identifier; it&#39;s great for quickly writing nice contextual error messages (especially useful for Go developers and the constant errors.Wrap, Copilot is really good at writing meaningful error messages there); and it&#39;s also great for technical documentation, as it&#39;s able to autocomplete markdown (and it does it surprisingly well).Overall, I definitely wouldn&#39;t want to go back to writing code without it. It just takes care of most of the mundane and obvious code for you, so you can take care of the interesting bits. It&#39;s like having the stereotypical &#34;intern&#34; as an associate built-in to your editor.And sometimes, fairly rarely, but it happens, it&#39;s just surprising how good of a suggestion it can make.It&#39;s also ridiculously flexible. When I start writing graphs in ASCII (cause I&#39;m just quickly writing something down in a scratch file) it&#39;ll actually understand what I&#39;m doing and start autocompleting textual nodes in that ASCII graph."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;ve been using the beta since last year and I love it. I think most of the people complaining about it either haven&#39;t used it, or are judging it on its most verbose guesses. That&#39;s not what I use it for mostly. For me, it&#39;s just a really, really good autocomplete. It&#39;s best for things with common patterns and APIs. But hey, they&#39;re common so I write them a lot. Boring stuff like creating a Response object, adding the right headers and response code. And look, it&#39;s worked out that I need a case for a 404 next, and has suggested the code for that to, and a 500 in my catch block. Sure, that&#39;s not much typing or cognitive load, but added up over many, many times then it&#39;s easily worth it.And no, I&#39;m not a beginner. I&#39;m a principal with over 20 years experience. I don&#39;t really use it for the Stack Overflow-type stuff, but even as an autocomplete it&#39;s worth the money. As it happens I&#39;m apparently eligible for free access as an open source maintainer, but I&#39;d pay $100/year in a heartbeat for it. I&#39;d pay for Intellisense if that was $100 too."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This has been the biggest productivity improvement to my workflow in yearsNo it doesn&#39;t &#34;understand what I&#39;m doing&#34; or &#34;get everything right&#34; but that&#39;s hardly the pointIt&#39;s often reducing the amount of labor I&#39;m doing by hitting the keyboard by guessing 90% correctly what I was going to typeIt also often saves me from having to google how to do something, it&#39;s effectively serving me a search result right along my codeI&#39;m lucky to be getting it for free but would have immediately paid $10. It needs to only save you minutes a month for that to be worth itAlso the comments about it being &#34;unfair their monetizing other people&#39;s work&#34; are missing the point.Github has created a product that many people use and through that effort created a large repository of code.They are now releasing a product that is going to create a large amount of of value in time saved and are maybe capturing 2% of that. This is a great outcome for everyone"</p>

You don&#39;t need to know much if anything about how the database engine executes queries, you only need to implement the callbacks it needs to do its job.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"We use Cloudflare to serve ~20-30TB of traffic a month where I work. Was the SRE on call when I got paged on our blackbox monitoring/third party web checks failing..It was very pleasant to find the cloudflare status page pointing me to the issue right away (minutes after our alerts triggered), even though I couldn&#39;t replicate the issue myself yet.I wish more companies would take note of the transparency and sense of urgency on updating their status page. (Looking at you Azure)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The default way that most networking devices are managed is crazy in this day and age.Like the post-mortem says, they will put mitigations in place, but this is something every network admin has to implement bespoke after learning the hard way that the default management approach is dangerous.I’ve personally watched admins make routing changes where any error would cut them off from the device they are managing and prevent them from rolling it back — pretty much what happened here.What should be the default on every networking device is a two-stage commit where the second stage requires a new TCP connection.Many devices still rely on “not saving” the configuration, with a power cycle as the rollback to the previous saved state. This is a great way to turn a small outage into a big one.This style of device management may have been okay for small office routers where you can just walk into the “server closet” to flip the switch. It was okay in the era when device firmware was measured in kilobytes and boot times in single digit seconds.Globally distributed backbone routers are an entirely different scenario but the manufacturers use the same outdated management concepts!(I have seen some small improvements in this space, such as devices now keeping a history of config files by default instead of a single current-state file only.)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"One of our sites uses Cloudflare and serves 400k pageviews per month and generates around $650/day in ad and affiliate revenue. If the site is not up the business is not making any money.Looking at the hourly chart in Google Analytics (compared to the previous day) there isn&#39;t even a blip during this outage.So for all the advantages we get from Cloudflare (caching, WAF, security [our WP admin is secured with Cloudflare Teams], redirects, page rules, etc) I&#39;ll take these minor outages that make HN go apeshit.Of course it helped that most our traffic is from the US and this happened when it did but in the past week alone we served over 180 countries which Cloudflare helps make sure is nice and fast :D"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Advice regarding VCs: Don&#39;t ever talk to them if they randomly approach you saying they &#34;really like what you&#39;re doing&#34;. They will gladly sent an associate to talk with you about your business in the greatest detail and ask you to share presentations, demos and metrics. Anything you give them will then get passed along to their own portfolio companies in your space. So don&#39;t feel flattered when they feign interest in your company, they&#39;re mostly just doing reconnaissance. Ignore it as chances are you&#39;re feeding them information they&#39;ll use to kill your company.If you&#39;re really interested in VC funding you should proactively approach VCs (ideally using introductions by your network) that seem suitable. And you should check beforehand that they don&#39;t fund your main competitor."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Thanks for this writeup, I can relate 100%, especially the part on the supportive spouse. I&#39;ve built WunderGraph (https://wundergraph.com/) as a solo-dev for multiple years until I reached a similar point like you. It&#39;s weird to say, but my wife kind of accepted that I&#39;d work on weekends between 1-3 pm when the kids sleep. What helped me get out of this &#34;solo-time-drain-thing&#34; was to find the right Co-Founders to help me. I&#39;ve found a really nice guy to help me with Marketing, and another one who helped me develop the Product. &#34;If you want to go fast, go alone. If you want to go far, find a team.&#34; I hope you can find some way of financing so that you can push through this wall. For me, it was working a full time job and building WunderGraph at night and on the weekends, but it&#39;s making you age quickly. I wish you the best for your future."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"From the post:&gt; For example, it is integrated with GitHub in such a way that on every push it will provision a new server running specifically that code, deployed to the edge, worldwide, and persisted permanently. Want to access the code your app was running a month ago at commit f7c5e19? It will be served up instantly at a moment&#39;s notice. It costs you nothing to have that bit of JavaScript responding to requests indefinitely.These things sound great and almost a dream come true but how realistic is it to consider being able to do this in most web apps? As soon as your application uses a SQL database and you have database migrations then you&#39;re out of luck because a commit from 2 months ago might expect a different database schema than the current version and while it&#39;s common to migrate in backwards compatible ways, the backwards compatibility is usually only temporary until you finish migrating from A to B.Long story short, this sounds cool but in practice is really only applicable to static sites or dynamic sites where you plan to keep a version of your database and code base backwards compatible from day 1 to current day (which I&#39;ve never seen done in any app developed over the last ~20 years of freelancing for many different companies). The post mentions &#34;The open source Deno runtime shows how clean and productive a modern, batteries-included, programming environment can be&#34; so it sounds like they expect you&#39;ll be running database backed apps and not only static sites."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Interesting how this will play out. It&#39;s an ambitious goal to consolidate client side and server side javascript ecosystems which is quite fragmented today. On the other hand, this may only increase fragmentation further by introducing another target to develop for (wait for transpilers that can automagically convert between deno and node code). I will always look at javascript as this problem kid that cannot get its shit together in life, perpetually chasing the romance of utopia."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Deno overstates the problem it is intended to solve because its founders needed to justify achieving funding by being developer-famous.Let&#39;s say a company were to adopt this tech over Node, well, it seems like it would be slightly better, but probably not much of a game-changer.I&#39;ll leave it to y&#39;all to talk about what tech is truly interesting as I don&#39;t want to seem ideological/biased, I just don&#39;t see how Deno is particularly notable."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This seems like the least of the negative impacts nextdoor encourages.i removed myself after months of watching people on this app become more and more paranoid, feeding off each other.the breaking point was when someonea put out a warning that someone had knocked on their door at 7:00pm, “the wife and i were eating dinner when the rude knock came. we crept over to the window, peeked out, and didn’t recognize the person. be careful!”the person knocking turned out to be a 16 year old girl who lives three blocks away who unfortunately got a flat tire and was hoping to borrow a phone to call her dad.we live in an incredibly safe wealthy suburb and these people “crept” to a window like they’re in an old west shootout and decided to put out a warning on nextdoor about a little sixteen year old girl.we still laugh just thinking how crazy these people must have looked while creeping from their kitchen to peek out a window in one of the safest areas in the state at a time of day when people are still out mowing their lawns.nextdoor somehow just adds to these people’s already insane creeping paranoia."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"NextDoor: home of the dumbest people on the Internet. They must be proud of that.There are occasionally things I want to see on there: a new Costco going in where the OSH Hardware used to be, or whatnot. So I got the daily email digest. One email per day -- tolerable.Then it stopped coming. I wrote to Support, and their guy swore it was still being sent! I said &#34;no, it&#39;s not. I looked in Spam and Trash.&#34; He swore again that it was going out, and I should &#34;check with my email provider.&#34;I asked &#34;How do you know they&#39;re going out? Did you look in the Sent folder?&#34; He got all sniffy and said &#34;We are unable to disclose anything about our internal operations.&#34; Ooh, big secret!So I wrote to the Nextdoor handle on Twitter. They told me there was an experiment going on. I asked if they could take me out of it. They did and all was good again.Except other people on Nextdoor were also unhappy about being in the experiment, and asked me how I got out of it. I told them; they tried it; Nextdoor now refused to do it for them.Think about it -- almost every site on the Web is trying to get you to sign up for a daily email. Nextdoor already has one, and they&#39;re trying to take it away."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Nextdoor wins my prize for the scummiest human manipulation to increase user signups I&#39;ve witnessed.I live in the UK in a cul-de-sac with about 25 houses in the street. We&#39;ve lived here about 4 years and have a dog so we have bumped in to all the neighbours and know all of them by name at least.I get a note through my door from NextDoor claiming to be from a neighbour in my street with a name that we did not recognise. Apparently this neighbour had signed up for NextDoor to keep our street safe and exchange important information yada yada yada...Needless to say it&#39;s total horse shit - none of us are using their scummy platform and have absolutely no desire to.So they&#39;re preying on people&#39;s fears, and hoping that some kind of FOMO plus the fear of being stabbed in your sleep if you don&#39;t know what&#39;s going on in your street will get people on to their platform."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"HDMI offers so many protocols I didn’t know of.Before finding a way to use DDC on Apple Silicon [1] for Lunar (https://lunar.fyi), I contemplated creating a universal DDC/CI device that can change brightness, contrast, volume, input and colors of a monitor, by either receiving commands through HTTP, or acting as an Adaptive Brightness standalone device.In my mind, it would have been an HDMI dongle with an ESP32 that gets power through the 5V line of the HDMI port, and which has an ambient light sensor to adapt brightness by itself.In the end, I found the I2C APIs on M1 so this was not so sorely needed anymore, but given the limitations of the M1 Display Coprocessor, I still think it might be a good idea. I just have no idea where would I start with hardware distribution and mass production, this domain seems so intangible from the software development side.[1] https://alinpanaitiu.com/blog/journey-to-ddc-on-m1-macs/"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; For example, let&#39;s imagine you invite an external guest for a presentation inside your company. You offer to connect to a video-projector so he can show his slides. This is the perfect opportunity for the guest to hack the video-projector. Next time an employee connects to this projector, his laptop is hacked back.Is there a single proof of concept of this out there? This seems wildly theoretical to me.Seems like you have to know:* the projector/TV model/firmware* the employee laptop and firmware* a bug in the projector/TV that would let you insert arbitrary data in a way that will stay around and be sent to other devices that connect to HDMI* a bug in the laptop that would let you install something malicious with the data could get the projector to send* your hack wont be detected by software on the laptop or the IDS/whatever on their networkThat’s pretty heavy lifting. I mean is any of that reasonable outside of nation-state level attacks?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The main thing I&#39;d be interested in blocking is Ethernet:* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HDMI_Ethernet_ChannelWith televisions having all sorts of questionable software installed that wants to phone home, it&#39;s probably best not to connect them directly, but rather stream things to the display from either your mobile device or a box (e.g., Apple TV).Of course if you accidentally do connect it online via a box that does have Internet access, who knows what kind of Lovecraftian horrors will be enabled on the television."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I do a considerable amount of long term travel carrying about half of this, but it all depends on what you&#39;re trying to optimize for. My personal design goal is that my bag fits under airline seats, so I never have to worry about gate checking a bag and risking lost luggage.  The main tradeoff is that I do a lot of laundry in sinks - you really learn the effectiveness of detergent when you see the color of the water coming off some clothes you thought were pretty clean.  These days I&#39;m a bit lazier and try to end up somewhere with a washing machine every week or two to break up the hand washing chore.  I&#39;ve done the towel wringing trick but it&#39;s not all that necessary with my clothes unless I&#39;m in a damp environment and am short on time.The two things that I mostly agree with - eSIM is a massive improvement (I also use Airalo), and I&#39;ve also tried to standardize on USB-C (except for my headphones, where I haven&#39;t found a good replacement).  /r/onebag does have some good product recommendations but is somewhat skewed to young backpackers.I would encourage everyone to ignore anyone telling them they&#39;re &#34;doing it wrong&#34; when traveling. You know yourself, make your own decisions. Personally, making an effort to meet digital nomads all around the world sounds like hell on earth to me. Also, it&#39;s wasted effort. Trust me, they&#39;ll find you and tell you all about themselves."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is interesting because I tend to think of packing as a dirtbag thing rather than a nomad thing... when I&#39;m hotel hopping for extended periods I just bring normal luggage. Maybe I should start bringing my backpack instead.My first impression is that this is a LOT of clothes and the electric stuff is a bit weird.A few differences between dirtbag and nomad (the latter AFAICT is mostly hotel/airbnb hopping?):First, you think a lot about food and water. Especially water, and especially sans car. It&#39;s VERY heavy and very necessary.Second, my emergency pack is almost completely different. No vitamin shoppe merch. An ACE bandage, 8 aspirin per day from civ, 1 dose of imodium per day from civ, gauze, anti-bacterial cream, tape, suture kit, and one dose of a more powerful pain killer for serious emergencies if you can get it. No rapid tests (travel usually required a PCR anyways), but a couple KN95s. Cash in both USD (clean, unfolded, new bills) and the local currency. Maps.Third, weight really matters.Fourth, cleanliness really matters. You&#39;re essentially homeless. Diners and cafes kick out homeless people if you try to stay 9-5. In addition to organizing my life around being clean, I also had a whole separate emergency &#34;Not A Dirtbag For A Day&#34; kit.I guess the other big difference is that all of my day-to-day stuff fit in roughly 15L so that I could carry 5L water and my gear could consume the other 20L."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;ve spend months at a time, e.g. Sicilian island hopping, with less than this. For me the critical issue, which drives all clothing choices, is being able to independently do laundry. That is easier in frequent small batches; I can&#39;t imagine traveling with eight T-shirts!After washing clothes, layer them in a large wringable synthetic pack towel, roll, and twist. Then they can be hung without dripping, and will dry in a fraction of the time. Wring out the towel and repeat. Or, if one has just arrived at a hotel with towels for four, get busy before they clear three of them in the morning.One needs an ample supply of travel-scaled clothesline and clothespin equivalents. I last traveled with tiny Nite Ize Gear Ties, and a few larger ties with loops for securing the clothesline ends. Be thoughtful about attachment points; foreign construction quality can often be surprising.I can&#39;t praise highly enough merino wool T-shirts, even in the hottest weather. I found mine on closeout; they can be expensive.The Aranet4 CO2 meter is an interesting pandemic choice. I own one for monitoring my classroom assignments; they&#39;re very well made."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The Wirecutter is a highly flawed review site, but at least it&#39;s a real one. There are vanishingly few left for general consumer products. There&#39;s WC, Consumer Reports, and what else? They&#39;ve seem to have all been killed off. When I&#39;m researching some category of product, I feel lucky if I find any professional reviews written by people who have actually touched the thing they&#39;re reviewing. I know we&#39;ve all had the experience googling &#34;reviews of X&#34; only to get overwhelmed with SEO spam. Forget finding something written by somebody who has experience with it. It&#39;s hard enough to find something written by a human."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This article actually makes a bunch of claims itself that are false. For example, it claims that the Wirecutter believes air filters work like sieves. Whereas the Wirecutter review page for air purifiers goes into how they do not behave like sieves and also references a NASA study that shows how HEPA filters are good at capturing both particles smaller and larger than the 0.3 micron test standard.It’s pretty obvious that the Wirecutter has used HEPA standard filters as a filter for whittling down the many air purifiers that exist in the world. They eliminated the IKEA filters because they do not meet HEPA standards (this blog’s focus on he true-HEPA marketing term is misguided, because the authors own referenced wiki link shows that E12 is not considered HEPA). However, they also reached out to IKEA about this, and the IKEA spokesperson told them their focus is on PM2.5.They don’t recommend the IKEA filter based not on its inability to capturer finer particles, but because it’s not AS efficient as capturing finer particles as HEPA filters, AND because of its lower CADR.It doesn’t meet the standards they set, so they don’t include it for price comparisons.Maybe they haven’t set the right standards. Maybe they should have allowed for lower CADRs or for filters that meet lower filtration standards than HEPA.However, the insinuation this article makes that they don’t seem to understand what they’re talking about is completely wrong.Maybe this author should try reviewing over 20-30+ different air purifiers at a minimum without setting arbitrary thresholds up front and then get back to the Wirecutter folks."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Wirecutter is like Leetcode interviews.The goal is not to find the &#39;best&#39; option, but minimize false positives under intense time-pressure. Their recommendation is usually the 8/10 solid option that you can blindly buy and be moderately satisfied with. In the process, they drop out or misrepresent other comparable options, but their final recommendation is never shoddy.This is in stark contrast to other reviewers like IGN who give 10/10 to every new cash-cow game, and The-Verge that tows the &#39;mainstream&#39; line to play it safe. Additionally, Wirecutter&#39;s guides are up-to-date and cover every imaginable category. Are rtings, Anandtech, LTT, Crinacle, notebookcheck, gsmarena, etc. better ? Yes, a 100%. But each of them cover a small niche and particularly leave out appliances of all types.I agree with Dynomight on Wirecutter being mediocre. But, consistent mediocrity is incredibly hard to execute at at scale.I would never use wirecutter unless I absolutely had to. But, often, I absolutely have to. Because no one else remotely trustable is going around reviewing humidifiers and vacuum cleaners."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I feel like hating on Jira is the pastime that is now passed down from each generation of programmers to the next.I&#39;m going to stick up for Jira. I certainly don&#39;t &#34;love&#34; Jira, though I do think they&#39;ve made significant improvements with &#34;new Jira&#34; (I think they call them team-managed projects now).The problem I have with the incessant Jira bitching is that I rarely feel that bitchers have a true understanding for the extreme difficulty of the organization-wide problem Jira is trying to solve. It&#39;s always taken on from the position of &#34;well, it didn&#39;t make my specific use case easy&#34;, but never with an appreciation with some of the complexity that Jira needs to solve for other users at your company, never mind other companies.Obviously some of the complaints (speed, stability) are very valid, but here&#39;s a question I think is just as valid: why don&#39;t you think some other company has come along and toppled the Jira crown? Certainly tons of them have tried, and while many have their supporters, they are almost equally likely to have their detractors.The fact is, building a generic project management and tracking tool is a really difficult, hard problem. In my old age as a programmer I feel like Jira is kind of like our form of government: &#34;Jira is the worst project management tool, except for all the others&#34;."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"OK, so what don&#39;t I like about Jira?1. It&#39;s extremely slow.2. It&#39;s difficult to predict the effect of making any kind of change.3. The permissions system is so convoluted, I can be the admin of a board, and yet not have permission to see a ticket on it.4. It relegates the conversation to a second-class UI element, when this is the most important part of any project management system.5. Trying to operate on a bunch of tickets all at the same time (e.g. move all tickets in this status into some other status) requires a lot of time.6. Every Jira setup is so different, trying to compare a piece of work from one area of the organisation to a similar piece of work elsewhere is useless.7. The UI is extremely buggy. I can add a mandatory field to a ticket, then when I try to use a shortcut to create a new ticket, it won&#39;t work because I can&#39;t fill out that mandatory field.8. There are random side-effects when one person does something on one bit of the system, and VOILA everybody&#39;s workflow is broken, with no obvious warning that would happen."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I wish the comments were more specific about which features they don’t like.For me a particularly frustrating aspect is the way the UI moves around a lot. I’m quite anxious to click anything until all the loading spinners have stopped in case I click the wrong thing. Then I could be taken to a page or feature I’ve never seen before.Also it’s really annoying when I try to copy something from a ticket description but it starts editing the whole description field.EDIT - I&#39;d also like to add that as a developer, once I finish my ticket I assign it to a QA. Then I can never get back to the ticket. I&#39;d like a really easy way to see all of the tickets I&#39;ve ever completed. But completed tickets aren&#39;t assigned to me, they&#39;re assigned to QA."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"One big advantage not mentioned in the article particularly relevant to this audience:  git diffs (or your VCS of choice).  One sentence per line means diffs will operate per-sentence, rather than per-paragraph.  This way the diff can capture the restructuring of the paragraph (adding/removing/replacing a sentence), which gives much more insight than swapping out the paragraph wholesale.  It also means minor changes (e.g. typo fixes) will only add+delete a single sentence, making it much easier to identify what has actually changed from one commit to the next.I take this a step further and will often split out a single sentence into a clause per line, but this is a judgement call rather than a hard and fast rule."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I personally use this approach but mostly because a lot of what I write ends up in a git repository and diffs make way more sense when there is only one sentence per line. I also find things much easier to manipulate in vim when sentences don&#39;t span lines."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I remember struggling to write essays when I was in highschool. Well, I was fine, but my teachers insisted it was long-winded gibberish. Concerned, my grand’mother told me: “Ask Sonia” I knew she was her friend, and they liked to argue a lot, but I was a bit confused by the advice.It turns out, editing was Sonia’s job: she was the head reader at a very prestigious publishing house, meaning she was giving notes and feedback to very famous authors, including four Nobel Prize laureates. You kind of have to know what you are doing when you are sending a manuscript full of red in the margins and the person can respond “I’ve got a Nobel Prize and you don’t.” She definitely had the icey stare to match.Oddly, her advice was incredibly simple, and fitted in two very short pieces:* Subject, Verb, Complement –– in that order. If you see two verbs, but a period between them.* Things are confusing if you don’t put them in order: start by the beginning, find the widest piece of context that explain the rest.I don’t apply her rules every time, but for every technical document, every time I’ve tried, it’s been night and day.That typographic argument is really resonating with me."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"First of all, I really like the concept of grid based flow charting. It&#39;s one of the popular metaphors used in &#34;wiring&#34; software based musical instruments and effects and works really well for a significant percentage of signal flows that don&#39;t have too many back looping or crossing virtual wires.However, would it be possible to make the flow go vertically rather than horizontally?I find that a vertical direction of flow is- more practical because of the ubiquity of mouse wheels for easy up/down navigation compared to the various less common ways of navigating horizontally- the much more common direction for sequential steps in programs or scripts- more culturally global, since there are quite a few right to left languages (as in addition to the left to right language used on this site :-)- distance between boxes is easier to keep constant vertically while still allowing different size boxes (due to longer or shorter labels)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Hey all, author here. Graphs are used for tons of purposes across a lot of disciplines, but we don&#39;t have a fast general-purpose graph editor. That&#39;s what I&#39;m trying to do with knotend [0]. It&#39;s a keyboard-driven directed graph editor. I made it for myself for planning project dependencies. It&#39;s also a great tree editor.I actually posted a very early version as a Show HN [1] which you can see was mostly met with question marks, and rightfully so. It was literally a grid, with the gridlines rendered, and had very cryptic keyboard shortcuts. I&#39;ve spent the last year just working on the UX, to make an intuitive and fast editing experience.I&#39;d love more feedback especially about any UX issues. It&#39;s free to use the purely client side version, and you can join the waitlist [2] if you want a user account to persist graphs to the backend (I&#39;m slowly onboarding people).- [0] https://www.knotend.com- [1] https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=27256861- [2] https://www.knotend.com/waitlist"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; After dragging around boxes for a few minutes you need to take a break and ice your wrists. It&#39;s just too slow, there&#39;s too many micro-interactions, and it distracts you from what matters most: defining your dependencies.This is an interesting claim. I&#39;ve programmed LabVIEW professionally and didn&#39;t have to take breaks every few minutes. And neither do PC gamers.What about PlantUML and other text-based diagramming solutions? How do those compare here?"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Think few people realize how bad the Apple situation is. If your company just ships like an iOS app and an Android app maybe you don&#39;t really notice or maybe don&#39;t care.But work at a company where you try to build something like new hardware devices or systems without having to resort to building either an iOS app or handing over 30% to Apple and the situation becomes very worrying to dire. Simple things suddenly become impossible or have workarounds piled on top to get their browser to function in the ways their desktop one does or Android&#39;s browser does.You can feel some of their engineering choices are actively hostile against anyone trying to exist outside the App Store ecosystem. Sure I know some advocates push this as a good thing but I think they&#39;ll disagree when the endgame plays out.Because in 10 years, what currently exists as the only option on iPad and iPhone will be the only option on MacBooks too. There is a reason why the last WWDC was all about making the iPad feel more like MacOS and making parts of MacOS feel like iPadOS.I used to be a huge Apple advocate but I&#39;m really worried with where they&#39;re heading as I&#39;m trying to create new technology and Apple causes so much pain when you try to make anything other than an iOS app.I do love my M1 MBP, have a lot less love for my iPhone these days but I&#39;m worried where the tide is moving. It&#39;s all absolutely fine, until it isn&#39;t and then the problem is it&#39;s completely locked down from the touch screen to the silicon..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"It&#39;s a good article in many respects, but its logic unwittingly falls down when they try to have it both ways, advocating for an outcome that is functionally impossible. From the article—&#34;It’s great when Apple chooses to defend your privacy. Indeed, you should demand nothing less. But if Apple chooses not to defend your privacy, you should have the right to override the company’s choice. Facebook spied on iOS users for more than a decade before App Tracking Transparency, after all.&#34;The important thing to appreciate is that App Tracking Transparency isn&#39;t something Apple can enforce with code. It&#39;s not an API or operating system feature which shields users against tracking. Enforcement is purely the threat of retribution by Apple, made legal by the terms of the agreement which all developers sign. Apple&#39;s monopoly on iOS app distribution means that a wilful breach of Apple&#39;s privacy policies is a dangerous path for any developer to take.I cannot see any plausible scenario where an Apple made impotent through legislation could possibly result in a net gain of privacy control for consumers. And even if there is a better way, how about we get that working BEFORE tearing down the current imperfect system?That paragraph is a layer cake of wishful thinking. How does the EFF propose to enforce a consumer right to override Apple&#39;s choices over privacy within iOS? This kind of rhetoric is unhelpful, eliding reality on so many levels. The notion of consumers self-policing their own privacy is a nice sentiment, but as an idea that must be implemented in reality... rather optimistic."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"It&#39;s worth mentioning the case of tumblr - a giant social media company that was literally worth hundreds of millions of dollars. People remember the whole &#34;wow, tumblr was so stupid for banning porn&#34; but forget that the reason they did so was because Apple threatened to remove all of their users from tumblr if they didn&#39;t. Apple gave tumblr unreasonable &#34;safety standards&#34; that almost single-handedly killed a gigantic site for the vast majority of users.Apple should not have this type of power. Maybe they used it for good with Facebook, but I wouldn&#39;t count on it always being the case. Apple can kill entire social media platforms if they want to. IMO, it&#39;s a matter of time before they start charging an &#34;adult tax&#34; (that just so happens to be barely below the profits a company makes from adult content via Apple users). Maybe the only thing preventing them from doing so is regulatory pressure."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This might be the most interesting and important point:&#34;The thing is, this banning/terminating/deleting troll crap has been going on since I first got my modem in 1986. I’ve been on every popular web platform, every one — and I’ve been “un-platformed” each time, because of specious complaints. The emerging media companies court early adopters, and then they can’t get rid of us fast enough.&#34;She participated in the famous WELL, back in the 1980s. It is interesting how long this particular struggle, over moderation policies, has been going on.She makes a good point that each of these companies has followed a similar pattern of first courting the kinds of radical experimenters who blaze new trails, and then later kicking them off platforms because they are not respectable:&#34;This has been going on for decades now. It isn’t just Google, it’s all the majors: Apple, Amazon, FB, Twitter, Microsoft, AOL, on and on. I could name a dozen others who’ve disappeared in the social media mist. It’s cruel that each of them censor the very people who created their original incubators. Did you know that On Our Backs was the first magazine, of any kind, to publish with an early Apple computer and Adobe Pagemaker 1.0? Yes, we were. I was on The WELL in the 80s. Our idealism and commitment was ferocious!&#34;"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Looks like the account got restored. Seemingly, nothing got erased, the account was just temporarily unavailable.&gt; Needless to say, the OOB lecturers were fully clothed and rather obsessed with our historical narrative. Anyone not interested in feminist politics would have probably fallen asleep.The lecturers perhaps, but the streamed lecture contains full-screen examples from pornographic magazines that obviously should be flagged for verification by any porn detecting algorithm.Youtube does state that explicit materials are allowed for educational content, but if their copyright machines can&#39;t even distinguish white noise from copyrighted music then I have very little hope that context like &#34;educational discussion&#34; will ever be recognised automatically.As a society, we may need a platform where educational/government institutions can upload content (with content warnings, if necessary) because Youtube is a terrible fit for content like this. Youtube&#39;s scope is too large to be managed by humans who can understand context and their advertiser seeking behaviour provides an incentive to &#34;punish&#34; videos containing even allowed nudity in their self-learning algorithms. Requiring every institution to set up their own video hosting infrastructure is unnecessary and even wasteful of public funds."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; The First Amendment, or anything close to it, is MIA on the Web.... she declared, uncensored, from her self-hosted journal.A multinational Fortune-500 megacorp declined to host Cornell&#39;s content for free because they have standards the content violates. Cornell has more than enough cash in the ol&#39; war chest to spin up their own video hosting. This is almost a non-story because it&#39;s either telling us something we already know about how corporations treat potentially-embarrassing-to-them content or how society treats the content Susie Bright creates.ETA: In addition, YouTube does not appear to have decided not to host the content after all (it was likely found initially objectionable because they can code a recognizer for &#34;objectionable&#34; more accurately than a recognizer for &#34;educational value&#34;). This doesn&#39;t change the fact that YouTube is within their rights to choose not to associate with Cornell as a business arrangement, but it perhaps matters that here, they didn&#39;t even make that choice."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Orkut was nothing like current social networks. It didn&#39;t have any kind of feed. You had to manually visit user pages if you were looking for something. Also, user pages had no &#34;blog space&#34; for posts, just main description, &#34;testimonials&#34; (for friends describing you) and scrapbook (like a public email inbox, later turned optionally private). Oh, and a photo gallery.Another thing that was massive in orkut - but still niche as most users didn&#39;t use this feature - was community forums. It was great to be able to read and talk about any topic using the same account, in the same website and the same layout. Worldwide, what filled this gap was obviously Reddit, but it&#39;s still English-only for most subjects. Also the format is different, Reddit is not a typical flat internet forum."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I wish him the best on this endeavor. We&#39;ve bought, rebuilt, redesigned Fotolog in 2017 and we failed to lift the social network, even with 50M users. The only solution I saw to this problem, isn&#39;t technology but convincing people to come back or use this social network over others.I have learned that social networks obeys to generations more than to features. People only switch when a new generation operates on the social network. So, in order to make Orkut succesful, the founder will have to work hard to convince the new generation (those who know have 15yo onwards up to 24yo) to use the platform and gain ownership."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Orkut was big in India too. But far from fake profiles or hate groups, brigading groups etc. The reason it got so big was the users were from populous countries. 
Also, one main reason for its success I believe was that we did not have mobile phones or landline phones and we had lost touch with our friends and it was a platform to reconnect. There was no number portability. If you had lost the landline number of your friends or if they had moved to different regions, the number would have changed. With Orkut groups it was easy to find and message and connect. But later with Facebook and LinkedIn, most of them got on there. 
I cannot comment on what the new platform will do to keep on a mission that it did not fulfil earlier.Shameless Plug: I am working on a social platform with a similar mission and might do a Show HN in the coming months :)"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Ah this article put the finger on why I don&#39;t trust my &#39;new dentist&#39;:The operation is just too slick from a business POV. As someone familiar with SaaS or in general this kind of recurring business model, you can sense all the little operational policies and procedures designed to increase your LTV.It&#39;s a well-oiled machine. Without fail, the hygienist recommends cleaning not once every 12 months or even every 6 months, but every 3 months. When pressed on why, eventually they&#39;ll admit it&#39;s how nice it feels to have clean teeth and how important your smile is - but NOT strictly necessary for health.This particular dentist also will shut down and take their entire staff to a resort for a week every winter if the team &#34;hit their targets&#34; for the prior year. That&#39;s the literal phrase they used to explain the trip. When I asked what those targets were, the person turned bright red.So dentistry has a trifecta of factors that will encourage dark-patterns: (1) a true health-related reason for going both preventatively and to deal with problems; (2) a cosmetic / vanity-related reason (white teeth), and (3) the air of higher-educated medical authority.Wrap that all in a lucrative recurring business model and of course it&#39;s going to lead to people taking advantage or at least overpaying for what they really need.Just writing all this out made me realize I shouldn&#39;t be going to my current dentist! Thanks OP. :)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Throwaway because I run a large dental software company.Dentistry is practiced as a business focused on maximizing revenue. Dentists are routinely coached to deploy sales tactics to increase their treatment acceptance beyond what is needed. If you walk into a dental office, you need to protect yourself from being abused. A second opinion unfortunately puts you in the same position, but now with a new dentist who will play into the narrative of only needing to monitor your condition for a while.The business of dentistry is unfortunately antithetical to conservative treatment, which is almost always in the interest of the patient, because it results in significantly lower patient lifetime value."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is a truth about corporate dentistry, and it common in family practices but less so.I used to know a few dentists. One was a conservative, family dentist with a small home office in a small home (and a mountain of savings). He had a good rep bc he earned it. The other two had a bit more extravagant lives, and they earned it through specialization (and in my opinion, probably a little bit of this article).What consumers should be most concerned about is the end of family practices, and the start of corporate 1800-DENTIST/Supercuts for dentists. Issues like this article are the norm, and instead of a local dentist to seek resolution with, you’re doing the equivalent of filing a Jira ticket with a faceless insurance conglomerate.This is the trend the industry is going bc of the costs and difficulty of owning a practice. If you can, I recommend finding a young dentist who has recently bought into a home office partnership, and stick with them until corporate dentistry takes over. It is the only way to consistently avoid situations like this article."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I&#39;m the cofounder at Lumina - we&#39;re building a modern webcam designed to solve some of these problems.There&#39;s really been a lack of innovation in the entire home office space, with the webcam being particularly bad. It sucks that a decade-old product (Logitech C920) is still the bestselling product today -- that would be like if Apple stopped releasing new phones after the iPhone 4S (launched 2012), and it remained the bestselling phone through now.A few thoughts to add to the article:- On why webcams aren&#39;t seeing innovation, I&#39;d disagree that the market is too small. There&#39;s enough gross margin to produce a $B company just by selling webcams [0], especially if you can actually get customers excited about the product.- A big reason there hasn&#39;t been innovation is that the space doesn&#39;t attract entrepreneurs (because hardware is viewed as hard) or investors (because hardware is viewed as hard).- Size isn&#39;t everything. As the iPhone shows, you can get very good image quality from a tiny sensor and lens if you have the right tech supporting it. (At Lumina, most of our eng effort is on the software layer)I would&#39;ve loved to see Lumina in his comparison. We launched a few months ago and are seeing many reviewers prefer us over the Brio (Logitech&#39;s flaghip) [1]. Personally, I&#39;d guess we&#39;re 60% of where we can be in terms of quality and think we can achieve a quality level between an iPhone and a DSLR, hopefully closer to the latter.[0] https://s1.q4cdn.com/104539020/files/doc_financials/2022/q4/...[1] https://www.windowscentral.com/lumina-ai-webcam-review"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"There is a reason that for hundreds of years painters and (later) photographers have preferred working in spaces with North-facing windows[0], and that is because it&#39;s a simple way of ensuring neutral, even light.  My home office is (by design) in a room with one North-facing window.I use a Logitech C920.   Many people have told me how good my webcam feed is.   I don&#39;t think it&#39;s that the C920 is particularly brilliant, it&#39;s that if you know even a little about photography, you can do an awful lot to help ensure a good picture.[0] assuming they were in the Northern Hemisphere, of course"</p>

You will be able to use your iPhone&#39;s camera as a webcam wirelessly with your Mac by just sticking your phone on the back (Apple is partnering with Belkin[0] for this stand) [1]I personally don&#39;t care about the camera as much as I care about the sound quality.[0] https://www.theverge.com/2022/6/6/23156834/apple-iphone-webc...[1] https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2022/10018/"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I find it really strange where some privacy debates have gone wrong, and this is a perfect example. It&#39;s basically a form of &#34;don&#39;t trust them, better trust us, also we&#39;re in a country with better privacy laws&#34;. Which is an imperfect solution at best, and given that I have no idea who bunny.net is it&#39;s a questionable one at best.If you embed a font hosted somewhere else you expose some of your user data to them. Now with fonts there&#39;s a really simple solution: Just don&#39;t. As an added bonus, hosting fonts on your own server is faster as it goes through the same HTTP connection.There are situations where you can&#39;t completely avoid privacy issues, and then you can try to do better than others. But if you can completely get rid of a privacy issue then obviously that&#39;s what you should do."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Do not use this, use Google Fonts, just self-host them. This site claims better privacy, but does so using the wrong solution since you still have to trust them.Self host (supported by Google Fonts but not by this service):
- Better privacy
- Better performance (no extra DNS lookups, TLS connection)Their default embed code is a CSS 
@import directive. These must never be used in production code (It&#39;s fine as a directive for the compiler for local files but not with remote URLs). Leads to FOUC and FOIT.Also, next step in amateur hour: They serve their CSS and fonts on the same domain as their marketing website. Cookies galore."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"It is. I generate the Windows executables for a program by cross-compiling Rust on Linux. Then test with Wine. The Rust crates are cross-platform enough that I don&#39;t have to special case platforms. This is easier than having a Windows machine.The only current headache is that there&#39;s no pure Rust bundler, to make &#34;.msi&#34; or &#34;.msix&#34; installer files.If you dump the legacy OS stuff, it gets easier."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Counterpoint for this rant (showing it&#39;s again not very objective, and just what your or your environment&#39;s expectations are): it&#39;s easier to cross-compile binaries for Linux (using Clang and a sysroot on Windows) than it is to natively compile on Linux (not using a sysroot, as that is the &#39;default&#39; flow there) if your environment is mostly Windows already. We do this for one of our products, in fact.The post meanwhile seems to be part about open source policy (nasty, but not a technical issue - also including a new-to-me and hard to find on a Google or DDG search fact about the VS gallery endpoints having led to legal threats), part issues induced by &#39;weird&#39; modern languages not caring to support Windows (as expected?), part Git for Windows not bothering to handle symbolic links cleanly (and the weird admin-only default thing that remained from Vista), and part... concerns where if people would spread the proper way of doing stuff (curl.exe bundled by default for downloads, or long file names being &#39;weird&#39; - albeit less broken than claimed here) instead of just ranting this&#39;d be fine too... but not really a coherent whole."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Only if you want to be trendchasing rather than letting backwards compatibility take care of itself...I&#39;m a native Win32 developer, have been one for a few decades, and know quite a few others still using MSVC6 because it&#39;s fast and enough for what they do. Takes &lt;250MB of disk space, and the self-contained binaries it generates will work on any version of Windows starting at Win95.Long file paths: Azure, OpenSearch, and ~90 other open source projects have to document how to enable long file paths on Windows because the default is a ~255 character limit.Personally, I think 260 is long enough and plenty to work with, while at the same time discouraging the ridiculous verboseness that seems to have crept into &#34;modern&#34; software. Then again, I stay away from .NET, VSCode, and the like. I am reminded of this post by Raymond Chen:https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/20070301-00/?p=27..."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Highly complex, in-depth, system simulation is like a siren song for game developers and players alike.There&#39;s this perception that an amazing simulation will be the basis for an amazing game.In practice, high-quality simulations seem to be interesting but not all that fun. See: F.E.A.R.&#39;s Goal-Oriented Action Planning (https://alumni.media.mit.edu/~jorkin/goap.html) which had to be modified to broadcast its intent to the player, because play-testers felt the game was unfair and that the A.I. was cheating.And it also seems like players can&#39;t really tell the difference between a sophisticated simulation and a handful of heuristics with some calls to random() thrown in. From the perspective of a player who does not know how the simulation works, the latter can _seem_ like the output of a complex system. See: _Designing Games_ by Tynan Sylvester, developer of RimWorld (https://tynansylvester.com/book/).Dwarf Fortress, I think, is the exception which proves this rule.Anyway, I think simulations like this are really cool to build, but hard to turn into a fun game."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Hi! I’m the developer of Citybound.I’m happily surprised to find this on HN again.The project is currently on a hiatus because I’m focusing on building a startup, but Citybound is an will always be my 100% passion and “anything goes” research project.I’m not on a computer today, but I will try to get back to everyone who posted in this thread.If you have any other questions about the project or the tech please just reply to this!(Side note: the main way I built a wonderful community for Citybound was to directly reply to each and every comment whenever it got interest somewhere - a tactic I can highly recommend)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Im working on a game in the same vein: Archapolis, a city builder with real time traffic simulation and interior views of your citizens homes (which you can customize/build yourself if you want), so you can watch them live their lives. I&#39;d like the player to have a more hands on approach to managing the city as well.Here&#39;s a tech demo of what I&#39;ve been working on: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7q0l87hwmkII created a path finding algorithm that can simultaneously path hundreds of thousands of units to random destinations at a comfortable frame rate (or around 100-200K like in the video using one CPU core). Units can choose from any of the shortest paths between two points (there are many in a grid), and from those paths, can also choose the path that matches any preferences they have.Very early stages of development still!"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"It&#39;s a self-correcting equilibrium though, since the block difficulty is tied to the hashrate, which will fall as miners pull out.That said, the hashrate is not showing major drops yet:https://www.blockchain.com/charts/hash-rate"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"There is a serious problem that is not much discussed. Bitcoin is susceptible to a 51% hash rate double-spend attack. As Bitcoin has grown, this has never been a practical issue. No miner or consortium has had that much hash-rate compared to the rest of the market.But when the hashrate drops below 50% of its previous maximum, that means that there are idle mining resources enough to carry out the attack. And owners of those resources may not mind throwing the whole Bitcoin system into chaos if they can get one last big payday.The lower the active hashrate grows, the smaller the consortium required to make an attack.So watch for chain forks and double-spend attacks. Maybe not this month or this year, but my expectation is it will be part of the eventual Bitcoin downward spiral."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"What many people don&#39;t realize is that the operational and customer service costs of payments don&#39;t scale with payment amount. Customers will cost almost just as frequently dispute, have questions, have problems, ask for help, attempt to defraud etc with a $1 transaction as they will a $100 or $1000 transaction. This is the real killer with micro payment schemes. Customer service costs scale more with number of payments than payment volume.  And these real costs are born by Patreon, by the networks and by the banks which is why min txn costs exist. The crypto bros totally miss the point in understanding this too.Source: 25yrs experience building payment networks"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"What I think is something people easily overlook with Patreon and similar platforms is that it&#39;s quite hard to make a decent profit on $1 or $5 transactions that most of Patreon&#39;s income seems to come from.They&#39;re definitely overcharging for more profit, but your margins won&#39;t be much lower if you handle payment yourself. Your 3% bank cut to receive money doesn&#39;t always work because often there&#39;s a minimum fee per transaction.I know most iDeal (Dutch payment provider) transaction costs are 25 cents. It&#39;s a flat fee, so buying a €2000 TV will still leave you with 25 cents of fees, which is great for big stores, but when you use them do donate a single euro, the transaction fees are a whole quarter of the donation.Tons of tiny transactions is a pretty terrible way to receive money. It&#39;s not &#34;give up &gt;15%&#34; terrible, especially if your patrons tend to donate more, but Patreon needs to spread costs over all creators to make small content creators worth the effort.Having a look at Donorbox, the same issue becomes clear: the cost for receiving payment in .NL is only 1.4%… and a €0,25 payment processor fee. These low processing fees are also only applicable to registered non profits in the NL which the author most definitely isn&#39;t. Even with the extra cheap rates and a non profit the fees to the lowest tier (±€3) add up to nearly 10% on a platform that&#39;s built around minimising costs for non profit organisations. There is the ability to use bank transfers for real cheap, but that&#39;s always a possibility anyway. One thing this site does seem to offer is the ability to offload all the site&#39;s cost onto the person who donates rather than subtract it afterwards, but that&#39;s just raising the donation price to compensate, not really a decrease in cost."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Patreon is a business and I don&#39;t begrudge them the ability to charge customers for their service (though I think it&#39;s pretty buggy). Before Patreon, I did not subscribe to a single podcast. After Patreon, I subscribe to 3-5 at various times. I subscribe to a couple other standalone products but the bar is certainly higher as the value they must provide is greater to get over having another subscription on another platform.So I think Patreon likely does help individuals get business, even if they aren&#39;t out advertising on your behalf. That said, I agree the fee does seem high, given it is largely payment processing (and a simple media player) and we know what Stripe charges for that. I think they will probably be at risk from higher quality entrants like Substack who is moving into podcasting as well."</p>

Epitome of &#34;show, don&#39;t tell.&#34; Hard to overstate what an impact it had on the company at the time (I think we were about 25 employees).[0]: https://avc.com/2010/08/how-to-pitch-a-product/"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Not an answer to OP, but I just wanted to say thank you for this thread (and everyone for answering).I&#39;ve been insanely burnt out by random bullshit at work, wondering why I&#39;m even in this business to begin with, and after watching a few of these it really motivated me, brought back the old memories of wanting to build cool stuff and ideas to solve real problems (a lot of the ideas that I still hold onto), and made me realize that I&#39;m unhappy with work because all I was doing was just people bullshit and bureaucracy bullshit every day, and not actually out there, building stuff; that I just became &#34;yet another white collar worker&#34; and not a hacker and an engineer.And that has allowed to see what went wrong, and plan for how to get out of this &#34;ditch of boring, stressful politics and human pit&#34;.Seriously, thank you.

								<p class="story__comment_others">"You might get some inspiration from Bret Victor’s videos/demos: http://worrydream.com/Personally I do not remember ever having the experience you describe, but that’s probably because in my formative years videos mostly didn’t exist yet on the internet, and I learned new tools from reading books, software documentation, forums and blog posts. And once you’ve reached a certain experience level, it becomes much more difficult to get your mind blown by some new tool, because the ideas usually have all been there in some form already, and you also see the limitations and possible drawbacks more quickly."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Lots of other comments around the dubious legality of this, at least in the US.I&#39;d like to comment, though, on the fact that the majority of these jobs are in the crypto/defi space. I&#39;m also not alone in commenting on this, and this fact alone is obviously not surprising, but I&#39;d like to point out that the central idea of crypto that you can somehow &#34;escape the government&#39;s control of finance&#34; by using crypto is as much of a fever dream as that you can feasibly work anonymously for a company.At the end of the day, the vast majority of people need the services of society and government to function. Crypto advocates have long crowed &#34;look how great it is that we have gotten monetary supply out of the control of government&#34;, but you only need to look at the current environment to see how ridiculous this is. At the end of the day people expect to be able to exchange money for goods, and not go to jail for doing so, and that is something government&#39;s aren&#39;t willing to give up, regardless of the medium of exchange.As it related to this case, the biggest question folks have is &#34;what benefit to I get for working for a company pseudonymously&#34;. On reflection it&#39;s largely downside for the vast majority of people unless you are an anti-government absolutist, or are working in something like the drug trade or a hit man that is shady to begin with."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Honestly I&#39;d rather a battery that&#39;s super reliable and NOT using any lithium ion inside it in my home.As it doesn&#39;t need to move, it can sit there in an unused space and be really heavy. Lead Acid Batteries are a very good fit here (traditionally used as the 12V battery in cars).In Australia you can buy a 12V 42AH (amp-hour) battery for ~$150AUD or $100USD.
20 of these will give you 10kWh @ 240VDC.Couple this with a 6kW solar system and you&#39;d be almost entirely free from grid electricity, especially in summer.You can individually test out the batteries and swap out bad ones. The batteries themselves typically last &gt;5years in a car and I imagine much longer at home where they aren&#39;t exposed to high engine temps and large continuous current discharges (engine cranking on start up)."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"It&#39;s unclear, but if this is Toyota&#39;s proven NiMH technology from the Prius, rather than Lithium technology (i.e. in the Tesla Powerwall), I&#39;d personally opt for this.It will last longer, and is a lot safer. Unlike Lithium, NiMH is not particularly unstable at high temperatures or flammable. And Prius batteries have been proven to last more than 20 years (at reduced capacity) without any safety problems -- we don&#39;t ever see Prius&#39; catching fire."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;m just happy to see more competition in this space. More competition will drive down costs and increase innovation. Give me 20 companies all trying to sell me the perfect solution for my home, please!When we reach a day that most homes have a basic battery like this in them to balance their power draw, power sources like wind and solar- which have variable output- become increasingly more economically viable. Oh, you can only produce when it&#39;s sunny/windy? That&#39;s fine, half the homes in the country are willing to pay you for energy right now and then use it later when it&#39;s not.What I&#39;d love to see next: larger units for condo/apartment buildings. Put a massive battery pack on the roof, or next to the parking garage. Because of the shared draw, there would be a very consistent daily pattern of use, and you could right-size the battery to ensure maximum utility of it."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Reminds me of this company: https://www.blueheartenergy.com/The claims are pretty amazing. High efficiency, efficient over a wide range of temperature difference, high temperature differences possible.The operating principle is totally different. It is based on acoustic waves. Not using phase-changes but just the ideal gas law (pressure and temperature are proportional). I tried to get my head around it, and I got it with a standing sound wave. But they use a traveling wave, for which I could not find explanations I understood.The general idea is &#34;lower air pressure and move gas to cold side so the gas heats up&#34; followed by &#34;raise air pressure and move gas to warm side so the gas cools down&#34;. That means the low pressure needs to be low enough that the gas gets colder than the cold side, and the high pressure needs to be high enough that the gas gets hotter than the hot side. Luckily that is &#39;just&#39; a matter of amplitude of the sound wave. I think this is how they achieve their wide range of efficient temperature deltas.That wide range is the main difference with a phase-change based unit. The phase change happens at a much more difficult to change temperature."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"There is plenty of opportunity in being more efficient.  To give an example, houses in the Bay Area has gray/black roofs.  In the summer such roof receives about 10kW of energy and readily converts it into heat.  Heat, which we are trying to evacuate from the house with our super-efficient heat pumps in the air-conditioning units.If only we&#39;d painted these roofs with white reflective roof paint (~92% reflection).  We would have removed ~8kW of heating from such roofs!  And then, maybe, we wouldn&#39;t  have to pump all that energy into air-conditioning.  So the surrounding air would be cooler, less noise would be heard from air conditioning, less energy would be spent.   And the cost?  4 gallons of white reflective paint and a couple of hours of work, painting the roof..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"“Lennox International… developed the first prototype that achieved the Technology Challenge’s standards about a year ahead of schedule. The prototype delivers 100% heating at 5°F at double the efficiency, and 70% to 80% heating at -5°F and -10°F.”The release goes on to say they expect commercialization and deployment in 2024."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;ve been listening to the audiobook of the Silmarillion while on a run or doing chores. At first I thought &#34;this has to be the worst idea&#34; since I found myself going back constantly and re-listening to bits to find out who was being referenced in some long description or I&#39;d lose track of what happened entirely.However, I&#39;ve since decided that this must be the best way to enjoy all the little detail. Each re-listen I&#39;ve understood more and more. It&#39;s a strange way to enjoy the work but I honestly think the creation myth at the beginning is really well written and had I just read the book I may have read it the once, retained some of it, referred back to it maybe, and moved on to the rest of the tale.Slow going but commenting just because you may enjoy this too if you&#39;ve made it to this thread. I haven&#39;t read the rest of the books since I was a kid so priming myself thoroughly for the re-read with Silmarillion first seems like it&#39;s going to have a nice payoff as rich as the world is."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"So, if the author was fired for the reasons they believe, that&#39;s pretty bad behavior. But if he had not been fired, what was management supposed to have done about the cult members working for this department?Yes, the cult&#39;s leader sounds like a pretty awful person, but he wasn&#39;t working there. What were the cult members doing in their work in the department that was clearly wrong? It&#39;s suggested that there was favoritism and unfair promotion going on -- but it&#39;s not very well evidenced here. Were they using company money to fund their organization? It&#39;s also not clear from the article that the wine outfit is a cult subsidiary.And if the concern is primarily that the cult itself is a shady organization with some bad people, and that something should be done to stop Google from having a clique of staff that are even _affiliated_ with that organization ... well that seems like a really fraught policy. Are you supposed to then ask everyone in the department about their religious affiliations, or whether they&#39;ve given money to a fringe religious organization? That also seems like a really unhealthy road for a company to go down."</p>

I&#39;ve had teams where majority of the team is from the same university or class. More than 50% of the team having a common denominator is common and it usually starts with one person getting hired in a high enough position where their hiring decisions are not scrutinized."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The number of amino-acids found has been mentioned in many on-line media, but it is completely meaningless.There exists a huge number of amino-acids, most of them are not made or used by the known living beings and of those made by living beings even fewer are used in proteins.A very large number of random amino-acids have also been found in various meteorites, because they easily form from the most abundant chemical elements in the Universe, H, C, N and O, whenever there is not enough oxygen to oxidize everything else, but among them only about 10 of those used by living beings have been found, i.e. about one half of the amino-acids used in proteins.What would have been interesting to know about the Japanese asteroid probe would have been if, among the many amino-acids found, there have been also the same about 10 amino-acids previously found, or only a part of them, and if there has been found any other amino-acid with biological importance besides those ten.The press release mentions only glutamic acid and valine, 2 simple amino-acids which belong to those 10 about which it is well known that they can easily be synthesized in abiotic conditions."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"They cooked a sample of Ryuguu and drove off about 15% of its mass,  mostly in the form of H2O and CO2.  That is,  Ryuguu is wetter and more carbon rich than the earth.Iron, Silicon and Aluminum are there in abundance. (Gerard K. O&#39;Neill and many science fiction writers have gotten wrong the idea that you need M-type asteroids to get iron.)  Astronauts found high quality hematite ore on the moon.If you wanted to make large solar sails (say to be a sunshade the Earth-Sun L1 point) you would probably de-volatilize materials by using heat and possibly oxygen.  It would be ideal to convert hydrocarbons to carbon monoxide so you can do C1 chemistry to make plastics.  You have waste CO2 no matter what (it offgases from carbonates and other chemistry) so you will need the same kind of chemistry people are talking about for capturing CO2 and using it as a chemical feedstock.The &#34;metal line&#34; and &#34;stone lines&#34; would reduce the devolatized rock to produce silicon solar cells,  electric connections,   mirrors,  etc.  You will make storage tanks from iron,  the devolatilization process could be a little awkward because you will need storage tanks to put the gate.The one resource I&#39;m not sure about is nitrogen, which is important for making chemistry work.  (Say you want to make a sail out of Kapton instead of Polyethylene.)"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Funnily in linux we&#39;ve had kind of the opposite problem where dmcrypt at some point was changed to use high-priority, multi-threaded workqueues, creating a priority inversion situation.Regular userspace processes, even those with niced/lowered priority, could generate overwhelming amounts of CPU load just by creating a bunch of IO burden on a dmcrypt-backed mountpoint.  Far more than their fair share in terms of their own process scheduling.The effects of this were especially visible when listening to mp3 files on something like a core2duo (or older) machine.  Audio buffer underruns galore, just because you had a big git checkout or rsync running.It took me years to convince upstream to revert the responsible dmcrypt workqueue commit and fix this."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"IMHO, low priority io throttle has been just about horrible in every way since it was introduced.You can tell when it was introduced if you google for things like &#34;time machine got super slow for no reason&#34; and see when they start occurring en masse.It has a strong habit, even on 100% completely idle machines, of slowing down throughput by 10x."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Looks like a thorough analysis, but I question the use of &#34;bs=1m&#34;.  Author says they verified that &#34;dd was correctly only using a one meg buffer&#34;, but &#34;bs&#34; is more than just a buffer, it&#39;s the &#34;count&#34; that read()s are issued in.  As in &#34;read(fd, 1000000);&#34; for the syscall.I don&#39;t know about MacOS, but in the distant past I found that using larger &#34;bs&#34; values tended to cause my Linux machines to behave sluggishly, particularly when interacting with very slow media like USB sticks or SD cards.  I tend to use &#34;bs=32k&#34; at the largest because it offers good performance while also limiting sluggishness.  Using too small a value limits throughput because you spend so much time issuing read() calls and looping.I&#39;m sure the author isn&#39;t going to set up that environment again just to run a test, but it would be interesting to know if a smaller bs value would have had any change in this environment."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Yep. On a related note, when I was younger, I searched for advice from experts for how to develop expertise in studying and productivity on Reddit. It led to lots of highly-upvoted advice (including stuff like supplements, largely with few real benefits besides placebo), popular blogs by influencers (like Scott Young), and popular self-help books.However, the actual experts I knew in high school who later went on to great institutions like MIT or applied and got into extremely competitive investment banks didn&#39;t browse the internet very much, or relied on supplements and these books.Similar to the ideas expressed in the submitted article, these people didn&#39;t spend time online reading blogs and Reddit, or blogging/self-promoting themselves. They generally were involved in a sport (track and field or squash), spent little time online, and spent a lot of time using a lot of paper studying.They also were careful who they associated with as friends (they hung out with studious people). Less in one&#39;s control, their parents were financially successful or were in competitive positions (e.g. were professors or physicians), so they may have learned these strategies from them, versus inventing them independently.Long story short: there is absolutely a culture of improvement that is primarily offline and less visible, because people either don&#39;t record it, or people do record it and it doesn&#39;t get upvoted or ranked highly on Google searches. Examples of recorded good advice appeared on HN recently, shared by computer scientist Donald Knuth who is also usually offline: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=31482116"</p>

So many articles and comments by people whose level of enthusiasm doesn&#39;t match their experience.  Try to voice a comment that goes against the flow of that enthusiasm and you&#39;ll be downvoted to oblivion, even if you speak with more experience and context than the masses.  I&#39;m horrified by some of the stuff I see here and feel like it&#39;s often useless to speak out."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; Yes, there are many people who blog and otherwise publicly discuss development methodologies and what they&#39;re working on, but there are even more people who don&#39;t. Blogging takes time, for example, and not everyone enjoys it. Other people are working on commercial products and can&#39;t divulge the inner workings of their code.There’s a subset of this silent majority who tried to contribute to discussion platforms but gave up when they saw prominent voices that had next to no idea what they were talking about being promoted, hailed, and so on. The loudest voice is rarely the most articulate, and for subject matter experts articulation, nuance, and other learned-through-experience things count for a lot, one would assume."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"In addition to the project itself being very cool and useful (you can count the number of verified SAT solvers that can solve most problems in modern SAT competitions on two fingers!), it&#39;s also an impressive demonstration of its toolchain, which essentially exploits the fact that the purely safe fragment of Rust (augmented with a handful of types that use unsafe code like Vec, which I believe have been proven compatible with the rest of Creusot in another recent paper) behaves like a functional language.  This allows borrow-checked Rust code to be treated purely functionally in safe contexts, which allows exploiting the large amount of existing software tailored to proving purely functional specifications, without having to worry about memory-related side conditions, separation logic, etc.This has always been the hope for Rust verification tools (that Rust would scale to these kinds of large proofs better than other industrial imperative languages due to the restrictions of the borrow checker), and I think this is the first real practical indication that that is indeed the case.  Both in terms of verification time and additional verification code, it weighs in at a small fraction of that of the only other verified solver with comparable performance on SAT benchmarks (IsaSAT), which is extracted using code generation from Isabelle (which is a full proof assistant), while other attempts to produce verified SAT solvers directly from imperative code fall far short of its performance because they do not implement any of the difficult optimizations (presumably due to the amount of extra proof effort required).Incidentally, another paper has come out at basically the same time making a similar observation, Aeneas: https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.07185, which uses a resizable hash map as its case study.  Since it just came out, it does not have any larger proof developments yet that could be used as comparison, and it has somewhat different goals, but overall I am also excited about it and am very hopeful for the future of verification tools that integrate directly with Rust code like these two, as I think they are one of the more promising avenues towards the regular integration of verified code with more &#34;ordinary&#34; projects."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This project uses one-way translation of Rust code into WhyML through Creusot. This translation is not formally guaranteed to be correct or semantics-preserving.Ideally, the code produced by Creusot should be translated back to Rust by a tool from Creusot or someone else. This way it is possible to use fixed point iteration, just like AST pretty-printer and parser for programming language syntax.This is more or less an approach taken by verification team of Buran (USSR&#39;s space shuttle) software. They took Fortran code and compiled it into executable code. The executable code was then manually translated back into Fortran and discrepancies analyzed. This way they found several errors in Fortran compiler. Buran made fully automatic landing in late 80-s.Contemporary verifiers should do the same automatically."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Hi! I’m the author of Creusot, Sarek did some amazing work on CreuSAT, he also had to teach himself formal verification and SAT solving along the way.If you have any questions about CreuSAT or Creusot, I’d be happy to answer"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&gt; Amazon founder and former CEO Jeff Bezos saw his warehouse workforce as necessary but replaceable, and feared that workers who remained at the company too long would turn complacent or, worse, disgruntled, according to reporting by the New York Times.Wow.  Think about what this is really saying: Amazon adopts the explicit policy of not wanting their workers to stay on long enough to figure out that they are getting a bad deal.So it&#39;s not that they are running out of people to hire, it&#39;s that they are running out of people who have not yet figured out that working for Amazon is a bad deal.Now I understand why I&#39;ve been seeing so many commercials lately about how great it is to work for Amazon."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I think this article might bury the lede a bit:&gt;Walmart is offering some workers with past warehouse experience as much as $25 an hour. An Amazon executive told Reuters in late 2021 that the company was bumping the average starting wage for new hires in the US to more than $18 an hour, attributing the decision to intense competition among employers.People used to work for Amazon warehouses in the 2010s because $15/hr was a much better wage than they could find elsewhere in their geographic location.After the pandemic and ongoing inflation, it&#39;s not difficult to find easier work which pays better. Amazon responded with a token raise that doesn&#39;t even cover CoL adjustments, but history shows that they need to pay well above market rates to hire the quantity of people that they need.It&#39;s funny to see this dynamic at a time when the federal minimum wage is still stuck at $7.25/hr."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is a very predictable consequence of criticizing your employer via a public letter. Criticize internally all you want, and influence the changes that you want to see happen. Employment is a two-way relationship. If you don&#39;t like your employer, you are free to leave. If they don&#39;t like you, they are free to fire you (within legal bounds). Publishing an openly critical letter and signing it is a quick way to get your employer to not like you."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Here&#39;s my unpopular opinion - good riddance. It&#39;s not a free speech issue because SpaceX isn&#39;t a public square. It&#39;s a company, and companies are top down. If these employees are at Musk&#39;s company, then they had better be prepared to play by Musk&#39;s rules, and they did the exact opposite, essentially leading a mutiny against the boss and sowing discord within the company in the process. SpaceX isn&#39;t an activist organization and has no obligation to kowtow to the demands of internal activists. Not all companies are like this, but again, you should know what you&#39;re signing up for when you join a Musk company.And I&#39;d also be willing to bet cash that all these employees were very low level, likely new hires out of college, and are all of the political activist type. Because for all his bluster, Musk really hasn&#39;t done anything THAT objectionable besides openly shit on Democrats. (No, I don&#39;t believe the bogus sexual assault allegation from an anonymous friend of a friend, there&#39;s no evidence)."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I&#39;m a sucker for good little microinteractions. The author&#39;s checkbox may not be one of those, as it seems a bit overdone, but I&#39;d have to try it to be sure. It&#39;s easy to go too far.But, some other examples that I love:• https://www.joshwcomeau.com/animation/3d-button The red &#34;push me&#34; button is great, but also check out the sun/moon icon near the top right!• https://www.jam3.com/#contact The hover states on the buttons.• https://citymapper.com The top-left hamburger icon.(I also happen to be quite proud of the hover states on my own site: https://jonathanalland.com/)Making this type of stuff is definitely what I miss most about working in web design."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The animations on things like this can be cute and fun the first time, but man they can get annoying if they&#39;re constant and can&#39;t be skipped. Hearthstone is an example of this; there&#39;s tons of cute animations for the various cards, but they can take way too long.Hiding &#34;no animations&#34; for power users under accessibility is a great way to go."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"It&#39;s pretty cool! As experiments I really love andy.works&#39; work. I appreciate what he&#39;s trying to accomplish. And I think he&#39;s on to something with the idea. But the execution is always a little off to me.I just don&#39;t find this checkbox all that satisfying. Why? The thing I find satisfying about checkboxes is the same as any switch – the click. On/off. It&#39;s snappy. I don&#39;t think about it. Click... click... click click!So this grandiose check animation is taking something inherently snappy and prolonging it to its own defeat. Even the sound effect is like an ethereal chime or something, rather than a snap. The scale is super big for the actual space of the phone. The animation too long. I also don&#39;t like the angle of the 3D checkmark itself. It&#39;s not really oblique, not really at any sort of satisfying geometric angle? I can live with that though.Anyway really cool work. Wish it were more satisfying."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Hello, author here! As the website says, the compiler itself is still in a very early state where basic things like functions, types, traits, inference, monomorphisation, and codegen are implemented. The fun stuff of algebraic effects, lifetime inference, and refinement types are not however. Though I can elaborate on implementation strategies of these for anyone curious. For example, algebraic effects in existing languages can be quite slow at runtime due to the use of continuations, the translation to a monad stack, and/or dynamically finding handlers at runtime. It is my plan to monomorphise them away and inline all these cases as in the following paper (1). With this, handlers are inlined into functions, continuations are normal closures, and continuations that aren&#39;t called multiple times are inlined.(1) Zero-cost Effect Handlers by Staging:

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I avidly follow descendants of Scheme and Haskell (I figured out for example how to build Idris native on an M1 Mac), and I plan to follow Ante. I just spent $5k of lunch money on an M1 Ultra Mac Studio, to use as a math compute server. How do I keep it busy? Haskell. My &#34;Hello world&#34; parallel benchmark, using reverse search to enumerate the 66,960,965,307 atomic lattices on six atoms, took 14 hours in 2009. It now takes four minutes.I&#39;d love to start again with a new, small language. I love Haskell, but it&#39;s decades old, and one struggles to work with it without being torn apart by the gravitational tides of the black hole at the center of its galaxy. All jokes aside, Haskell really does reward a PhD in category theory, or the self-taught equivalent later.Functional languages make parallelism easier, and Haskell has put particular effort into this: Adding a dozen lines to a program can keep the 16 performance cores of my Mac Studio running full tilt. I have yet to read any account of how someone else&#39;s favorite language makes parallelism easy, that is aware of the comparison with Haskell. If I thought there was a reasonable alternative, I&#39;d jump at trying it.Rust appeals because it replaces GC with modern control of allocation lifetimes. I love how Ante will also explore this. I use cyclic data structures; how one handles this functionally, and how one handles this using reference counting, is exactly the same problem.Parallelism should be the first consideration, designing any new language in 2022. Parallelism is the reason I keep using Haskell, despite newer alternatives. Any language that runs on a single core is a toy. This is a plea!"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The syntax looks a little funky to me but it&#39;s still quite interesting. Is there a reason why you would make fn(1) and fn 1 equivalent? For me personally it makes readability worse and looks strange when chaining functions like in their last example on their landing page.On mobile horizontal scrolling through the code snippets will trigger switching to the next snippet on my phone."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"After a rather dismal first couple of runs I read the blog post for some hints. The best I found was to try to raise rates during the good times so there is wiggle room during downturns. I was able to get 443,904 by raising to over 10% during the initial prosperity period and was able to cut rates in half as soon as there was a crash. Ultimately I stabilized at around 3.5%. As of the time of this post I think that is the highest or close to highest score, only slightly higher than those that did a constant -0.5%.I’ve always been apprehensive of how low interest rates dropped around 9/11 and nobody had the political courage to raise them after that, leaving little room for leverage. What I have learned from racing games is that in order to win, it’s not all about holding down the gas pedal the hardest. Its about keeping on the track first, which requires lower speeds to navigate complexity, and only using max speed in straightaways.Or to quote the eminent Charlie Sheen, right after his infamous ’banging 7 gram rocks’ he said, “I only have one speed, I only have one gear: GO.” History tells how well that worked out.That may work on a straightaway, but in this world, there’s people and there’s pandemics and wars and politics. Had rates been at a higher level they could have been slashed at the start of the pandemic, but there was no room to drop at that point."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The biggest problem with GNOME right now is Gtk3 and gtkfilechooserwidget.c. It is so spaghetti and so many things rely on it that no one at GNOME is willing to work on it for fear of breaking something. And for the same reason they won&#39;t accept drive-by patches. It is, effectively, frozen broken, and has been for many years. This applies to any attempt to add thumbnails to the file chooser but there are far worse, actual bugs, beyond the lack of thumbnails.As of right now if you File-&gt;Open in any program using modern Gtk3 and try to paste a file path in you&#39;ll get an error instead of pasting your filepath in a text field to open, &#34;The folder contents could not be displayed\nOperation not supported&#34; http://erewhon.superkuh.com/gtkfilechooserwidget-paste-fail....It&#39;s unfixable behavior because the GNOME devs stopped respecting their own gsettings, org.gtk.Settings.FileChooser location-mode, to FORCE the path-bar experience on everyone. Because no one needs to type file paths, apparently. So why bother respecting the settings for path-bar or filename-entry? Their demographic doesn&#39;t care. Unfortunately gtk3 is used by far more than GNOME&#39;s demographic.They have fixed this bug in gtk4, for all the good that does."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"My top gtk3/gnome 30 wtfs:- the (all too well-known) file picker issue where when you type something it interprets it as file  name filter rather than, you know, the file name you want to save under- missing top menu (but a bar is still there wasting space for a ... clock wtf)- general window positioning; like, if you open an app, rather than just opening a window as new top window, gnome opens it behind others and pushes a notification &#34;FF is ready&#34; wtf- mainstream desktop apps not ported to dark mode, so those icons look even more puzzlingI could go on, but I&#39;m definitely leaving gnome/gtk apps behind. I&#39;ve eyed KDE Plasma which could give me everything I ever wanted from a DE, but I was using Ubuntu/gnome because it was mainstream enough that everything just works OOTB. I&#39;m also totally not looking forward to wayland, containerize-all-the-things such that basic file workflows stop working, and other attitudes, all the while the apps I&#39;m using are exactly the same I&#39;ve used 15 or 20 years ago, without new ones coming.I think I&#39;m going back to Mac."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"In the past 5 years I&#39;ve seen maybe a dozen &#34;how elliptic curves work&#34;, but this is the first to actually illustrate how they work on a small field. I think that&#39;s key to understanding, seeing it in a small enough field that you can literally see all of the points. Nicely done.If you want to keep going, as an advanced beginner I&#39;d like to see:Arbitrary bigint math - how do you do Exp/Sqrt with arbitrary sized ints? (I&#39;m familiar with two crypto libs that do this, and MPIs &amp; branches confuse me).Second: why is C25519 faster than SecP256R1 or BrainPool? maybe some insight there? (Isn&#39;t Ed25519 the signature name? and X25519 the ECDH name?)Greedy of me, but thanks!"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"My broken record take on this stuff is that whatever value there is in visualizing elliptic curves, there&#39;s more intuition to build just by playing with the curve formulae directly (it&#39;s pretty basic math) and seeing how the operations work in code. I don&#39;t have the math background to back this up but my understanding of the group rules is that they&#39;re --- at least for the application we&#39;re using them in --- a little arbitrary."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Brex founder here.We&#39;ve made the difficult decision to no longer offer services to the small business market.Back in April we launched Empower, and we decided to put the full weight of Brex towards building the best global payments platform for tech startups and larger companies. With that, we realized we couldn&#39;t do a great job serving the small business community at the same time. This has been an incredibly difficult decision for me and the team, but we believe small businesses deserve a partner that is entirely focused on them.We know how changes in financial services can be disruptive – especially in a moment like now. We&#39;re doing all we can, and working with other financial service providers to make this transition as smooth as possible."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Why Brex is no longer qualified to be our bank:We’ve put $millions through Brex cash/cards and will almost certainly leave after reading this. This doesn’t affect us (I think?) but that they’d do something like this in this way is a breach of trust that signals bigger problems down the line. What is “Empower” and why would I believe they won’t sunset the current Brex offering to push some upmarket sales nonsense on us as it that new thing becomes the focus?We had kind of outgrown Brex anyway, but this is sad to see. What really irks me here is that I know my first company, a bootstrapped e-commerce thing that was a healthy “small business” would have been axed by this, but the current one is big enough that they wouldn’t want to lose us. Just doesn’t sit right with me.I appreciate how tough this decision probably was, but I hope they properly modeled who else they’d lose via loss of faith, like us."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Not surprised by any of this. Feels like it comes from the top, culturally.I had a terrible experience &#34;onboarding&#34; with Brex last year. They actually &#34;approved&#34; my bootstrapped startup and sent me a physical card only to rescind it a shortly thereafter, because--even though we met the funding minimum--it wasn&#39;t &#34;professionally invested&#34; on further review. Bootstrapping apparently required a $1MM minimum.Here&#39;s what they told me:&#34;While being professionally invested is not a requirement for the Brex card with monthly payments, without professional investment, the minimum cash balance requirement shown in connected accounts is $1mm. If you&#39;re able to provide proof of XXXXX&#39;s professional investment, the minimum cash balance requirement shown in connected accounts is $50k.&#34;Left a really bitter taste in my mouth. Won&#39;t ever use them.Currently banking with Mercury and love it BTW."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The announcement says it wants to &#34;protect consumers&#34;, but it changes user tracking from opt-in to opt-out... How about ensuring that companies stop tracking people unnecessarily?I see so many websites – even club websites or private blogs – that have a cookie consent banner, but which wouldn&#39;t actually need one if they&#39;d just turn off Google Analytics. I just don&#39;t get it."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"From what I understand the way this is currently shaking out, is that it largely won&#39;t impact marketplace sites as credit cards can be used as a form of age verification. You might have to create an account and associate a credit card before you&#39;re able to browse which would be an awful user experience...For other sites though, if the this passes into law I suspect it will have a much more intense cooling effect on the availability and access to sites. For the unpaid service sites I run, I&#39;m certainly not going to pay for identity verification or allow that garbage on my sites. I&#39;m much more likely to hide or disable any user generated content, or just serve a static page to users in the UK saying the site isn&#39;t available in your region.They&#39;re really doubling down on removing themselves from the world community..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"It&#39;s a bit of a shame that self-labelling by web sites never seemed to really take off:* https://www.w3.org/TR/powder-use-cases/#cpA* https://www.w3.org/2007/powder/* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protocol_for_Web_Description_R...It could be much easier if the major web browsers (at this point Chrome, Safari (mobile), Firefox) were able to read the metadata and if parents (or corporate IT departments) wanted to filter content they could using &#39;built-in&#39; technology rather every web site having to potentially re-invent the wheel."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Tauri – Electron alternative written in Rust - https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=29807022 - Jan 2022 (419 comments)(The cutoff for dupes is a year or so: https://news.ycombinator.com/newsfaq.html)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"In my curious search for lighter Electron alternatives to implement Zoho Writer&#39;s (https://writer.zoho.com) desktop app: I found Sciter[1]It supports multiplatform app development with HTML/JS/CSS and the entire engine&#39;s runtime is just about 5MB which is unbelievably small!I further analysed how this was possible, what I found was beyond fascinating.1. The author has wrote a compiler that supports JS with useful extensions like classes and fancy stuff, even before ES6 came into existence.2. He had built his own layouting engine that understands HTML and CSS 3.0Basically he&#39;s built a custom browser engine, but custom tailored for writing multi-platform apps. So it&#39;s super-fast without as much memory taxes. It&#39;s not backed by a BigCo or a huge community (I guess) and I&#39;m not sure whether I&#39;ll pick it for a business critical app. But the way it&#39;s architected seems far superior than the shortcut approaches that Electron or most other alternatives take.The project is not even new. It&#39;s more than a decade old which itself is amazing.[1] https://sciter.com"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Not to rain on the parade, but:- What&#39;s the point of mentioning Rust when the heavylifting is done by the system&#39;s webview widget, and applications are written in HTML/CSS/JS, just as in Electron?- Isn&#39;t the whole point of Electron to have version/feature stability for the browser APIs by bundling a specific Chromium runtime? Without this requirement, it was also trivial before Electron showed up to write a small native wrapper application around the system-provided webview widget."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I had LinkedIn until October 2021.A colleague was leaving, and I&#39;d been asked to go around the team of 200 people, gathering farewell greetings. Another work project at the same time was the software language translations for our product.I manually trimmed the list of 200 colleagues down to 70 &#34;international&#34; names. Then I manually searched for each colleague on Google, and clicked the first link. Usually that was Facebook or LinkedIn.I manually viewed 55 LinkedIn profiles over the course of 2 hours, and copy-pasted out only their &#34;spoken language&#34; field.LinkedIn proceeded to block my account. 
&#34;Your account has violated the LinkedIn User Agreement and Professional Community Policies. Due to the number and/or the severity of these violations, this account has been permanently restricted.&#34;Politely explaining the situation to several customer service agents [Case: 211020-004202] didn&#39;t help. Had I been warned about viewing too many profiles too quickly, I&#39;d certainly have slowed down! My actions weren&#39;t automated.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I’m the CEO of Triplebyte. I just looked into this, and we are not automatically making anyone&#39;s profile public without their consent. OP, it looks like you had set your profile to be visible some time ago (I can provide details via email but won’t here for privacy purposes), and just hadn’t gotten a message until now. The support response you received was incorrect; you weren’t affected by any recent changes to the site.Since there wasn’t anything broken on our end, there shouldn’t be anyone else impacted by this. But as part of making sure that OP wasn’t visible by mistake, I had my team double-checked to make sure our previous fix from last year was properly retroactive. It was.More generally, I don&#39;t think that tricking anyone is a viable way for us to run a business. We’re trying to create a marketplace that can open opportunities for engineers who wouldn’t otherwise have them, and we need the trust of engineers in order to do that."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I totally forgot about Triplebyte.  Are they even relevant still?  I remember back when it seemed like their ads were appearing everywhere and was a bit worried they were going to be the new way of hiring engineering talent.  Seems like there&#39;s been nothing but crickets chirping for the last few years.Why?  My experience with them was pretty bad.  I took their assessment for web development, I think I even did an assignment, and got put on a video call with someone from Triplebyte.  He never cracked a smile.  Suddenly I got asked a bunch of CS questions that really were not very relevant to web development, some of which were entirely inappropriate like sorting a binary search tree.  I even told the guy that I thought I was getting those questions wrong and he just scowled and said &#34;well you just don&#39;t know when you&#39;re going to use this stuff.&#34;  &#34;My point exactly,&#34; I thought.Ultimately I got rejected.The whole idea that you can boil down a candidate to some coding challenges and a video quiz is bad.  I do like the idea of streamlining the hiring process for developers, but there&#39;s more to it than knowing a bunch of stuff, because that can be gamed.  And quizzing me on irrelevant material was a bad move.  A firm like Triplebyte won&#39;t be as good at interviewing a candidate as the employer itself, and may even keep perfectly qualified candidates out of view from all employers affiliated with them."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I went through their process, passed in their top cohort (or so they told me, probably it was to massage my ego). And then they dropped that public profile bomb the first time around.I’d say I cost them a lot of money when I deleted my account, but they actually cost it themselves.They could have asked me if I wanted a fancy jacket, because that ended up immediately getting recycled. The book was dece thoAnyways, I ended up getting a job that I love the old fashioned way - through a friend.Great concept, shit company.Edit: Triplebyte employees reading this: you massively betrayed my trust. Had you asked me, and let me review on my own time, I might have even been proud to have a verified skill set badge page I could link to. Instead, I will probably look directly for your competitors on my next job search. You had a great idea, too bad that you seem to be irresponsible."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">".NET is the most open, non-trivial ecosystem I have ever participated in.I experienced 2 different problems with .NET (back in 2.x/3.x days), and was able to have interaction with the actual MS developers on their Github issue page without any sort of bullshit overhead process.Within days, I saw traction on my comments and within months I saw PRs that ultimately resolved the issue I presented. The following year, I was deploying framework code to my customers&#39; instances which incorporated fixes to my concerns.Perhaps I am unaware of just how much better it is with the other ecosystems, but for me this is enough interaction with my framework vendor.Are we upset that we have to pay money for the privilege of using other peoples&#39; intellectual property? Or are we asserting that Microsoft is stealing other peoples&#39; IP? I am trying to find the actual crime here."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is exactly the same as what MS did for the Python extension when the open-source LSP was replaced by the proprietary Pylance. I get the feeling that MS becomes more and more likes Google. For example, on Android, the core experience is provided by GMS while the AOSP is provided as an open-source core. In terms of VSCode, the core editor is free and open-source, but some key experience is baked by proprietary components (e.g., Remote plugins, Pylance, etc.). And the trending is that more and more plugins which are controlled by MS are moving towards to a mixture of open-source code and proprietary components."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This sort of thing has been MS&#39;s playbook since I was a kid, or earlier.  It surprises me that people are still surprised when things like this happen.  I especially think someone with Miguel de Icaza&#39;s experience should know better[0].It&#39;s interesting to see the generational difference here. Many of my somewhat-younger (even only by 7-10 years) programmer/techie friends just don&#39;t remember the Microsoft of the 80s and 90s, and see all the &#34;good&#34; they&#39;ve been doing with the open source community in more recent times, and think MS is a pretty good corporate citizen in the tech world.But in reality, MS has just done a great job whitewashing their image[1] in the past 15 years, especially in the past 8 years since Ballmer stepped down and Nadella took the reins. I do believe they&#39;re a better, less anti-competitive company than they used to be. But they&#39;re still the same company in many ways. I think a big part of their &#34;play nice&#34; strategy was born out of necessity, since they heavily dropped the ball in the late 90s/early 00s when the internet/WWW was really coming into its own, and then again in the early/mid 10s when Windows Phone failed miserably. They just lost the clout to do the anti-competitive bullshit they used to pull. But the desire to do all this stuff is still there.[0] It was clear to me that MS intended .NET to be a wholly-proprietary, Windows-only technology until de Icaza and co. built Mono, when MS grudgingly embraced it.  This proprietary extension feels like their standard follow-on of &#34;extend and extinguish&#34;, though it&#39;s coming a bit later than we&#39;d expect.[1] Bill Gates has also done an amazing job rehabilitating his image through philanthropy.  A lot of people forget how his actions at MS probably held back progress in the computing industry for at least a decade (or two?), through forced lock-in and anti-competitive behavior."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I remember the moment I realized how fast computers are at uni.   I was in an algorithms course, and one of our projects was to make a program which would read in the entire dataset from IMDB of films and actors, and calculate the shortest path between any actor and Kevin Bacon using actors and movies as nodes and roles as edges.I was working in C, and looking back I came up with a quite performant solution mostly by accident: all the memory allocated up front in a very cache-friendly way.The first time I ran the program, it finished in a couple seconds.   I was sure something must have failed, so I looked at the output to try to find the error, but to my surprise it was totally correct.   I added some debug statements to check that all the data was indeed being read, and it was working totally as expected.I think before then I had a mental model of a little person inside the CPU looking over each line of code and dutifully executing it, and that was a real eye-opener about how computers actually work."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"1. There&#39;s no real limit to how slow you can make code. So that means there can be surprising large speedups if you start from very slow code.2. But, there is a real limit to the speed of a particular piece of code. You can try finding it with a roofline model, for example. This post didn&#39;t do that. So we don&#39;t know if 201ms is good for this benchmark. It could still be very slow."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"The author makes a common statistical error in interpreting the Lindy effect. The Lindy effect proposes, simplified, that the longer something has been around, the longer it will probably stay around still. The author then makes a quick jump and posits that the opposite is also true, which it is not. Just because something has been around for a short time does not mean that its expected lifespan is somehow short. In other words, A implies B does not mean B implies A as well. All things that have been around for a long time had at one point only been around for a short time."</p>

And when I do, it&#39;s usually no more than a dozen lines at a time.I get the impression from these people that they are constantly typing things. In fact, they&#39;re typing so much that they can&#39;t possibly waste valuable seconds using a mouse. I must be misunderstanding what they mean because that just can&#39;t be right.And what&#39;s with the &#34;you can achieve the same thing faster, without breaking your concentration&#34; in regard to using a spell-checker or a calculator or whatever. Are you being serious? I can achieve the same thing faster? I mean how long do you think it takes to check the spelling of a word? Even if I must look it up in a physical dictionary, how long are we talking here?Guys, seriously, slow down. You&#39;re going to burn out. I don&#39;t want to judge because I don&#39;t know you. Maybe you&#39;re a rockstar, but I&#39;d guess that if you&#39;re really going this fast, the quality of your code is suffering."</p>

My mother is living a nightmare due to it right now as she assumed being someone&#39;s spouse would let you take responsibility for an incapacitated spouse.. wrong!My father had a stroke so debilitating that he lost language entirely, lives in a brain care unit 24/7, and has zero chance of regaining even the most basic idea of a life. But by not being biologically &#34;dead&#34; he retains a lot of legal protections that don&#39;t really suit his situation and my mother is unable to sell her home without the permission of the Court of Protection.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I started my career 2008 building real estate and stock news websites. Back then, sooooo much of my days were spent making things &#34;IE compatible&#34; using techniques like:- creating sprite sheets of transparent png corners and sides that one could arrange in a table around an element to create drop-shadows and rounded corners- putting single pixel, transparent gifs at the end of floated containers because clearfix used a &#34;before&#34; CSS selector that earlier IEs didn&#39;t know about.- writing CSS rules like  -ms-filter: &#34;progid:DXImageTransform.Microsoft.Alpha(Opacity=75)&#34;; to make something semi-transparent...And so much more. Back then, we were certain we&#39;d open a bottle of champagne once IE is not a requirement anymore.Today, fortunately, I have a different Job and Microsoft makes different browsers. But looking back, I wouldn&#39;t have believed this day to arrive."</p>

MS is serious about long-term support commitments and backwards compat!"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"There was a time in 1998-99 when Internet Explorer 4 / 5 was actually the best browser by far. Netscape 4 was unstable and had completely botched all the fancy new features: its implementation of CSS (brand new at the time) was so bad that even font sizes didn&#39;t work right, its homegrown &#34;layers&#34; API for JavaScript DOM access was awful, and many web developers were wishing they could somehow get away with only supporting IE.25 years after the release of IE4, I&#39;m just glad both of those browser codebases are now dead.IE was really done in by Microsoft&#39;s &#34;Longhorn&#34; OS project. After Windows XP, Microsoft was planning a very ambitious update that would completely reset core APIs. File systems would be largely replaced by an OS-level database, and the Win32 GUI API would be replaced by an XML-based UI framework codenamed Avalon.A new Avalon browser would ship with the OS, and thus IE + HTML would become legacy technologies as Microsoft confidently assumed most developers would flock to building their web apps in Avalon instead.To Microsoft strategists, it seemed that they had succeeded in containing the web: Netscape was dead, Mozilla had almost no users, Apple was shipping their IE in Mac OS X, Google wasn&#39;t on Microsoft&#39;s radar, and the HTML standard process was stalled. So while a lot of content was being delivered as HTML4, there didn&#39;t seem to be any reason left for Microsoft to invest in IE — they&#39;d already nailed the browser, owned the market, and would push Avalon as the next step.Fortunately, Longhorn failed. Some parts of the project eventually shipped years late as Windows Vista. Avalon became WPF + XAML and still exists in Windows, but the dream of a XAML browser replacing IE was dead."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This seems like good marketing but reading this press release and looking at the courses in their degree program I feel like I&#39;m missing what&#39;s different here (other than some reference to supply chain management).Most of the coursework here seems to be very similar to what was available over a decade ago at the state university I attended for graduate school (my concentration was semiconductor device theory related). While I think this material is very interesting I don&#39;t know that the demand is going to be there for this type of field. Companies like Intel have dedicated smaller departments for process development which do the more academic work (for example the D1X facility).My experience with fabrication organization is the need is much more process engineer and technician focused rather than semiconductor engineers. The high volume hires are in improving reliability, reducing cost etc. I don&#39;t think you really need the EE degree for this, more likely industrial engineering, chemical engineering or statistics.This said, Purdue has always had a very strong program in the more device oriented semiconductor courses (Until his passing Robert Pierret the fellow who wrote some of the best and most used grad textbooks on devices called it home)."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Ha, I&#39;m interning with their chip design team right now. They&#39;ve done 7 tapeouts but there&#39;s a lot of mistakes and other issues down in the plumbing.I wouldn&#39;t say their program is significantly better or worse than any other, and my understanding is this focus on a &#34;Semiconductor Degree&#34; is just a reshuffling of courses already offered in EE and ECE degrees. Certainly there are teams far ahead of Purdue. The programs at UCSD and OSU that are pioneering the work on OpenROAD and Skywater 130 are the ones who are really ahead of the game. If I could be at any program in the US, those are where I would want to be.That said Purdue is absolutely ahead of the average ECE program. Very few undergrad programs are completing tapeouts on a regular basis, even at schools that would otherwise have the funding to accomplish it. There are plenty of schools that think of ECE as &#34;EE plus some CS courses&#34; and don&#39;t even teach much HDL, much less how to layout a standard cell or do timing analysis."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I have fond memories of my semiconductor physics classes. The were not easy whatsoever, rather intense.As cvccvroomvroom had mentioned, I had my VLSI chip fabbed at the MOSIS facility in Westborough MA, during my EE tenure at UMASS Amherst in the 1990s as part of a state-wide chip design competition (yeah - didn&#39;t win..). There was much activity on VLSI and computer system design at that time, things have certainly changed in the US.I recall many entries were implementations of various (and obscure) mathematical algorithms, mostly in the frequency domain (hence DSP chips), that tried to solve problems that are now trivial in SW today.My school did win occasionally, others were mostly MIT and WPI - I think in a large part due to the excellent professors at all competting schools and the work ethic of the students.My final submission was the design for an Arithmetic Fourier Transform processor - trying to remove the need for expensive ROM by aliasing the signup up-frequency - which I did the barrel-based ALU for, and thank the grad students for including me in the project.cvccvroomvroom: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=31756704#31760353

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Funny article in that it doesn&#39;t discuss lifecycle costs.  A side-by-side comparison of the cost of grids powered by nuclear power plant relative to those powered by wind/solar/storage is what I&#39;d expect to see from a &#39;paper of record&#39; like the NYTimes.Except in some specific cases (Finland, other Arctic regions with long periods of low sunlight) I&#39;m pretty sure this cost comparison comes down firmly on the side of wind/solar/storage.  Storage is the main cost barrier for 100% renewable-powered grids, but this is also an area where technological development is possible.Much of the discussion of energy in the American media is pretty poor these days.  For example, the solar tariff issue on China sourced PV - there are simply no US companies making panels of comparable quality (monocrystalline Si lasts longer and is more efficient).  Concepts like requiring Chinese manufacturers to open factories in the USA if they want to sell in US markets would make sense but probably would violate some trade provision or other.Another factor that this article should have mentioned is the reliability of the global uranium ore -&gt; fuel rods supply chain.  Costs vary significantly based on the purity of the ore (18% is the top, 0.1% is the economically viable limit) and like oil, uranium ore is not globally distributed (unlike sunlight and wind).As far as Russia/Ukraine, the real agenda the US government seems to be pushing there is using that conflict to rapidly increase LNG exports to Europe from the US West/South coast, even though energy prices are spiking due to inflation (and plausibly due to exports of crude oil from the USA, allowed under that 2015 bill lifting that restriction).  A far better plan for Europe would be to go 100% renewable asap, meaning no need for fossil fuel imports from any party.  Yes, that&#39;s technologically possible, but would require massive economic investment."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"A few years ago, I went to a public interview/chat with Rainer Weiss in NYC. He described years of work in which the LIGO team found inventive ways to make their systems more precise. They just kept knocking down orders-of-magnitude. Still, after taking new measurements, they found nothing. No gravitational waves. Then the interviewer asked him if he was discouraged at this point in his career. I loved his response. He said, &#34;No, it was a more meaningful zero.&#34;"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Stagnation of scientific fields is normal and can last many years. In that time, little anomalies pile up, are swept under the rug, and largely forgotten. To admit anomalies can ruin careers, after all.Eventually someone (often very young/inexperienced) comes along and upends the field by proposing a different model or doing the experiment whose weight breaks the camels back.What&#39;s new here is the scale of the work. It&#39;s not clear how you upend a field where the price of entry is measured in billions of dollars."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Extra shoutouts to the folks at Sentry who also flipped rust-minidump on as their default backend and had to deal with way more exotic issues than I did (and fixed them!) because although Firefox sees some horrendous stuff and gets a bajillion crash reports, it&#39;s still one application with one basically stable minidump writing configuration.They have to deal with basically random apps doing whatever they want and it sounds like hell."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Thank you for this work!I&#39;ve been involved with minidumps in one way or another since around 2010. Was at a startup at the time that had a browser based on Chromium and we needed crash reporting for our own app. So I wrote a pretty simply backend that received minidumps, ran them through the breakpad processor and shoved the output into Splunk. That was our crash-reporting system.Circa 2013 the company gets acquired by Yahoo which at the time was using Crittercism for its mobile apps but Yahoo wasn&#39;t happy with it. Somehow I was now the mobile app crash reporting expert at the company though so I built a whole new in-house crash reporting solution.For iOS I wrote an SDK around PLCrashReporter because unwinding stacks on the client works out way better on iOS than dealing with a minidump.For Android I had to deal with both JVM (er, Dalvik, er ART) stack traces, easy enough, but also native code crashes. For the latter I used breakpad&#39;s crash handler and minidumps. But it turns out that minidumps from Android devices are almost useless for two reasons:1) If the crashes originate in managed code or calls into managed code you can&#39;t trace back through the managed code frames from a minidump. Especially if you don&#39;t have frame pointers.2) You basically cannot get the symbols for all the different flavors of Android. Without symbols any stack trace that breakpad reconstructs is pretty useless.Eventually I abandoned minidumps on Android and instead unwinding on the phone using corkscrew, wait no, libbacktrace, wait no, libunwind. But that still doesn&#39;t give useful stack traces very often. In the end, I ended up capturing logcat output when restarting after a crash which actually tends to have the most useful stack traces.Which is all to say, both Apple and Google make it really hard for a mobile app to find out why it crashed. Both Android and iOS create a crash report for any app which crashes, but the app can&#39;t access those. So we&#39;re all shipping apps with third-party crash handlers built-in that try to capture a stack or minidump in-process and make sense of it later."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I think this article hits on some truths and gets a handful of things wrong.  First, they are correct that we are in a dynamic profession that requires constant learning and expanding.  No doubt the people who choose to stay in software are likely to be people who are curious, life-long learners where this is a benefit of the profession rather than a drawback.  That said, one thing I noticed from teaching computer science while a graduate student is that the poor students think about languages and libraries as key skills, while the better students think about the data structures, algorithms, and design principles.  These slightly more meta-level concepts are far more stable and timeless, while the underlying implementations of them are constantly evolving.  If you think of each new library as &#34;having to learn a new skill&#34; I can imagine burnout and overload are more likely, but if you figure once you know 3D graphics you can pretty easily pickup any new graphics engine, then it might even seem fun to explore different takes on the same old concepts.  It&#39;s like hearing a new band in your favorite genre.As for attributing burnout as the core issue here, I would strongly disagree with this idea.  When teaching undergrads I noticed immediately that a good portion of each student cohort was basically there because they were interested in making money in the future rather than exploring the ideas of computer science.  They were no doubt going to get frustrated or bored and move into management or some other profession rather than continue to expand as an engineer.  This is totally fine, and they are probably richer for having learned what they did, but I don&#39;t know why we can&#39;t just see this and appreciate it for what it is rather than portraying it as the drama of burnout."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"A fascinating premise, and matches what I saw as an engineering director. The best just get bored and move on.I think many teams are unaware how much extra value is possible by retaining existing employees vs hiring new ones. Each year I&#39;d try to make sure I was &#34;making them an offer they couldn&#39;t refuse&#34; with new interesting challenges, new tech, plenty of personal research time, as much pay increase as I could possibly give, etc. A lot of engineering managers think that it&#39;s no big deal to just hire new staff, but even going from average turnover of two years to three years is an massive improvement."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"There is no shortage of swe. What I see and what I have experienced first hand is that companies, especially the more hyped/small ones, pretend to be FAANG and gets very picky when interviewing. They often employ FAANG style interview.Now, if I really have to spend that much time prepping to interview at your unprofitable company (that most likely will go under) don’t you think that I would try my best to work at faang instead ?As matter of fact, I was rejected at plenty of these small insignificant companies, but end up having offers as L6 at FAANG.Be humble and you will find plenty of good engineers out there.I know tons of good swe that don’t want to interview/ work at mega FAANG, and if I was running a business I would definitely try to attract those talents by being different. Offering a “normal and reasonable” interview process along with better perks, flexibility and wfh.Instead, they all want to run bizzilion of micro services in k8s"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The returns that capital demands (and the government obliges to) are ultimately unsustainable. That&#39;s the core problem here.Rising wages? There has been no meaningful real increase in wages in 40 years despite a massive increase in productivity. Profits keep going up and up. The expectations for profits keep going up. The problem here is that the people who make companies possible don&#39;t get to share in the proceeds of what they contribute to.Rising wages and lower profits would actually represent in workers actually getting an actual real increase in wages and getting a greater share in the fruits of their labor. But no, that&#39;s unacceptable. We have to raise prices to maintain the profits and effectively erode those wage increases.The real failure here is the government.Take rising energy prices. The government could take action to hasten development of existing leases and/or restrict the export of refined petroleum products. Oil hasn&#39;t gotten more expensive to produce. Oil and gas companies are simply raking in massive profits.What we actually need is a system like Norway where we don&#39;t simply give away natural resources like this for private investors to profit off. At least in Norway, the government is making a ton of revenue from the increased prices, which it can direct back to people who need it.Housing? Shelter is or should be a human right. What we&#39;re allowing to happen here through investors buying up housing stock (and jacking up the prices), second homes, AirBnB and so on has reached the point of being a human rights violation IMHO. Also those skyrocketing rents do even more to erode the income of particularly lower income people to keep them living paycheck to paycheck.This is modern serfdom in action. The government acts at the behest of the capital-owning class regardless of party and part of that is having a compliant labor pool. This is turning into the West&#39;s version of Pakistan&#39;s brick kilns.After going into massive debt for college, having to pay a huge amount for your car, gas and rent and so on, you&#39;re absolutely showing up to work. That&#39;s the point.A budget shortfall is built into your existence."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"You can argue either side to this, and make a good case.My personal preference is to trigger a recession and reduce inflation. The easy cop-out solution is to say a &#34;big f*ck off&#34; to pensioners, lower middle class, and poor people and let inflation soar, but I believe that long term this would be more destructive to the general economy. Better take the long term view here and not kick the can down the street."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Prediction higher interest rates will reverse the following trends:* Private car leases at near zero interest rate will stop. At one point it was sometime cheaper to lease than to buy a car for cash* Housing bubble. Near zero central bank/bank interest rates has inflated a housing bubble. Higher interest rates will decrease housing prices since fewer buyers will be able to afford higher interest mortages.* Tech bubble. Cheap interest has also funded some startups with non viable long term business ideas* Electric scooter rental companies. There will be fewer electric scooters since the interest rate to lease them will be higher. Electric scooter rental companies will afford fewer scooters.* Less investment companies buying up farmland. It will be more expensive to finance these deals* High leverage tech stocks over schiller p/e 15 rate will deflate.* There was no exponential startups growing forever. There was however debt growing an exponential rate. The world is still linear.
Linear power production.* Graphic cards for gaming will be more available for gamers again. Reason crypto currency mining will decrease deflate by higher interest rate not flowing as much into crypto.* Tech bubble less tech startups will effect cloud vendor footprint. Fewer tech startups less need to rent cloud services."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Brilliant approach, really. Never occurred to me to try something like this!Are you affected? Very likely. What can you do about it? Nerf your CPU performance by disabling &#34;turbo boost&#34; or equivalent. Should you do it? Probably not unless you&#39;re particularly vulnerable (journalist, human rights activist, etc.)One thing I found interesting that may get changed later, so I&#39;m documenting it here, is in their FAQ they say:&gt; Why did Intel ask for a long embargo, considering they are not deploying patches?
&gt;
&gt; Ask Intel.So Intel did ask for a long embargo, then apparently did nothing about it. My guess is they investigated &#34;can we actually mitigate this thing with a microcode update?&#34; and arrived at the conclusion after actually trying - or possibly after external influences were exerted (you be the judge) - that no, there&#39;s not much you can really do about this one.Later in the document another FAQ says:&gt; [...] Both Cloudflare and Microsoft deployed the mitigation suggested by De Feo et al. (who, while our paper was under the long Intel embargo, independently re-discovered how to exploit anomalous 0s in SIKE for power side channels).  [...]Which is again telling us that there indeed WAS a long embargo placed on this research by Intel.Only mentioning this here just in case the PR spin doctors threaten the researchers into removing mention of Intel on this one. Which honestly I hope doesn&#39;t happen because my interpretation is that Intel asked for that long embargo so they could investigate really fixing the problem (state agencies have more methods at their disposal and wouldn&#39;t need much time to exert influence over Intel if they decided to). Which speaks well of them IMO. But then again, not everybody&#39;s going to come to that same conclusion which is why I&#39;m slightly concerned those facts may get memory-holed."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This paper relies on Turbo P-states, where they measure the oscillation when that is active; it is not measuring general SpeedStep (OS software controlled) as some seem to have taken away from it. Turbo state is the HWP (hardware P-state controlled) layer above SpeedStep; turning off Turbo in the BIOS still fully allows OS controlled SpeedStep P-states to function, it just disables the hardware level bursting P-states above that max listed CPU level for short periods of time. As others have noted, Turbo state can really kill a laptop battery and/or drive up the thermals pretty quick, a lot of folks disable it anyways if they&#39;ve tinkered around before.The abstract writes it as &#34;When frequency boost is disabled, the frequency stays fixed at the base frequency during workload execution, preventing leakage via Hertzbleed. This is not a recommended mitigation strategy as it will very significantly impact performance.&#34; This is a confusing grammatical way to state it, as SpeedStep will still work at the OS layer, you&#39;ll scale min to max &#34;as usual&#34; and just lose temporary hardware boost max+ capability when under stress (full load at P0 state) - not really &#34;fixed&#34; as it were in layperson&#39;s terms. That would be more akin to saying SpeedStep had to be disabled, IMHO.https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/v4.19/admin-guide/pm/intel_p..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I suspect what we are seeing in the last few years is the slow death of purely symmetric multiprocessing.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I think if employees feel slighted by being fired, they&#39;re fooling themselves. The best mindset is that you could be gone tomorrow. It gives you clarity and purpose. It also happens to be the truth.Coinbase was also extremely generous with severance. 12 weeks plus two for every one year at the company, I think. I&#39;ve had the experience of being let go without notice and without severance.Devs seem a little more grizzled this time around, so I think this mindset is slowly becoming the norm. College grads seem skittish, but they always are.People keep pointing to Armstrong&#39;s $110M house like it&#39;s some sort of injustice. If you think billionaires should exist at all, then that&#39;s one of the least-bad injustices imaginable. It&#39;s probably true that no Armstrong, no Coinbase, and 10% of Coinbase is the prize.EDIT: It&#39;s actually 14 weeks: https://blog.coinbase.com/a-message-from-coinbase-ceo-and-co...Three and a half months of dev salary is pretty incredible."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Go back and read the HN thread from the Coinbase DPO [1]. Their valuation was insane then, before the war in Ukraine, inflation, or Omicron. The top comments on that thread shock me. Even at that time I expected every other comment to be about how overvalued they were, but it just wasn&#39;t the case.Wonder if people could&#39;ve been made to see this then. I went full on Chicken Little [2] and mostly just got treated like I was yelling at children to get off my lawn.1. https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=268082752. https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=26808275&amp;p=2#26812175"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Just a suggestion, but if your relationship with your wife depends on your personal circumstances and mood, then it sounds not very strong. Might be worth taking advantage of this good period to do some relationship strengthening exercises while you can so that when the next downturn happens, you can both understand each other&#39;s and your own feelings better. I&#39;m not talking about random activities like going to the beach but finding a good self-help book or therapist and sitting down together working through it regularly. It&#39;s easy for problems to grow silently until they&#39;re too big to fix. Relationships are far more important than jobs, money or houses."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Can&#39;t believe the negativity I see on some of the top comments right now.Congrats and thanks for sharing, you rock :)It&#39;s really nice to get updates from folks who posted an Ask HN. Especially with a positive outcome.It&#39;s really not uncommon for humans to find energizing work energizing, and for that to affect their overall quality of life. Plenty of people are comfortable checking boxes and going home early, sure, but that can be a slow death to a lot of folks (even some who might not realize it)."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Seek counseling. You&#39;re making life decisions based on web boards. Somehow programming and your relationship with your spouse are tied up together.You&#39;re riding really high now. You were really low before. Emotional roller coasters mean you should talk with someone, regardless of how you&#39;re feeling right now."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I spent 3 years living in one of the co-ops briefly mentioned in the article (&#34;In 2013, the administration took over the student-run anarchist house and painted over the old murals.&#34;). I wouldn&#39;t call it an &#34;anarchist house&#34; but it sure as hell was a lot of fun to live there. I painted some of those murals that are now apparently gone. We built a giant illegal loft in our room to make it two stories (which we would disassemble for a day every year when the fire inspection happened). We did some stupid and illegal shit, sure. But the sense of community was unparalleled. The alumni association owned the house, so we had to deal with all the maintenance. We came back to campus a week before everyone else every year to work on the house. We cooked and cleaned for ourselves. I&#39;ve never since experienced anything close to that same feeling of communal pride. It was a mess, but it was our beautiful mess."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"In fairness, this sort of transformation has taken place in every station of American life. My dweeb chemist parents regularly hosted and attended parties with their dweeb chemist colleauges. My wife and I have hosted 3 parties in the last 17 years.We had to fight for the modicum of freedom our kids had growing up. Our oldest now has a car but his licence forbids him taking friends along.[1]Our youngest built his first model rocket this week, to find it&#39;s only feasible to launch with a club. The nearest club, which used to host monthly launches at Moffett field, is closed until Fall. So it&#39;ll take as long to drive to and from the launch site as to buid a rocket, and the maximum launch cadence is monthly. Not a viable hobby for a 13-year-old, unless it&#39;s your only hobby and your parents help with everything.Churches have disintegrated, workplaces are toast. The loss of &#34;third places&#34; was measured by Putnam.[2] Somebody on twitter suggested companies should have sports teams, aparrently unaware it was quite common until recently.On my first day of work in California in 2001, my boss asked me if I&#39;d tried ecstasy yet.[3] Nowadays you must be mentally ill to take it, under a doctor&#39;s supervision.

								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; Stanford students live in brand new buildings with white walls. We have a $20 million dollar meditation center that nobody uses. But students didn’t ask for any of that. We just wanted a dirty house with friends.From my experience, covid exacerbated this significantly. I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s just the universities or a broader cultural shift. And as the article says, the administrators introduced more &#34;community initiatives&#34; to exonerate themselves of gleefully destroying campus life and letting it atrophy for two years straight (while making students pay in person tuition for online school)It feels like in the past couple years we&#39;ve gone from a culture of spontaneity and grassroots initiative to one of bitter obsequiousness that&#39;s obsessed with taking itself seriously. The only way to subvert it is by turning it into one big jokeedit: thanks to OP for posting this magazine, it&#39;s the first thing I&#39;ve seen in a while that actually has something to say"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This is so great. The 90s/pre OS-X Apple (the &#34;BuT tHeREs No SOFtWaRe!&#34; and &#34;ApPLe is GoING tO DiiEE&#34; Apple) had a sense of playfulness in their UIs that was largely lost when they became the Apple we know today.The Mac OS classic architecture definitely had some problems with its non-protected memory and cooperative multitasking, but what it _allowed_ were extensions that could really get in there and muck around with things… and I looovvvved the zaniness that provided. To name a few:- ResEdit!
- Extensions that could seriously improve your computer&#39;s performance like RamDoubler or SpeedDoubler
- That extension that made Oscar the grouch climb out of the trash can and sing a little ditty when you emptied the trash
- The talking moose was fun for about 15 minutes, but still, I love the attitude.
- After Dark!
- Easter eggs like that &#34;secret about box&#34; text clipping thing that pulled up the pirate flag flying over the Apple Campus. 
- Playful messaging like &#34;Installing System Morsels&#34;, or Sim City 2000&#39;s &#34;Reticulating Splines&#34;
- Even the iconography was more playful—that little bloated mac icon in the Memory control panel next to Virtual Memory comes to mindI miss the crew of developers, capabilities, and playfulness we lost in transitioning to OSX, but am thrilled that tiny fragments of this playfulness seem to be returning.Welcome back Clarus! Moof!"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Sure, this is a sweet little hit of nostalgia -- but it&#39;s also symptomatic of just how far Apple&#39;s come (back) with the Mac, and why. It&#39;s clear that we&#39;re way, way over the doldrums of the butterfly keyboard, abandoned Mac Pro, &#34;continues to be a product in our line-up&#34; years. Little things like this, little acknowledgements of the past and the Mac community, suggest to me why: the people in charge of the Mac are now people who _grew up with it_, who love it, and who have that same nostalgia as (some) of us outside Apple.They want the Mac to be great, too! If this was strictly playing on nostalgia it would have been a bit PR feature, or at least called out in WWDC. But instead it&#39;s just dropped in as an easter egg. Such a great sign."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; The keen-eyed among you may notice that although, it had a .pdf extension in assetutil info, I’ve given it here as a PNG. I was confused by this too, but upon closer inspection I believe the PNG is what ships with the OS. Although the .car format is not documented, you can still open it up in a hex viewer and learn a bit about what it contains. Looking through it, there appears to be some metadata for each file, followed by the image data itself.I reverse engineered the asset catalog format for a bit recently, hoping to be able to unpack and repack existing ones to create system appearances (themes/skins — these also come as .car files, and you can load one as an NSAppearance object and then apply it to your app/window/view).If it says it&#39;s a PDF, then it must be an actual PDF as a &#34;raw data&#34; rendition. I did successfully extract some with nothing but my own code. But, there are no PNGs present in .car files; as of Monterey, bitmap images use a proprietary undocumented compression format called &#34;deepmap2&#34;. I wasn&#39;t able to exactly reconstruct how it works because my skills of native code reverse engineering are lacking (or am I not using Ghidra correctly to get at least somewhat sensible code out of it?), but I did find the related functions in the vImage framework inside Accelerate.framework."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Looking forward to trying this out. I&#39;ve always felt that PagerDuty was absurdly expensive for the feature set they were offering. It costs something at least $250 per user for organization larger than 5 person - even if you&#39;re not an engineer who is ever directly on call. At my previous company, IT had to regularly send surveys to employees to assess if they really needed to have a PagerDuty account. Alerts are a key information in an organization that runs software in production and you shouldn&#39;t have to pay $250 / month just to be able to have some visibility into it. I&#39;m hoping Grafana OnCall is able to fully replace PagerDuty."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Hello HN!Matvey Kukuy, ex-CEO of Amixr and a head of the OnCall project here. We&#39;ve been working hard for a few months to make this OSS release happen. I believe it should make incident response features (on-call rotations, escalations, multi-channel notifications) and best practices more accessible to the wider audience of SRE and DevOps engineers.Hope someone will be able to finally sleep well at night being sure that OnCall will handle escalations and will alert the right person :)Please join our community on a GitHub! The whole Grafana OnCall team is help you and to make this thing better."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I love Grafana, don&#39;t get me wrong, but I have the sensation they are now in that position where, companies that got a massive capital injection and, therefore, a massive increase of work power, release too much and too soon.It doesn&#39;t have anything to do, of course, with the fact that this morning we suddenly found that all our dashboards stopped working because we were upgraded to Grafana v9, for which there is not a stable release nor documentation for breaking changes.Luckily they rolled back our account."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"many may be too young to remember but Eddie Lampert did this with Sears in the 80s and 90s as a thinly veiled attempt to turn the company into some kind of obscure land broker.  It did not end well, and serves to this day as a textbook example of ideology eclipsing principled, well researched business decisions.in the article Bloomberg attempts to invent reasons this practice is dicey for Amazon that dont involve &#34;you arent a real estate company&#34; but fall short.  the regulatory landscape they paint simply doesnt exist in the places (texas) they want to buy land.the real reason is likely to prevent competitors from setting up their own warehouses, as Lampert frequently did the same thing by buying out anchors and real estate in an attempt to funnel customers back into sears during its declining era as it was being bled dry by VC style profit chicanery that doesnt involve store refreshes or new markets."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"As a Brit that didn’t want Scotland to be independent last time around: good luck to them. Brexit has shown very clearly that Scotland wants to chart a different path to England and IMO they should be allowed to do it.…just be generous to English folks seeking asylum from Tory rule, yeah?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"With hard headed view, I struggle to see that an independent Scotland will be economically able to deal with large cuts to public sector spending that would almost certainly be required. Per capita spending is already higher in Scotland than in the rest of the UK. Scottish companies have debts denominated in pounds. There would almost certainly be capital flight to rUK. Large businesses may relocate. There is no plan for a new currency, which would leave Scotland either with a weaker currency than sterling, or with a currency it has no influence over.The UK is obviously suffering economically because of Brexit - an economic relationship that was built up over 40 years or so. Scotland, England and Wales have been a country since 1707. Just imagine the complication of breaking that. It makes Brexit look like a tiny job. Scotland would need to set up mirrors of institutions completely administered by Westminster at great cost, with a shrinking and aging population which is poorer, less educated and less healthy than the rest of the UK, even despite much of the things influencing that (healthcare, education) being devolved to the Scottish government since 1997.I certainly don’t think it’s impossible. But I think it’s like Irish independence - it took the best part of 70 years for Ireland to economically recover. Over that time there was vast emigration to the UK and the US. Part of that was my own family who moved to the UK in the 1950s because of terrible job prospects in the Republic."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"One quite important issue is the border. English and Scottish people will almost certainly never tolerate any kind of friction at that border. We&#39;ve been moving across it seamlessly for centuries, families are mixed, businesses straddle the border, etc. If the Northern Ireland debacle has shown us anything, it&#39;s if Scotland were to leave and then join the EU that border would become an absolute political nightmare. The EU has an absolutist position on border integrity, but locals have an absolutist position of border porosity. I don&#39;t think there&#39;s a compromise that both sides could tolerate."</p>
