								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Context on what I believe they mean by &#34;fraudulent&#34;.Steam back in the day used to accept 0 confirmation bitcoin spends. This means that the transaction has been gossiped on the bitcoin p2p network but had not yet been mined into a block and thus had minimal finality guarantees. Steam could see that they were going to receive a bitcoin payment (when the transaction was mined into a block) and would credit the users account instantly for a better purchase UX.Turns out anyone with some deeper understanding of bitcoin could construct another transaction spending the same bitcoin back to themselves before their original transaction was ever put in a block. The bitcoin community moved away from accepting &#39;0 conf&#39; transactions pretty much everywhere because of this reason.In fact the high fee era (2016-2018) saw many wallets incorporating this &#34;double spend&#34; feature into their wallets. This is known as RBF, &#34;replace by fee&#34; and is really useful when you need to bump your transaction up the queue. You replace your old transaction, that is waiting to be mined, with a new one that offers a higher fee to incentivize miners to add it to a new block.I think its rather unfortunate that 0 conf transactions were written off so quickly. There are many context where a 0conf tx makes sense, mostly IRL. But, if you are running a business online and you don&#39;t trust you customers you should wait 3-6 blocks after the transaction has been mined before delivering your goods."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Unfortunately no details were given about what makes 50% of all bitcoin transactions “fraudulent” ?What does that even mean?* did someone try to send something other then bitcoin to a ₿ address?* did a client claim he payed and did the payment seem to fail on his end?* did a client not realise that you as payee also pay for the network fee?Nowadays these kind of problems would be easily prevented by using bitcoin lightning payments, because they work in a fraction of a second and specify the exact amount that has to be payed.
Also they are almost free of transaction costs."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"There seems to be a basic misunderstanding on the part of the pro-btc ppl here all saying &#34;how is that fraud?&#34; or &#34;how is that steams problem?&#34;If you run a business that can be used in a money laundering scheme, even if you are not a victim, you have a legal responsibility to try to limit/prevent that actually.The crypto crowd may not like that, but it&#39;s not up to them."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This with WINE is what I think is the perfect combination of GUI and CLI... but as a long-time Windows user, several things stood out and made it look slightly off:    the menu bar and padding around the icon labels is too tall
    the window borders are slightly too wide (compared to the default)
    scrollbar buttons shouldn&#39;t disable at end of travel
    sort direction indicator in header control (which first appeared in Win2k) should be a grey triangle, not a black arrow
    &#34;KiB&#34; and &#34;GiB&#34;
    font has some weird keming in some places

Nonetheless, this is a lot closer lookalike than some of the others I&#39;ve seen, such as this one:https://kmandla.wordpress.com/projects/lookalike-windows-xp-..."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; Make Linux look exactly like Windows 95... I mean *exactly*.Good try, but if you&#39;re going to emphasize the exactness, I&#39;m going to nitpick.In the top picture ( https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_p... ), the menu bar has too much vertical padding and lacks mnemonic (underlined) letters. The amount of padding on the desktop icon text also looks off. A good example is https://socket3.files.wordpress.com/2016/10/w95ptoys-1.png .In the second picture ( https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_p... ), Calculator just looks completely off. The Taskbar has too much space between the icon and window title. The tray icons should go in the same box as the clock, not outside. Good examples: https://i.pinimg.com/originals/27/fc/05/27fc05d3f826760c7fd0... ; https://www.cultofmac.com/ezoimgfmt/cdn.cultofmac.com/wp-con...And this isn&#39;t even going as far as to nitpick the exact font-rendering algorithm down to the pixel."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Microwave drilling. It&#39;s a known thing at small scale.[1] If it can be done at larger scale, it ought to have other applications. Doing it downhole at the end of a long pipe string is going to be much harder than doing it in a factory. So why isn&#39;t this an industrial machining process already, like plasma cutting?GA Drilling was pushing plasma drilling back in 2018.[2] They&#39;re still pushing it, but not making holes.The University of Minnesota was pushing electro-pulse boring in 2015.[3] Again, no deep holes.There&#39;s something called ThermoDrilling, which, despite the name, is more like a water jet cutter.[4]Successful projects are still using mechanical drilling.[5]So there are a lot of deep hole drilling approaches being studied. Anything that works would be used by the oil and gas industry, and if they&#39;re not trying it, one suspects it might not be working.[1] https://www.researchgate.net/publication/270653673_Microwave...[2] https://www.gadrilling.com/[3] https://experts.umn.edu/en/publications/electro-pulse-boring...[4] https://www.geodrillinginternational.com/deep-geothermal/new...[5] https://geothermalengineering.co.uk/united-downs/"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Something I&#39;ve always wondered.Wouldn&#39;t massive scale geothermal end up pumping more heat into the atmosphere that otherwise wouldn&#39;t be there?In contrast, the energy collected by solar and wind generators is from the energy added to Earth by the sun and would be energy in our atmosphere regardless of whether  or not we collect it.But it seems like the heat inside the Earth&#39;s core should be fairly well insulated by the lithosphere, and it only slowly leaks out over time. If we start pulling that energy out at a faster rate to generate electricity, could that have a noticeable net increase on total energy under the atmosphere, or is it such an insignificant amount of energy relative to the sun&#39;s to not even bother worrying about?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Yeah right. They drilled in Strasbourg, France, to get this &#34;free&#34; energy. When they entered production, the city was experiencing an earthquake every month, waking the city at night.
After a magnitude 4 earthquake, they finally shut down the plant.A town in Germany is  devastated also due to geothermal power: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Staufen_im_Breisgau"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Something interesting I guess most people don&#39;t know, the pro-ukrainian mobilisations in Poland (I can only speak about Poland) is amazing. My FB wall is full of people providing their apartments for free, giving jobs etc. There is over 100 cars long queue at a border willing to transport Ukrainians escaping war where they want. They can travel by train for free in Poland.Now not so good tidbit. Just few months ago we had a lot of people lured into Belarus by Lukashenko trying to come to Europe. Poland treated them really really poorly. Catching them after crossing border and pushing them back. The society was split among pro-refugees and anti. The political parties almost all focused on &#34;protecting our border&#34;.I was afraid that this natalist sentiment might repeat, even though Ukrainians are one of the closest people to Poland. I am very happy to note I haven&#39;t heard anyone speaking against refugees from Ukraine, not on twitter not on facebook not by far-right parties, altough I am sure some people are silent about their opinions."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Context:Portugal has a large and extremely well integrated Ukrainian community.
Ukrainians constitute the second-largest foreign community residing in Portugal.https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ukrainians_in_Portugal"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Portugal is such an awesome country. I love going there and wouldn&#39;t mind staying there a bit longer at some point.More countries should do this; Germany and my home country the Netherlands in particular. I live in Berlin currently as a foreigner (perfect place for that). Lots of people from all over eastern Europe live here, lots of companies here outsource all over eastern Europe, lots of people that I know either come from or have friends/family from the Ukraine. Also, about 200k people of Russian origin live here that chose to move here after the wall fell. And I assume quite a few Ukranians.I remember meeting refugees from the former Yugoslavia in the nineties. I think 25 years later, a lot of those people did pretty well. I actually visited Bosnia for work last summer and met a guy that went to school in Munich. Likewise a lot of Syrian refugees that ended up in Germany seem to be doing OK. Quite a few ended up here in Berlin. In times of war, people are generally grateful if you accommodate them; even if it isn&#39;t always with open arms.It&#39;s usually the smart, free thinkers that need to flee. Incidentally those are also people likely to find a way to make it in life; start businesses; or otherwise be generally successful.The US is full of such people that emigrated there after various wars in the last century. Now is not a time to be xenophobic about this sort of thing."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The US and EU are also placing sanctions on the Russian central bank. Experts quoted by the Financial Times seem to believe that this is more impactful than the SWIFT disconnect:’Josh Lipsky, a former IMF adviser now at the Atlantic Council think-tank, said earlier the US imposing sanctions on the Russian central bank would be an “extraordinarily significant and damaging move to the Russian economy”.’“A G20 central bank has never been sanctioned before. This is not Iran. This is not Venezuela. So to shut off their central bank from the international financial system, or at least the dollar and euro economy, is a massively destabilising move potentially,” said Lipsky.’Edward Fishman, a former US official now at the Center for a New American Security, said it would present a “devastating blow” to the Russian economy that would eclipse the significance of a ban on Swift.’"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"It is definitely the last one.&gt;Last, using swift as a weapon against Russia could hurt long-term American interests. America holds sway over international finance thanks to the dollar’s dominance and its pre-eminent role in global settlement systems. Further politicising swift would give China an incentive to bolster cips, its rival to swift for cross-border payments in yuan. It would also help China court any country with uneasy relations with America looking for alternatives.I would imagine there are additional politics in play with disabling SWIFT. I dont how many countries will need to agree before shutting down SWIFT access, if it is at the will of US it would be more like a semi-nuclear option.Although I am already surprised by CIPS, one eighth of transaction volume of SWIFT is not &#34;well behind&#34;. From many POV this already seems like a battle the west are clearly losing."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&#34;Why the West is reluctant to deny Russian banks access to SWIFT&#34;Because Europe is dependent on Russian gas (thanks to an ill thought out denuclearization drive), and both Europe and US governments prefer their economic and electoral interests over Ukraine or the international order. The rest of the article are really silly excuses (Russia is a relatively small economy and can&#39;t meaningfully hurt the dollar etc.)."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"It can be, relatively speaking, quite easy to defend a city, the Syrian rebels in East Aleppo became quite good at it pretty fast, the same goes for the rebels in the Damascus neighbourhood of Jobar (for this latter example I recommend this video [1], it gives a general idea of how it well went; bear in mind that it was filmed from the pov of the government forces).The problem is that the attacking force at some point realises that the defendants are pretty well dug in and the commanders of those attacking forces also realise that one of the few solutions available in order to achieve victory is to, almost quite literally, flatten the city. That&#39;s what happened in East Aleppo (with the help of the Russian airforce), that&#39;s what happened in Jobar, too. Not sure if the flattening of Kyiv would be the best thing for the Ukranian people going forward.[1] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9ZXPhmR7lQ"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Interesting read. I guess it&#39;s self-evident, but not having thought about the topic, the utility of rubble and repurposing semi-destroyed structures, as well as how important snipers are, were new to me. Maybe the importance of snipers makes civilians being handed out guns in Kyiv now seem less futile.Would be interested to read a basic explainer along these lines on &#34;How to Rebuild a City&#34; -- I guess one divergence from urban planning/development literature would be on how to reuse rubble? Given the many destroyed cities through history including this century which have been at least partially reubilt (perhaps Grozny was first of this century?) I guess there must be plenty written on this topic."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"We’ll this is just massively embarrassing for YouTube. The Reddit thread will get picked up by National media. YouTube will say the reporting was misuse of their terms and was a cyberattack from state level actors implying their reporting algo isn’t actually at fault. They will mention that the automated algo protects children and at risk people. They will then reinstate the accounts and say they are sorry for the temporary inconvenience and pleased that they could respond so swiftly. And the algos won’t change, not one bit. And there will still be no human oversite of these sorts of bans."</p>

It happened to a lot of us too, it seems some Russian bots have been mass-reporting every single person that watched them&gt; Yes, yesterday night I watched a livestream. Im shocked&gt; I also watched a Livestream yesterday night.

								<p class="story__comment_others">"This should come as a surprise to absolutely nobody.  People have been complaining for a decade now that all automated takedown bots are ripe for abuse are are actively being abused by media cartels.  You can&#39;t be shocked when systems that enable abuse are abused by foreign intelligence services.Google has said it is cheaper to ignore the problem and until that changes they aren&#39;t going to fix it.  And remember that on the other end of these abusive systems are corporations that are willing to sue individuals for literally billions of dollars over sharing files.Big corporations will not have your back when it could affect their income stream."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"A lot of discussion on this last time it came up:https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=22341983"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Author here, didn’t expect to see this here again after two years!I guess I’ll give a quick update on how things have been since this article was written. I haven’t used or studied French much since then, and have gotten quite rusty, though I’ve had a few conversations fully in French in the last few months and can still maintain a conversation. I have been thinking of picking up French again soon, as traveling to a French speaking country becomes more of an option.I also did roughly the same thing with my Spanish in the following year, with similar results, though I’d say I probably reached a solid B1.5 or weak B2 after a year (due to COVID I was unable to take the proficiency test and lost some motivation to continue studying to a high level as a result.)My recommendations are still largely the same, though I haven’t used these resources (e.g. Duolingo) since I stopped studying a while back. And as others have noted, for other languages, particularly those that are less closely related to English (e.g. Japanese), you’ll have to follow a different path to achieve the same proficiency. However, language learning resources are getting better constantly, so you can certainly still learn quite a lot without total, in-person immersion, as I did!"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I learned Spanish, too, in about 12 months to dogfood my new app for learning vocabulary (which I just recently launched) [0]Even though I made an app that helped me along the way to learn words, I don&#39;t believe in a single app/book/approach for learning a language. You need to expose yourself to A LOT of different language materials.I was learning for about 2h a day, 6 times a week. I would read articles, books, websites in Spanish. I would watch YouTube videos [1]. I would read news, initially for beginners [2] and later regular [3]. And most importantly, I would have 4-5h a week itakly conversations.After 6 months I understood quite a lot, but couldn&#39;t speak almost at all. Then magic happens and 6 months later, I was having a normal conversation (though still with some errors) about any range of topics: politics, global warming, travel, engineering etc.I believe the key for me was to read a lot of books which were interesting to me. For example I read Bill Gate&#39;s book &#34;How To Avoid A Climate Disaster&#34; in Spanish, as well as about ~8 others in the first 12 months.[0] https://www.obstino.com[1] https://www.youtube.com/c/DreamingSpanish[2] www.newsinslowspanish.com[3] https://elpais.com"</p>

I can 100% confirm that all money in the world is just literally numbers, and it is balanced by the different federal reserve systems around the world to ensure no one can &#34;create&#34; money without notifying everyone.I guess if I was super cool I would do an AMA because this is the only thread that is really my time to shine hahaha."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I often wonder how money is stored.It can&#39;t be just a number on a computer in a bank, right? Otherwise some Russian bank could just increase that number to whatever they like. And say &#34;Look, we own 100 Trillion USD. Now let&#39;s go shopping.&#34;.So I guess USD needs to be recognized by the US somehow?Could the US simply &#34;void&#34; all USD that are owned by Russia?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt;Russia has also been building an in-house system since 2014—the last time SWIFT cutoff was threatened—which may mean they are able to temper some of the impact a cutoff would have on its economy.If they&#39;re building a replacement, doesn&#39;t that also mean we should use &#34;cut off SWIFT&#34; now, rather than later when it&#39;ll be ineffective?"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I&#39;d actually put the blame here on browsers, and how limited the default inputs are.There are too many needlessly reimplemented components, but anyone that has ever needed to style a &lt;select&gt; to make it look in line with any modern design quickly reached desperation.I&#39;d love to be able to use standard components everywhere, but most of my users care if my website looks like it&#39;s from 2004."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Worst of those I encounter regularly is US sites trying to constrain your input to numbers only on certain fields.
Not &#34;letting you input anything and marking it invalid if you put something other than a number&#34;, but listening to which key is pressed to allow the typing or not.
On French keyboards, typing a number requires the use of the SHIFT key. So I regularly need to change my keyboard layout just to type a couple numbers in a form field because someone thought they&#39;d be smart..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I agree with the author that custom components don’t capture all the interaction details. Many times they are not accessible or cannot implement cross-platform input well.However, I disagree with:&gt; The browser’s built-in controls are quite sufficient.The problem is that browser components are good for simple forms but insufficient for other types of interaction.A good example is select. Using the select tag is the best way to have a dropdown list that’s accessible and supports mobile. But, select doesn’t cover most of the cases that you need for a complex app.Many of the WAI ARIA authoring examples  (including the combobox patterns) are not covered by built in components. Interaction patterns like pop ups, dialogs, or lookup lists are quite common for an app… but hard to do in an accessible/cross-platform way.Web browsers need to do something different to support accessible/usable apps. The idea of leaving all those things to WebComponents makes sense, but the result is reinventing the broken wheel on each app."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Years ago I worked at a company where many people were using Grammarly. One of the top devs took a look at it, and saw that the text was sent to Grammarly&#39;s server unencrypted and warned everyone not to use it. Some still did.At my previous engagement, a large number of staff spoke English as a second or third language, and Grammarly was prevalent. Even as a native English speaker, they wanted me to use it as a sort of proof reader. I&#39;ll admit that it caught some of my dumber mistakes, but I never felt comfortable using it. I could have proof-read my work better is all. Perhaps if I wasn&#39;t given mind-numbing work, the quality would have been better."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I think worse than keyloggers is that people are learning how to make the yellow lines in Grammarly go away rather than learning to write better. The training of humans on AI which was trained to be a (dull) average of prior humans has unforeseen consequences. I&#39;ve seen Google grammar suggestions getting worse with time."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"In Québec we have Antidote. It&#39;s a good &#34;old&#34; piece of software you install on your computer and it integrates with office and other programs to provide _explanations_ of why what you write, looks wrong. No keylogger, no getting dumber. It essentially let&#39;s you either learn why you&#39;re wrong or decide the software is wrong. It used to be French only but they added English too a couple years back. I have no affiliation with Antidote, I just use it everyday."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I&#39;m a huge AMD fan but this is bonkers.Yes, Intel has floundered for a number of years, but at the same time they are a foundry themselves, second only to TSMC (for now), have incredible manufacturing capacity, and seem poised to start pushing interesting CPU designs as well as having their foundry half finally start executing correctly. Also their growth potential for their GPU business is huuuuuuge.As someone who enjoys AMD for the competition they bring, I am worried what the next few years might look like for them for the following reasons:1. AMD GPUs were actually very competitive with their RDNA2 architecture, but at the same time AMD enjoyed a huge silicon advantage as they were on TSMC while NVIDIA was on Samsung (for consumer). The next generation of NVIDIA consumer GPUs will be made by TSMC and if their professional GPUs (see A100 which are made by TSMC) are any indication we can see potentially up to 1.5x to 2x efficiency bump for NVIDIA.2. Intel seems to be cleaning up shop and their latest generation of CPUs feel like a 1st Gen Ryzen moment. Also, Intel does not have to clearly surpass AMD, they just need to be competitive as they can simply out produce AMD given AMDs relatively small allocation at TSMC.3. Intel GPUs pose a moderate threat on the horizon for AMD for both low end and portables and at the same time they are eating up available capacity at TSMC."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Just want to clear things up.The reason why AMD is suddenly catching up to Intel in valuation is because of the confirmation / success acquisition of Xilinx. Which triggered the conversion of 250M Xilinx shares to new AMD shares. Adding roughly $40B to its market cap."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Something that has gone unmentioned in these comments: Intel has a lot more debt than AMD (38B vs 661M on 12/31). That does affect their comparative market cap by, you know, roughly 37 billion dollars. (give or take some amount related to their credit rating and the very low cost of money right now, I would think, and if you want something to argue about there&#39;s always the fact that Intel has an even better credit rating than AMD...)Intel has much, much more income than AMD and they&#39;re valued similarly by the market and... that is not a mystery.https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/INTC/financials?p=INTChttps://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AMD/financials?p=AMD"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"If I understand this correctly, the FCC has allocated the 4.2GHz-4.4GHz band for radar altimeters. The FCC has also allocated the 3.7GHz-3.98GHz band to 5G. It turns out that the radar altimeters, as manufactured, use spectrum outside their allocated band, down to and including part of the 3.7GHz-3.98GHz 5G band.Am I missing something?If a rancher buys a plot of land from 34.42°N to 34.44°N to graze his cattle on, but in actual fact grazes his cattle all the way from 34.37°N to 34.47°N. Then a farmer buys a plot of land from 34.37°N to 34.398°N to grow wheat on. Does the rancher still get to herd his cattle down to 34.39°N to feed his cattle? The cattle have to eat, after all, and cutting down the grazing land by 30% could cause some cattle to starve to death. And the rancher has a vested financial interest in ensuring his cattle are well fed, and that wheat is good eating. And the rancher has always been grazing his cattle there, what right does the farmer have to till the soil on the racher&#39;s grazing land? And we, the American public, have the right to buy beef. Why should the farmer purchasing 34.37°N to 34.398°N interfere with my ability to buy a steak?Does any of this make any sense to anyone?Unless there&#39;s additional information I&#39;m unaware of, it seems as if the design and/or manufacture of the radar altimeter is not fit for purpose. Using 3.7GHz to 3.98GHz for 5G doesn&#39;t break the radar altimeters; the radar altimeters are already broken and must be fixed or grounded, because the equipment is broken and unsafe.If 5G equipment is emitting outside of its allocated 3.7-3.98GHz spectrum then the FCC needs to drop a brick on that of course."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I don’t know much about aviation or electrical engineering, and I’m wondering if anyone could help me understand something.It seems like the telecom and aviation industries (along with the FCC and FAA) disagree on a question of fact: does 5G equipment interfere with radio altimeters?There’s a way that the FAA could convince me, and probably all the politicians. Shoot a video with a radio altimeter and some 5G equipment where the radio altimeter malfunctions. Put it on YouTube. Do a press release.This seems like an obvious step if the underlying issue exists. Any reason they haven’t done this?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Wow, this along with potential interference problems in weather radar [0], it&#39;s obvious the FCC bungled allocating the 5G spectrum. What a shame that they gave into industry pressure over other practical considerations.However, it doesn&#39;t surprise me that the FAA, which allowed the Boeing 737Max fiasco, is back here coming to Boeing&#39;s defense. What happens when 2 captured regulators collide?Edit: added spacing and changed &#34;radio&#34; to &#34;radar&#34; for clarity[0] https://www.npr.org/2019/07/02/737919100/forecasters-caution..."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I&#39;ve found the reason (I think) 90% of the world&#39;s semiconductor-grade neon production is concentrated in one country. Per this German government whitepaper about the noble gas industry: the USSR massively overinvested in neon capacity in the 1980&#39;s, in order to build space-based excimer laser weapons. Ukraine&#39;s extant plants date (probably) to the 1980&#39;s; they&#39;re responsible for a global oversupply that&#39;s persisted since the Cold War.- &#34;Neon was regarded as a strategic resource in the former Soviet Union, because it was believed to be required for the intended production of laser weapons for missile and satellite defence purposes in the 1980s. Accordingly, all major air separation units in the Soviet Union were equipped with neon, but also krypton and xenon, enrichment facilities or, in some cases, purification plants (cf. Sections  5.4 and 5.5). The domestic Soviet supply of neon was extremely large but demand low.&#34;- &#34;Following the collapse of the Soviet Union, global crude neon production was approximately 500–600  million  l/a  (=  500,000–600,000 m3/a).  It  was dominated by far by large-scale air separation units associated with metallurgical combines in Russia and Ukraine. Simultaneously, demand was estimated at around 300 million l/a (cf. Section 4.2). In the years between 1990 and 2012, therefore,  most crude  neon was not  purified, but  released into the atmosphere, because there was no customer base.&#34;https://www.deutsche-rohstoffagentur.de/DE/Gemeinsames/Produ... (chapter 5.2)For context, this would have overlapped with Energia/Buran&#39;s launch of the Polyus weapon (which was a megawatt CO2 laser).https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyus_(spacecraft)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"How is neon extracted and why does one country have a 90% monopoly (in this specific grade)?edit: Found this C&amp;EN story from 2016 that adds context:- &#34;Chip makers, which account for more than 90% of global neon consumption, are already experiencing high prices and some shortages stemming from the Russian conflict with Ukraine, Shon-Roy says. The war, which started in 2014, interrupted global supplies of the gas, about 70% of which comes from Iceblick, a firm based in the Ukrainian city of Odessa.&#34;- &#34;Iceblick gathers and purifies neon from large cryogenic air separation units that supply oxygen and nitrogen to steelmakers. Most of the air separation units equipped to capture neon, which makes up only 18.2 ppm of the atmosphere by volume, are in Eastern Europe.&#34;https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/cen-09410-notw7This is puzzling to me, because I don&#39;t get why air separation should naturally concentrate in exactly one place. It&#39;s not tied to a rare and localized geologic formation, like helium sort-of is.Also there&#39;s cryogenic air separation plants all over the planet, why don&#39;t they do neon too? (Asking in the spirit of curiosity)edit #2: I&#39;ve just found something that offers a possible explanation and it&#39;s far more interesting than I expected:- &#34;Neon was regarded as a strategic resource in the former Soviet Union, because it was believed to be required for the intended production of laser weapons for missile and satellite defence purposes in the 1980s. Accordingly, all major air separation units in the Soviet Union were equipped with neon, but also krypton and xenon, enrichment facilities or, in some cases, purification plants (cf. Sections  5.4 and 5.5). The domestic Soviet supply of neon was extremely large but demand low.&#34;https://www.deutsche-rohstoffagentur.de/DE/Gemeinsames/Produ...

								<p class="story__comment_others">"We should be talking about grain, not gas.Russia is the biggest exporter of wheat in the world with 18%. Ukraine accounts for 7% of the world&#39;s wheat.https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2022/2/17/infographic-russia-...This conflict will affect 1/4 of the world&#39;s wheat which will affect food prices.In 2010 Russia stopped exporting wheat due to wildfires burning their fields (most likely caused by climate change). This caused a hike in food prices which helped trigger the Arab revolutions in 2011.https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2010_Russian_wildfires"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I&#39;m in downtown Kharkiv, Ukraine right now (SaaS founder born in Canada). Woke up to explosions at 5 AM this morning. At 12PM still some explosions, can feel the ground shaking, but the streets are mostly calm. Went out to buy some groceries, long lines, but everything still works. Police cars are out patrolling in full force, but no signs of unrest. Church bells tolling nonstop. TransferWise is limited to $200 USD transfers but it worked -- Apple Pay worked at the grocery store. Obviously internet and electricity is still up for now, but water pipes have been shut off in many of my friend&#39;s places."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"From a philosophical stance, this is history repeating for the same basic reason. 2022 AD and risk of war is still the same as it was in 1022 AD, or 22 AD. That reason is the accumulation of power (or by proxy, wealth) in a small set of individuals, or in this case one person. No realtime access to information changes this; it just makes the story of the horror unfold faster.Persisting with the concentration of power in individuals has shown throughout history to have dire consequence. We continue risking civilization on the mental health of those who already show significant issues with their obsessive clammer for power. The cult of the leader is toxic and, as far as I can see, illogical and lacking evidence for benefit.Where are the voices that seek a structured shift away from personality cult politics? The innovation we all need for the future are those voices."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"It&#39;s a weird place to be where I can watch a war unfold on television and have live geotagged curated material laid out on a map on my computer.  It&#39;s amazing and depressing at the same time."</p>

What then? Strongly worded essays? If Russia isn&#39;t raining hell on Poland, then NATO is forced to .. apply sanctions, make threats, but take no action since the escalation and outcome, MAD, is not an acceptable trade for a tank crossing your border.Repeat until arrival at French coastline. The terrorist steps forward waving a trigger to a bomb and either you show him your bomb and threaten to blow yourselves both up, or you step back.At some point, the only option is to call the bluff and give him a good punch and hope that he values life as much as you and won&#39;t actually detonate.

Its massive territory extends over 8 times zones stretching over 2 continents and it has historically been incapable of governing most of it.

Geopolitical stuff aside, this incessant need to have more land and more control when you can&#39;t even deal with the shit you already have is just baffling."</p>

Instead of fixing the default to be safe, and possibly having a _unsafe_but_fast() variant for the places where it makes sense they want to keep the broken version and require user to explicitly opt in into safety.Same as the infamous PHP mysql_real_escape_string (don&#39;t make the mistake of using mysql_escape_string!)

So still very impressive, but Magnus loses games online all the time and I&#39;m not _quite_ sure why this is news.It is interesting which junior players Magnus invited to the tournament, though - besides Praggnanandhaa, there&#39;s also Andrey Esipenko, who _did_ beat Magnus in a classical game once at the prestigious Tata Steel Masters 2021, and also Nodirbek Abdusattorov, who beat Magnus late last year en route to becoming the World Rapid Champion at 17 years old. A fun group! With Vincent Keymer in the mix too, you&#39;re only really missing Nihal Sarin and (of course) Firouzja for many of the future faces of chess.[Edit: the article says that Praggnanandhaa is the youngest player ever to beat Magnus since 2013, which would definitely be newsworthy. I think the article must be leaving out important context, since this tournament is (1) online, (2) speed chess and (3) not FIDE rated, so it typically wouldn&#39;t be included in records, and Magnus has almost certainly lost random online games to younger players before. I&#39;m guessing the article is referencing some other source without providing the relevant criteria, which is why it looked a little weird to me.]"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is noted in another comment, but it should be a top level comment... Magnus actively has COVID and has said that it was affecting his energy levels and ability to calculate during the early rounds of the tournament (during which this game happened).And Pragg wasn&#39;t even the lowest rated player to beat Magnus this tournament! Eric Hansen, aka popular chess streamer &#34;chessbrah&#34;, is even lower rated and also beat Magnus, which again you would not expect if Magnus were playing his usual level.So still a great win and great accomplishment for Pragg, but a little context would have been nice in the article."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Even Prags coach pointed out [1], let&#39;s not get carried away. This was a great achievement but the pressure this creates can be very bad for him in the longer run.[1]: https://mobile.twitter.com/Rameshchess/status/14964993222462..."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This thread is mostly full of jokes, and that&#39;s cool. But more seriously I&#39;m exactly the kind of person I suppose this is meant to appeal to. I&#39;ve spent the last 2-3 decades breaking into systems. Many of these systems comprise what the US calls &#34;critical infrastructure&#34;. That&#39;s pipelines, power generation, transmission, distribution. Air traffic control systems. Government agencies.I&#39;m based in the US. The problem is that the US, unlike Russia, will not simply agree to allow attacks against foreign targets so long as its suits their strategic purposes. And I suppose that&#39;s for the best. In the meantime, myself and people like me simply aren&#39;t going to risk our entire careers to retaliate. I suppose if we felt strongly enough we would&#39;ve joined the NSA and done this legally. I wish Ukraine the best and hope our &#34;official&#34; hackers are doing their best to assist or will be unleashed soon."</p>

Looks like, all people who got to government or state organizations, work on classical totalitarian scheme - &#34;for friends all the best, for all others - severity of the law&#34;.
Mean, system is so much disbalanced, that any government got totalitarian power and does not account on people. And laws are created, to make all people offenders, and with very wide possibilities of interpretation, so state officials and their friends become above law.If you really want to help Ukraine, better to contact volunteers-entrepreneurs, who where on Maidan, and who struggle for economic freedoms, and support Ukrainian army as private persons, without government/state.You could just donate, or you could create some business opportunity, so Ukrainians will make business, export working hours, or export some products to world.Business opportunities much better, because Ukraine now have critically huge dependence on Russian market, close to 50% of all trade, need much-much more export to world.Thank You!"</p>

Shipping an app to the general public with symbols intact? Really? If they didn&#39;t know/didn&#39;t care, it tells me no one there likely cared about any other quality issue either. It&#39;s highly likely that any relevant lead person probably screamed about this daily, but higher ups don&#39;t give a shit.At my last job our legal team would have had a cow shipping labels. Our apps are gleaned by blogs looking for scoops on upcoming features.I once interviewed at a major airline (not United) and at the time they had outsourced their entire app and web to some foreign companies, including any and all oversight. Their app was a POS and they had hired someone to write a new one -- the same company. Now they had no idea why it was so delayed so they wanted to hire someone to embed in the other company to spy on what was going on. Of course I wanted nothing to do with this travesty. This was years ago, no idea what happened.You&#39;d be amazed at how pathetic mobile development can be even at big companies. Mobile doesn&#39;t have to be hard, but if management tries hard enough, can make crap at scale."</p>

Depending on the last state of the system, the display usually had a bunch of ugly LCD noise on it.Eventually I got around to implementing a rudimentary framebuffer to send to the display. Wondering what to display, I figured I&#39;d compute a Mandelbrot fractal!People liked it, and I was happy to have made our dev systems a little less ugly.I went to work on other things for a few months.

There is always a reason to take them out (performance, potential user confusion, grumpy devs, whatever), but prioritizing them says a lot of good about the team and project.In most cases, in my experience, I can tell what generation an engineer comes from based on attitude to whimsy. Younger devs almost always don&#39;t like them. Too much effort, too much potential for trouble. Older devs, especially past retirement, almost always like them.

Without Ukraine, Russia ceases to be a Eurasian empire.”“However, if Moscow regains control over Ukraine, with its 52 million people and major resources as well as access to the Black Sea, Russia automatically again regains the wherewithal to become a powerful imperial state, spanning Europe and Asia.”"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"What is the endgame here?Russia is outclassed by NATO both economically and militarily.If NATO intervenes economically, Russia will lose much.If NATO intervenes militarily, Russia will lose much (but at great cost to NATO).The risk of NATO intervention is high, right? Russia understood this before invading, right? So it seems Russia is accepting a high risk of loss.But it doesn&#39;t make sense that a nation as sophisticated as Russia would accept such a high risk of loss. Which means that they might actually believe the risk of NATO intervention is low.How could the risk be low without some kind of collusion or hidden knowledge (hidden from us common folk)? Are &#34;they&#34; (&#34;the global elite&#34;, &#34;the military industrial complex&#34;) all &#34;in it&#34; (profiting) together? Is Russia just suicidal? If (when?)

The Canadian economy is larger than Russia&#39;s.  The combined economy of all of NATO is 25x the size of Russia&#39;s.  This does not even include Pacific allies like Japan and ANZUS.For historical perspective, when Japan attacked Pearl Harbor the US economy was 7x larger than theirs.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This looks like a decent deal looking deeper into it.Things that weren&#39;t obvious on first pass:(1) The VR specs are much higher than consumer level.  I suspect this is what makes it reasonable to read text on it.  The comparison headset is this: https://varjo.com/products/aero/  (They named it, but didn&#39;t google it)(2) They said &#34;VR Computer&#34; but don&#39;t define the term.  They mean that it&#39;s a full PC with a headset instead of a regular display.  Oddly they don&#39;t include a mouse or keyboard.My feedback for Simula one:(0) The value proposition here is (a) the included equipment and (b) the software.  They together have to justify the price at some level.(1) You have to really push the point that this is a full computer, not another headset.  I suggest you include a keyboard/mouse, and include it in the pictures with the headset (the pictures with just the headset, not the ones with the people).  Perhaps a keyboard with a trackpad.(2) Show that the headset is substantially higher-spec than the consumer ones.  Show a comparison chart.(3) Dump the AR coffee shop video.  Show AR in a home office.  Don&#39;t assume/require that your customers are that VR gun-ho.(4) Show more than a bunch of shells in the VR screenshots.  I can alt-tab as fast as I can move my head, with less work.  If this is your underlying value proposition, it sucks.  I&#39;m sorry.  If you have something more interesting, like a combined VR/app environment, then it can work.(4.1) Is there some useful interactions between 3D visualization and high-quality small-text rendering?  If you have good VR/3D developer stories, then this can work.(5) Simula One - is it Ubuntu with a 3d window manager and custom rendering stack?  Does it do anything else?  Does it just make a (claustrophobic) shell of windows around the user in VR?(5.1) Are there any integrations with anything?  Like https://blog.jupyter.org/ipygany-jupyter-into-the-third-dime... ipygany?(5.2) What do you expect people to do with it?

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I see people have issues with the price tag, and while it is by no mean cheap, since it&#39;s actually a full blown computer AND a VR headset all in one, it is somewhat justified. The computer specs match my Framework laptop and the headset is, on paper, on par or better than other high-end VR headsets (and a miles ahead of my Meta Quest 2 and other consumer-grade VR headsets)."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"So many people are complaining about price of a first gen enthusiast device.You know the Apple II (~1500 in 1977) is 5k in modern dollars, and sold over 5m units, right?If the device solves a genuine productivity problem for you, 3k is cheap."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The code design is also very elegant in its simplicity.You have two static lists of words in the JS code - known words, and a smaller, random pre-shuffled list of words the game will select from.The selection is done on the client, by date, from the second list - every day at midnight (your local time!) the next word in the pre-shuffled list is selected - no hashing or randomizing or anything. No cookies are involved in making you play one game per day, no server side calls are involved in gameplay at all. And yes, this means that changing your time zone will let you play tomorrow&#39;s game, and that you can just view source to know tomorrow&#39;s word - it appears right after today&#39;s word in the code.This is so counter to how we usually design software in so many ways, it&#39;s just delightful."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I actually think the OP and the comments are too focused on the programmer-related aspects of this. I&#39;ll add a few things.1. It&#39;s not trivial but it&#39;s not that hard if you have a decent vocabulary and some intuitive sense for word frequencies (and word pair frequencies) for different locations in a word. The answer list does not seem to include really hard words as naively picking all the words in the MW dictionary would be. It&#39;s a fun 10-15 minute puzzle.2. Five letter seems like something of a sweet spot.3. The answer word list does not appear to have a lot of plurals or common vowel endings for past tense, etc. Or obscure words.4. It lends itself to what I&#39;ll casual cheating, i.e. there are easy ways to get some hints without giving the answers away while focusing on a strategy.5. Basically, it&#39;s got good gameplay for a casual game. It would be easy to build something along similar lines that didn&#39;t have as fun gameplay for a casual gamer."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"One more factor in Wordle&#39;s popularity that I haven&#39;t yet seen commentators identify much. The game&#39;s word roster tilts heavily toward words with neutral or cheerful connotations.So your brain conjures up something happy at the end. You don&#39;t slog through the puzzle solving to end up with VIRUS, ENNUI, GRIEF, SLAVE, INANE or other such morose words.Instead, we get the likes of AWAKE, BLUSH, FOCAL, etc. That helps make the game a mood-stabilizer or even brightener. We&#39;re usually clever enough to find a solution most days. When we&#39;re slow and need all six turns, we get a cheery &#34;Whew!&#34; to console us. It&#39;s a simple, barely noticeable bit of gamification at its nicest."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Nearly all of these are approximately &#34;users did something they expected to work, but it didnt; shame on them&#34; or &#34;We chose a safe but mostly bad default, shame on users for not realizing it&#34;.I understand the rational for not changing old defaults in fear of breaking existing configs. However, maybe a release or two of deprecation or better optimized defaults under new names or a new (kinda gross but...) strict mode which is opt-in but is the new default for new instalations.1. Warn the user on startup of potential misconfiguration
2. Allow error_log off to work, as users are expecting it to
3. Enable keep alive by default
4. Acknowledge the confusing syntax and find a better solution than blaming users
5. Warn the user on startup of impact of proxy_buffering off
6. See 4
7. See 1
8. See 1
9. Fix the proxy hash algorithm so that it hashes the whole address (why only first 3 octets?) or give it a new name; see also 1
10. Detect possible optimizations on startup and implement automatically; why ask the user to config something that can potentially be detected automatically?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"My biggest gripe with nginx is the documentation. I ran into an issue with proxy_buffering being off yet I was still getting 502 errors because the upstream was passing too large headers for the default 4k buffers. I naively assumed that with proxy buffering off that it would send data to the client immediately and, y&#39;know, not buffer it, as [0] suggests. Turns out that turning proxy_buffering off doesn&#39;t turn proxy buffering completely off.While working on that issue, I also needed to set the proxy buffer size. Quick, what&#39;s the difference between proxy_buffer_size [1] and the size argument of proxy_buffers [2]? I still don&#39;t know, because the docs for each directive sound to me like they&#39;re restating the same exact thing.[0] https://nginx.org/en/docs/http/ngx_http_proxy_module.html#pr...
[1] https://nginx.org/en/docs/http/ngx_http_proxy_module.html#pr...
[2] https://nginx.org/en/docs/http/ngx_http_proxy_module.html#pr..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;m surprised the &#34;set a resolver with a dns ttl&#34; isn&#39;t on here; it&#39;s probably my only headache with nginx. If you have an upstream that you specify with a hostname, nginx will lookup the host, cache it, and never refresh it by default.I don&#39;t know why it happens to me so often, but I will set up nginx containers that proxy to some load balanced service (via DNS), and then one day the IPs will change and that service would break because I forgot to set resolver."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"One of the members of my team ordered a Framework Laptop, the Professional edition, about 4 months ago to replace his old Lenovo. In the first week, he had battery drain issues. Even when he put it to sleep, it would drain the battery. He had to keep it plugged in at all times. He tried few distros (including the older version of Ubuntu they recommend) and the problems persisted. His screen also had issues and colors would slightly shift. I lent him my colorimeter and he said the monitor would lose calibration after several days. He also complained about trackpad not tracking his finger properly. In the end, he returned it. I think he said you have 30 days to return it.Hope they fix these issues."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I kinda feel bad for Docker. The prevailing wisdom seems to be that you shouldn&#39;t be using Docker anymore, use Podman. Often the reasons for this is that Podman is daemonless, supports rootless containers, etc. But I feel this is misplaced:- The Docker daemon is actually really useful. It can run containers as other users, perform a bunch of mounting and networking stuff you can&#39;t do as rootless (or at least requires some hacky workarounds), and can monitor/maintain your containers. Podman can do lots of this as well, but requires the use of systemd. So in those cases you&#39;ve just swapped one daemon for another.- For most of my use cases, I don&#39;t really care about rootless. On servers I run all my docker containers as non-root anyway, and if I&#39;m on a workstation I have privileges and don&#39;t need rootless.- Although Podman claims compatibility with Docker, I&#39;ve always found issues with trying to use it even up to a few months ago, prior to this release. Mostly when trying to use compose, although it does improve every release.I basically just view the Docker daemon as an init system like systemd. It&#39;s a privileged daemon that runs other processes. But for some reason it seems to have been made into a bogeyman."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I really like Podman, and I&#39;m happy to see this new release. This little nugget about non-released features makes me most excited though:&gt; More features, including support for volume mounts from the host, are planned for Podman v4.1, so stay tuned for more updates.IIUC host volume mounts for podman-machine are the last major missing feature in Podman that would allow something like Podman Desktop Companion [1] to replace Docker Desktop on Windows/Mac for most use cases - if it works well. It&#39;d be great to replace that nagging-for-updates and nagging-for-subscriptions with a completely open source replacement tool. (I&#39;m sympathetic to the Docker team in need of a revenue source, but I&#39;m really happy OCI containers on Mac and Windows can be made accessible without vendor lock-in).[1]: https://iongion.github.io/podman-desktop-companion/"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Is there an eli5 or similar on the differences between podman / docker / rancher / others?Feels unexplained (at least for me), how do I know which to choose when and what are the trade offs?I recently went deeper on Rancher Desktop and it’s use of containerd vs dockerd backends and it is totally not obvious what you lose if not using dockerd and how you might fill the gaps. Feels like because docker established the space and put a bunch of related components together (cli, image building, image storing and container running) and other projects make difference choices it can be quite confusing to compare them."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"From the article:&#34;I often encountered videos that were uploaded again and again, no matter how many times I removed them. One day, a woman emailed me, calmly explained that her ex-boyfriend had uploaded a video of them having sex, and asked me to remove it. I deleted the clip. Later that week, it was re-uploaded. The woman wrote again, I removed it, and this continued for months; I must have pulled the same video down a dozen times. This was before I had ever heard the term “revenge porn.”Requests like this were not uncommon. Once, a woman wrote to say there was a video of her on Tube8 that showed her being sexually assaulted after someone spiked her drink at a party. The video had tens of thousands of views, so I had to review it before making the call to remove it. In the clip, the woman is clearly high, laughing and head lolling, having sex on a bed surrounded by fully dressed people holding drinks and watching as colored lights flashed and music blared in the background. I took it down, but it was uploaded again repeatedly in the following months. Each time, the mortified woman flagged it, and each time, I removed it; both of us were aware that there was nothing we could do to stop the clip from resurfacing.&#34;I have read the same thing from Facebook content moderators.  They got so frustrated at having to watch and take down the same videos over and over.This seems to be such a simple problem to solve:  record a hash of the video file, don&#39;t allow uploading it again.  That would probably get rid of most re-posting.It could be bypassed by modifying the file slightly, but the hashing could also get more sophisticated.  At some point, an ex-boyfriend is not likely to want to keep modifying a video to piss off his ex."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Be careful working in this field (pornography). In 2017 I wrote a mildly pornographic app (http://driftwheeler.com) and it appears on my resume. When hiring managers or recruiters take a look, some of them get upset.For example, a scheduled interview was abruptly cancelled the night before. I pursued the matter through a friend who had a senior role at the hiring company and it was determined that the (middle-aged female) in-house recruiter had been deeply offended when she followed the link on my resume and had cancelled everything. Eventually, I received a sincere apology from the CEO.There is a real stigma, and it will affect you. Beware."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; One day, I received inquiries from journalists looking to find out more about Manwin. Believing it was a major threat, I sent off a panicked email to the owner of the company and some vice presidents. My bosses were stunned, and not in a good way. Corey, the guy who had originally hired me, marched me into an office, and I nearly got canned. They had mercy on me. I think they could tell that I was trying to protect the company in my own overzealous, entirely inappropriate way. It was true — I felt like part of a team and wanted to do my best for them. But I had blown it.&gt; After that, with my reputation tarnished, my fortunes at the company started to dwindle.That seems wrong to me, but I&#39;m interested in other people&#39;s responses. It doesn&#39;t seem like &#39;blowing it&#39; at all. How many companies have problems with employees that are too motivated?First, afaik, CEOs generally work to have open lines of communication with their lower level employees - the problem is people not paying attention, not communicating important information, or it getting filtered by the interests of layers in between. Second, Manwin can&#39;t be that big a company. It&#39;s not like emailing the CEO of Microsoft, who has &gt;100,000 people working for them (and again, wouldn&#39;t Satya Nadella just say - &#39;hey, thanks for keeping a sharp eye out and for the heads up. It may look bad, but we&#39;ve seen it many times before. I&#39;m going to forward this to corporate communications, who can handle these things astutely.&#39;)Maybe other companies are just different than the ones I&#39;ve seen."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I fully agree with this. Scanning Google News or a couple of the more professional international news services like BBC / Al Jazeera / Reuters I still feel pretty well informed (and confident that there&#39;s usually nothing of immediate consequence to me) but it doesn&#39;t grow into &#34;expert analysis&#34; or impact my feelings much. Here&#39;s another thing I noticed: how manipulated / manipulative it is. And not just news and I don&#39;t just mean politically - I know everyone thinks that news that doesn&#39;t align with their politics is just brainwashing. Broadcast TV is just generally awful now IMO.We went quite a few years without ever seeing cable. My kids would stream shows and consume other media on-demand, but any advertising was minimal and fairly non-intrusive. And then they were watching a kids show at a hotel once and the ads came on and the effect it had on them was crazy. They suddenly desperately needed all the toys in the commercials and were repeating catch phrases from ads after only seeing them a couple of times. The contrast in their behavior was insane. And they HAD to keep watching it like I hadn&#39;t seen before. I spent a week off-grid with my parents a while back and it was great. We came home and my Mom put on the news suddenly everything was terrible and she was angry, but she had to keep watching.Just awful for mental health if you can&#39;t separate yourself from it."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"As someone who just stepped back into pop culture after being in prison for years (so might as well been on the moon) my first shock was just how horrible it all is now. There is no news worth watching. Cable news is just a pile of filth excremented by a Labrador Retriever that solely eats baby diapers. I thought I will watch Bloomberg since if real money is involved it can&#39;t be too manipulative. Nope, wrong. The internet is just a fireheap. Let&#39;s check Reddit. Oh god close the browser window immediately. WTF? Slashdot? Um, what is this, someone wearing a Slashdot skin suit? How about the sites by supposedly rational academics on each side of the political persuasion to get some balance. WTF? Just hate and anger and toxicity on a crazy level otherizing any opinion not their own. People are once thought great intellectual insides making incredibly uncharitable frankly hate filled comments and self isolating in echo chambers. Google Discovery app... &#34;here&#39;s some blog posts summarizing relationship posts made on Reddit&#34;. Huh? Why would anyone want to read this let alone have it further aggregated for them? Seriously, modern American discourse has less humanity, compassion, depth, and recognition of nuance THAN PRISON. Or maybe prison just made me less patient of bull crap and able to immediate horrible people by their mannerisms. Seriously this site is the only place I have found still sane and enlightening."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I strongly agree with this. I would, however, like to call out one TV program here in the U.S. that I think comes much closer to approximating the experience of “reading a 5,000-word article”: PBS NewsHour. It’s great, completely free and available to watch online, and you can even get most of what you need from their podcast alone (https://www.pbs.org/newshour/feeds/rss/podcasts/segments).It consists of fairly in-depth, thoughtful coverage of both domestic and worldwide news topics, as well as a tiny bit of political analysis on Mondays and Fridays. It almost never devolves into the breathless, “the world is about to end”-type coverage found on basically all cable news programs. Judy Woodruff and her team are really great. I dearly miss Gwen Ifill and Jim Lehrer.The Economist is also a great resource, as has been pointed out by other commenters here. They publish an audio edition of each week’s newspaper, too."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I avoid all things Samsung for a much more important reason: They spy on you mercilessly, up to about the same level as Facebook.For example, they take screenshots of what you watch on your Samsung Televisions!Don&#39;t believe me? Take it from them: https://www.samsung.com/us/business/samsungads/resources/tv-... and https://www.samsung.com/us/business/samsungads/insights/You&#39;re not their customer, you&#39;re the product.Additionally, Samsung have a habit of releasing forced updates that almost-but-not-entirely brick their TVs, slowing them down to molasses. They do this right before the next model becomes available for purchase.Last but not least, a colleague worked there as a consultant, and his stories of their lax IT security were nearly unbelievable. Even though they spy on you like Google or Facebook, they are not like a FAANG when it comes to protecting your private info! They&#39;ve been hacked for sure, probably by multiple nation state actors. Whatever you watch or do with their TVs is being relayed to the US, Russians, Chinese, or whomever. Assume that nothing you do with a Samsung device or Samsung software is remotely secure or safe.They&#39;re a slimy company made up of unscrupulous people trying to squeeze every last drop out of every rock.Don&#39;t give them your money. There are many other companies with much better track records."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I am truly, deeply, unsurprised that foldable phones fail along the seam.I know that&#39;s not the point of the post, and I&#39;m not blaming the author. It just seems like such a ridiculous concept in the first place. My old flip phone had its own problems, and there wasn&#39;t even a display along the seam."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"So the author had a folding phone that failed and couldn&#39;t get it repaired/replaced. The narrow take is that you&#39;re kinda crazy to buy a folding phone but Samsung was selling them so is really on the hook for the inevitable issues.The story of getting it fixed is really why people love Apple and even Amazon.I&#39;ve had the Wifi go unreliable on an iPad. I got a Genius appointment for later that day. They confirmed the Wifi module was shot and just gave me a new device on the spot. They even offered to do the transfer for me. This sort of convenience is what gives people confidence in buying Apple products.Even something as simple as accessory access matters. If my Macbook charger dies, I can walk into any number of stores and buy another. Dell charger? Not so much.Amazon has pretty accurate shipping estimates. This matters. So does Apple for the record. Just last week I got sent the wrong product. I didn&#39;t have to talk to anyone on the phone. I simply went to my order on my phone and clicked &#34;return item&#34; -&gt; &#34;wrong product&#34; and the entire matter was dealt with.I don&#39;t want to deal with support that is deliberately hard to contact that is monetarily motivated to not do anything for you."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I changed careers at 40+ years old.  I&#39;m very happy that I did it.People have all sorts of constructs / ideas about how careers work (based on experience) or how they think it works, or how they want it to work.   I talk to some college graduates who tell me what they&#39;re planning for and have ZERO clue what industry they&#39;re talking about, their description is unrecognizable to me ... even tho I know it is the one I work in.I find your experience and paths can vary greatly company to company, even job to job.We all find truths we want to hold on to about work.   I recall trips to the valley where my coworkers where astonished to hear tales of people doing the same work they did, but doing it slightly differently elsewhere in the country.  Their view of how that job was done was entirely shaped by the couple places they worked (and everyone seemed to cycle through those couple companies).   You&#39;d think these folks though that if you didn&#39;t fill out the TPS report right to left that the world would end... I&#39;m pretty sure the vast majority of people fill them out left to right but I didn&#39;t feel like telling them that, it might have been too much for them to handle.&#34;
I think there are three main kinds of career destination, at least in the tech industry:    Independent
    Senior individual contributor (IC)
    Management
&#34;I have no idea why those are the only destinations ... for an article worried about being happy that seems kind of limited.The whole article feels very pie in the sky to me."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&#34;It&#39;s not surprising, then, that many of us find ourselves in less than fully satisfying jobs, with doubtful or non-existent prospects for advancement.&#34;Very true. I can&#39;t wait for my career to be over. I don&#39;t think I&#39;ll ever find the position where I feel I belong, so I&#39;ll just be miserable anywhere now that I know how broken the system really is."</p>

Also volunteering/open source but mostly, not doing things I don&#39;t want to do any more. Yep, I don&#39;t want to be &#34;incredibly excited&#34; about the &#34;next growth chapter of my life&#34; - I just want to live my life in a non-agile way without sprinting towards the end of it.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&gt; The government’s action is troubling enough, but what should really disturb us is the ease and invisibility with which it is being done.This is such a great point. I&#39;m not sure why it needs to be made over and over again, but it seems that&#39;s the only way it doesn&#39;t get buried.Let&#39;s play a game. I will be the institution, you will be the person. You will get ability to record me with your cellphone and post stuff online to complain about various issues. I will get the ability to see all your financial transactions, listen to all your communications, track your location, arrest you when I don&#39;t like you recording me, smear you online and pressure companies to ban you from literally any service imaginable, including banking.Both of us will be bound by the legal framework, but when I don&#39;t like it, I will have the ability declare the state of emergency and scrap all the rules. Also, I will have sovereign immunity when I break the rules. Also, many of my actions will be secret because of national security.Oh, and I will be doing all the things described above using your money.Sounds fair?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Exactly correct.Anyone who is applauding this, just imagine the opposite political party in power using this against you or organizations you support.  This is why no one should have been happy when executive orders became the norm in the US and congress did nothing.  This is how you lose a senate and gain a Caesar, and look what happen to Rome eventually…Debanking someone who can now no longer pay for thier own defense is crazy overreach.  Absolute power corrupts absolutely."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The simple answer is to reject the cashless society.In the medium to long term it&#39;s simply incompatible with any reasonable definition of freedom. Surveillance is bad enough, but a system that allows governments to arbitrarily &#34;turn off&#34; thousands or millions of people at the push of a button is too powerful to not be abused.Even the mere existence of such a system has a chilling effect. Which I suspect is precisely what these people want and is exactly why we can&#39;t give it to them.I&#39;ll take inconvenience over slavery any day of the week.This isn&#39;t some sort of anarcho-libertarian paradise opinion, I have no issue with there being a well functioning justice system.But yeah, if you want to seize assets, get a court order and go and lock someone in a box and take their things, don&#39;t take the cowardly way out and pretend that you&#39;ve just flipped a database key and it&#39;s not really a big deal.By the same token, if you tell me there&#39;s been a murder on my street I&#39;ll give you the CCTV footage of my door cam. If you ask me for a backdoor, I&#39;ll tell you where to shove it. That&#39;s what being a member of a free society is, that seemingly minor distinction is one of the most important things we have and better minds than mine have sought to elaborate on why.Even a child is able to understand that force is still force regardless of whether it involves the direct visible physical kind."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I had the chance to work with a few people I&#39;d consider genius level.  While I&#39;m pretty smart myself, they all have something I don&#39;t always have:  The ability to be happy in any situation and interested in everything.For example, we were walking trough a hallway. On a wall is an old, damaged, ugly map of my country, half covered with graffiti.  I&#39;d walked past it almost every day for half a year.He checks it out, and starts noticing a lot of semi-interesting factoids about names, merged cities, obscure places, old mapping conventions, etc...  All of this with an absolute positive energy of pure interest.  We spent a fun hour just looking at it.  I should have known all this, and yet an hour with him makes me look at it with new eyes.Wherever he was, he instantly attracted a group of friends and wannabe girlfriends, and never really seemed to notice.  Same in this case:  There was a group of beautiful partygirls we&#39;d never met before, no nerdy interests at all, which accreted around the map in less than 5 minutes. They loved the situation just as much as us nerds did.I learned a lot from him, and try to follow this example, but I still can&#39;t do this today and am humiliated (in a positive way) by this way of living."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; we suggest that leaders follow the science and take a structured approach to hiring for, promoting, and developing employee happiness&gt; Measure happiness in both employees and job candidates.&gt; we conservatively advocate using measures of happiness and optimism as discriminators, or tiebreakers, because the risks are low and the benefits could be important.Good luck getting a job, unhappy people…I don’t think they have the evidence to make this recommendation, since they surveyed people already employed (by the US army), who may have been unhappier pre employment.&gt; might dismiss these results if you believe that military data somehow doesn’t apply to the business world, but you would be wrong to do so. After all, the U.S. Department of Defense is the single largest employer in the worldTheir entire argument for this also applying outside the military domain seems to be that the military is a very large employer… However, is not the military a vastly different environment from normal civilian workplaces?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Reading these comments is forehead slap inducing. People think that just because something is mental that it has to do with your mindset, your parents, your this your that.When a dude can run faster than other people, it’s written off as genetics. When someone is resilient to depression, it’s anything other than genetics. Both cases are the same: it’s just biological.I’ve been suffering super hard with depression recently and it’s made something clear to me: your mindset is bullshit. It might tip things one way or another but the actual mechanisms of depression will change your life. Everyone will be super humbled when we figure out how to turn off depression, and everyone gets it and everyone experienced on average a 50% boost to their intelligence and productivity. They will be humbled because they will realize that all of that relative suffering was totally pointless and for no other reason than a quirk of evolution. And that some people had it good for absolutely no reason. But it’s exciting to know that this day will come and it can’t come fast enough for me!"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Cool demonstration of regular expression power!
Note that as implemented, this is a space bounded Turing Machine with a hardcoded tape length limit:&gt; With the current implementation, the read/write head looks at the 22nd element of the tape whenever we want to read the current position. With complicated machines that utilize long lengths of the tape, you would need to increase this number so that you never delete a necessary tape element as you scroll along it. This can be done by increasing the {20} that appears at the beginning of the expression.Embedding the tape head pointer ^ within the tape, just to the left of the scanned bit, should remove this restriction."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"   The instruction sets are the remaining lines, formatted like &gt;C.I:WMN
   C current instruction name.
   I the input from the current tape position. Either 0 or 1. Each instruction has 
   execution parameters for both inputs.
   W the output to be written to the tape at the current position. Either 0 or 1.
   M the movement of the read/write head. A 0 moves the head one position to the 
   left. A 1 moves it to the right.
   N the name of the next instruction to be executed at the new tape position.

Would it have been clearer to use &#34;&lt;&#34; or &#34;&gt;&#34; to specify whether to move left/right from the current position?"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;ve seen a lot of commentary about the fact that the Emergencies Act provisions &#34;expire&#34; automatically after 30 days, and include &#34;safeguards&#34;, ergo there&#39;s nothing worry about. People getting hung up on the text of the bill forget that it&#39;s merely an Act of Parliament, and thus can easily be amended or replaced via a simple majority vote.What played out last night indicates that none of these checks and balances really matter in a parliamentary system where the nuclear option of a non-confidence vote (and subsequent election) can be invoked to force any MPs with qualms to vote along party lines.It&#39;s easy to see what will happen next, based on this government&#39;s track record: they will introduce amendments to the Act, or new legislation containing only the provisions they would like to make permanent, and once again proclaim that voting against the amendment will result in a new election.They will probably also use it as an excuse to ram through their &#34;Online Harms Bill&#34;, i.e. internet censorship, targeted at &#34;misinformation&#34; (disagreeable speech) and, many suspect, independent media outlets that the PM despises.Internet censorship + government-directed financial de-platforming = Canada&#39;s near-term future if the situation doesn&#39;t change somehow."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Occupy Wall Street was started by a group of organized Canadians and they blocked access to NYSE facilities. OWS was obviously an occupation (it’s right there in the name), but the better question is: was OWS a protest, too? If so, why can’t this be called one as well?There are generally more parallels between OWS and the truckers than people are willing to recognize, because there’s been a hell of an inversion: if you supported OWS 10 years ago you probably don’t like the truckers today and if you like the truckers you probably weren’t for OWS 10 years ago. There are a handful of Tim Pools that like both, and there are elites that disliked both, but the average person has to do some gymnastics.All that I ask is that everyone is consistent: if OWS is a protest, then this is too. If you don’t like that Americans funded the truckers, you have to be willing to call out that OWS took place in NYC but formed from a Canadian nonprofit."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"A related report from the BBC (published a few days ago):Europe gas prices: How far is Russia responsible? https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/58888451Some key points in the BBC article:- Russia supplies about 40% of the EU’s natural gas imports. Most of the rest comes from Norway and Algeria.- Russia sends gas to Europe through several main pipelines - such as the Nord Stream, the Yamal-Europe and the Brotherhood (see the map in the article).- Overall, Russian gas exports to Europe have been decreasing over the last couple of years - down 32% in February this year compared to February 2020. One factor - during the pandemic - has been falling demand as economic activity shrank. Stocks of gas across Europe have been depleted, which in turn is driving up prices.- Gazprom, Russia&#39;s majority state-owned energy company, supplies gas to Europe under two different arrangements: 1. Long-term contracts often lasting from 10 to 25 years. 2. &#34;Spot&#34; deals or one-off purchases for a fixed amount of gas.- It is understood that Gazprom met its obligations to European buyers last year under these contracts.- &#34;Spot&#34; sales don&#39;t appear to be happening in any significant quantity, going by data from Gazprom&#39;s own electronic sales platform.- The International Energy Agency&#39;s executive director, Fatih Birol, has accused Russia of reducing gas supplies to Europe for political purposes.- Gas storage across Europe is well below the 10-year average, with levels currently at about 75% of storage capacity, according to Gas Infrastructure Europe data."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"That is not remotely pulling the plug. This is &#34;thinking about it&#34; again. They already stopped accreditation a few weeks ago, otherwise it would already transport gas as the pipeline is already filled. They just say that they have officially stopped the process which they more or less already did. I think in a year it might come online again if the news cycle is on another topic.Overall it will be much more expensive for Europe than for Russia. Who do you think will profit the most if gas prices hike?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Here&#39;s some quick numbers I just googled to understand the big picture.This pipeline has an annual capacity of 55 billion cubic meters. It&#39;s the same capacity as the Nord Stream 1, which is already in operation. If Germany was truly meaning business, they&#39;d stop Nord Stream 1 the moment Russian boots enter Ukrainian territory. But let&#39;s leave that aside.55 billion cubic meters translate to about 0.6 billion MWh. The price today for natural gas Dutch TTF futures is EUR 78/MWh [1] , so that translates in about 40 billion EUR per year.  It has been as low as EUR 13 and as high as EUR 165 over the last 2 years. It&#39;s quite likely that Russia would make a profit even at the lower range, so the 40 billion EUR/year is pretty much pure profit for them.[1] https://www.theice.com/products/27996665/Dutch-TTF-Gas-Futur..."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Thank goodness. Bethesda&#39;s launcher was uniquely awful in a number of unpleasant ways. Slow, prone to crashes, bad user communication, not suitable for use on small monitors. The worst of the launcher apps I have used - and there are so many!I remember when it was in vogue for every game maker to build their own launcher or even full Steam clone - when EA pulled all its new games from Steam to get people to use Origin, when Ubisoft forced uPlay on you no matter how you bought the game, and so on. Now, it seems like we&#39;re pulling back from that situation somewhat - a lot of EA games are back on Steam, for example.I wonder whether the experiment didn&#39;t work, or if it worked, but now the goals have changed again?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Is there a technical reason why Steam is a such a force in the space? People, myself certainly included, often criticize Apple for taking 30% of developer revenue for merely existing in it&#39;s walled garden. Right or wrong, they control the ecosystem, so their ability to monopolize and heavily tax the App Store is unsurprising, they&#39;re exercising their pricing power as much as they possibly can.But how is it that on PC, where we have a mostly open field on which anyone can participate freely without a gatekeeper&#39;s blessing, Steam managed to consolidate so much of the gaming marketplace that even a titan like Microsoft is throwing the towel and bowing to Steam&#39;s cartelish 30%? I get that being the dominant two-sided marketplace of a given space is a strong network effect and moat, and consolidation is certainly convenient for users (I like having all my purchased games on a single account), but intuition tells me Bethesda doesn&#39;t need Steam&#39;s exposure to sell games or make new arrivals known (their announcement will go viral regardless), similarly to Riot, Mojang, Epic and co not listing on Steam. So I&#39;ve always found it surprising they were dual listing their games in the first place, but the fact they&#39;re now entirely giving up on direct selling is a testament to Steam&#39;s might in the gaming industry.Is Steam&#39;s product particularly good and hard to reproduce from the publisher&#39;s PoV, even one backed by Microsoft, to the extent it is hard to compete against with something like Microsoft Store? Or is this just another case of being early enough to establish the initial brand and let the self-fulfilling network effect kick in - with the userbase acting like gravity to bring in more users and developers - until it&#39;s large enough that sheer force of habit/inertia makes it quasi-&#34;indisruptible&#34;?Either way, I found it fascinating how Valve turned into Steam, whether it was accidental or not, what a homerun pivot. Seems that is the way of the Internet, being first matters more than just about anything, having the superior product (not claiming there is one for game stores) is irrelevant if you&#39;re remotely late, it just won&#39;t matter how much cash you pour into a Microsoft Store or a Google+. My gut tells me Microsoft is salivating at the idea of buying out Steam, seems like a perfect fit for the conglomerate if it wasn&#39;t for the scrutiny it would bring their way while they are positioning themselves as the good FAAMG."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"As a matter of principle, I think digital delivery platforms benefit from competition, and we should not be locked down into a single monopolistic, stagnating platform.As a selfish consumer though, I hugely wish we just had Steam and Netflix:The Origins and Uplays and Battle.nets of the world exist solely to make my life difficult, refusing to play my game when I want it due to obscure update required or forgotten password or old email account (especially when they are an overlay on top of Steam), and have zero repeat zero positively zero benefit to myself as a consumer. It is blatantly anti-consumer, and not made with customer view in mind.(Gog.com gets a pass because it allows me to JUST download the game, with no launcher and crap, so essentially going into opposite direction from all publisher-owned platforms and provides a unique value proposition)Same for Netflix.  It&#39;s fine. It&#39;s good. It&#39;s great! Over the last 5 years, proliferation of Disneys, Amazons, HBOs, Hulus, CBS All Access, Paramount Ultra Plus Exclusive Diamond Platinum... the whatEVERs, all they do is make me have to guess which  service is content I want to play on. All they are, at any level, is &#34;we want more money for less consumer convenience, and we think we can get away with it due to exclusive content lock-in we refuse to license to the convenient platform&#34;.I understand I&#39;m supposed to vote with my money, but with exclusive lock-in that&#39;s difficult. My kid wants their Octonauts and their Stinky &amp; Dirties, dammit :D"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I always liked the embedded system model where you get flash hardware that has two operations -- erase block and write block.  GC, RAID, error correction, etc. are then handled at the application level.  It was never clear to me that the current tradeoff with consumer-grade SSDs was right.  On the one hand, things like the error correction, redundancy, and garbage collection don&#39;t require the attention from CPU (and more importantly, doesn&#39;t tie up any bus).  On the other hand, the user has no control over what the software on the SSD&#39;s chip does.  Clearly vendors and users are at odds with each other here; vendors want the best benchmarks (so you can sort by speed descending and pick the first one), but users want their files to exist after their power goes out.It would be nice if we could just buy dumb flash and let the application do whatever it wants (I guess that application would be your filesystem; but it could also be direct access for specialized use cases like databases).   If you want maximum speed, adjust your settings for that.  If you want maximum write durability, adjust your settings for that.  People are always looking for that one size fits all use case, but it&#39;s hard here.  Some people may be running cloud providers and already have software to store that block on 3 different continents.  Some people may be an embedded system with a fixed disk image that changes once a year, with some temporary storage for logs.  There probably isn&#39;t a single setting that gets optimal use out of the flash memory for both use cases.  The cloud provider doesn&#39;t care if a block, flash chip, drive, server rack, availability zone, or continent goes away.  The embedded system may be happy to lose logs in exchange for having enough writes left to install the next security update.It&#39;s all a mess, but the constraints have changed since we made the mess.  You used to be happy to get 1/6th of a PCI Express lane for all your storage.  Now processors directly expose 128 PCIe lanes and have a multitude of underused efficiency cores waiting to be used.  Maybe we could do all the &#34;smart&#34; stuff in the OS and application code, and just attach commodity dumb flash chips to our computer."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&gt; It is obvious that Swift has outgrown my influence, and some of the design premises I care about (e.g. &#34;simple things that compose&#34;)As someone who was heavily invested in Swift, and an active member of the community from around 2015-2019, I&#39;m a bit sad to see the direction the language is taking.From the time I started experimenting with Swift, I absolutely loved the philosophy of the language.  It seemed to really prioritize having a set of well-factored systems, each with their own very rationally designed interfaces, which could be composed to do really powerful things.  It was an incredibly expressive language which allowed for writing code with an incredible level of clarity - when writing Swift code I always felt I was writing at the level of the problem domain, not writing syntax.  At the same time it offered really nice features for ensuring safety and correctness, like ADT&#39;s and best-in-class nullability syntax.It was a language which sometimes seemed to move at a glacial pace, but the implicit tradeoff was that when a feature landed, it was for the most part very well thought out, and would add to the language with minimal negative impact.A few years ago that seemed to start to change.  From my perspective, some of the features added to the language to support SwiftUI - specifically property wrappers and function builders - very much felt rushed and forced into the language based on external deadlines.  And imo they have a largely negative impact on the language: it used to be the case that you could look at a piece of Swift code and roughly understand how it would compile to assembly pretty easily, but with these new features there&#39;s a ton of compiler magic going on behind the scenes."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I clicked on this thread because I knew exactly what I wanted to comment about, and was surprised to see that Chris mentioned exactly it in his message:&gt;After several discussions generating more heat than light, when my formal proposal review comments and concerns were ignored by the unilateral accepts, and the general challenges with transparency working with core team, I decided that my effort was triggering the same friction with the same people, and thus I was just wasting my time.I stopped paying attention to Swift for this exact reason. I have actually submitted and implemented a feature in Swift and I think it was one of my most frustrating experiences with open-source projects. It seems that almost every thread in this forum devolves into people fighting over the most irrelevant details, and my proposal specifically took months to be submitted into review because a couple of users simply refused to back down from how they personally wanted it to work, ignoring the actual problem the feature aimed to solve. After a long time deflecting the comments, the feature was accepted the way I originally intended and I never entered the forum again.Example aside, it doesn&#39;t take a proposal to see that almost every thread in the forum looks like this. Open sourcing Swift has benefits, but I think when it comes to the actual progress of the project, this particular democratic process was a mistake."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Key takeaway for me was the note that it “definitely isn’t a community designed language”. This is telling, I’ve watched a lot of neat languages over the years and absolutely none of the ones without community involvement have grown beyond the sphere of influence of their primary companies.I like swift enough I’m learning it to build my own personal tech nerd ideal podcast client because I own apple devices and want an app that works between macOS, iOS, iPadOS, tvOS,and watchOS. but I doubt I’ll ever use it for anything beyond this one personally motivated project. Even if i release it as an app on the store for download or purchase I don’t know if I will ever be motivated enough to build anything else using it. Because the scope is too narrow. Business work is converging on open stacks like react, and angular, and the dark horse of C# with its latest release supporting WASM web components backed by GRPC-web and a C# function driven stack from front to back, even without SQL Server costs this is a compelling ecosystem backed by PostgreSQL and other completely open source tools.But Swift remains Apple’s language for apple stuff and… while a profitable niche, it’s still a niche.Edit: typo fix."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Validation on holdout sets.When I was a student in the 1990s, I was taught about hypothesis testing (and all the hassle of p-fishing etc.), and about Bayesian inference (which is lovely, until you have to invent priors over the model space -- e.g. a prior over neural network architectures). These are both systems that tie themselves in epistemological knots when trying to answer the simple question &#34;What model shall I use?&#34;Holdout set validation is such a clean simple idea, and so easy to use (as long as you have big data), and it does away with all the frequentist and Bayesian tangle, which is why it&#39;s so widespread in ML nowadays.It also aligns statistical inference with Popper&#39;s idea of scientific falsifiability -- scientists test their models against a new experimental data, data scientists can test their model against qualitatively different holdout sets. (Just make sure you don&#39;t get your holdout set by shuffling, since that&#39;s not what Popper would call a &#34;genuine risky validation&#34;.)The article mentions Breiman&#39;s &#34;alternative view of the foundations of statistics based on prediction rather than modeling&#34;. Breiman does make a big deal of evaluation on holdout sets; but his &#34;prediction&#34; idea isn&#39;t general enough, since it doesn&#39;t accommodate generative modelling (e.g. GPT, GANs). I think it&#39;s better to frame ML in terms of &#34;evaluating model fit on a holdout set&#34;, since that accommodates both predictive and generative modelling."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Off-the-cuff, i.e. without digging deeply into a set of history of statistics books:Tied 1st place:• Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) and the Metropolis–Hastings algorithm• Hidden Markov Models and the Viterbi algorithm for most probable sequence in linear time• Vapnik–Chervonenkis theory of statistical learning (Vladimir Naumovich Vapnik &amp; Alexey Chervonenkis) and SVMs4th place:• Edwin Jaynes: maximum entropy for constructing priors (borderline: 1957)Honorable mentions:• Breiman et al.&#39;s CART (Classification and Regression Trees) algorithm (and Quinlan&#39;s C5.0 extension)• Box–Jenkins method (autoregressive moving average (ARMA) / autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) to find the best fit of a time-series model to past values of a time series)(The beginning of the 20th century was much more fertile in comparison - Kolmogorov, Fisher, Gosset, Aitken, Cox, de Finetti, Kullback, the Pearsons, Spearman etc.)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is a side issue, but I wonder what changes could be made to the teaching of statistics, most importantly &#34;stats for scientists&#34; taught in college and even high school. What occurs to me right off the bat is that I learned stats by the use of formulas to boil data sets down to answers. For example, null hypothesis significance testing and the dreaded p-value. We had to do it this way, as widespread availability of computers was still on the horizon.Today, computation is easy and cheap. I wonder if we could learn stats in a different way, perhaps starting by just playing with data, and simulated random numbers, graphing, and so forth. Can something like null hypothesis testing be taught primarily through bootstrapping, with the formulas introduced as an aside?Yes I know that statistics is a formal branch of math, with theorems and proofs. I took that class. But the students who take &#34;stats for scientists&#34; don&#39;t ever see that side of it. Understanding the formulas without seeing the proofs is like trying to learn freshman physics without calculus."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I love the idea of nix but the inconsistency and developer experience is terrible.   I want to suggest people use it but there is too many rough edges currently.For example, if you want to install a package the old way, you&#39;ll install it including the channel:    nix-env -iA nixpkgs.ripgrep


but then if you want to remove one, you don&#39;t reference the channel:    nix-env -e ripgrep

You have a similar issue if you want to use the new `nix` command.  To install a package you&#39;ll do:    nix profile install nixpkgs#ripgrep


but running:    nix profile remove nixpkgs#ripgrep


will do nothing.  It won&#39;t say &#34;I didn&#39;t remove the package&#34; or &#34;package not found&#34;.  It just returns silently.    The only way to remove it is to point to the number from `nix profile history` or the actual path.It is unbearably slow:    &gt; time nix-env -qaP ripgrep
    nixpkgs.ripgrep  ripgrep-13.0.0

    11.17s user 2.70s system 73% cpu 18.970 total


Overall I love the idea but it has a long way to go in developer experience and quality before it is ready for any mainstream adoption."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"  &gt; Nix often scares newcomers and experienced devs alike, because it proposes a fairly radical overhaul to how we think about package management and how we run software in general.

I am not sure this is the main put-off of nix.Ideologically, I love nix. The syntax/language itself is a massive barrier IMO.I use Nix for personal projects, but I prefer the experience of Devcontainers. They&#39;re easier to understand and debug (for me).I&#39;m watching eagerly the work being done by the ostree/rpm-ostree folks who are also trying to solve for a similar problem. Hoping to see something like &#34;Nix but with YAML/JSON&#34; come out of that.https://ostree.readthedocs.io/en/stable/manual/related-proje..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I have been running NixOS and uxing Nix for almost everything since I switched to it, and my experience has been great so far. It is one versatile solution to a lot of applications:1. I run NixOs on on laptop and workstation, for work and for personal use. Any change to the configuration can be immediately transfered to other machines. And give me a new machine, I can quickly bring it up with the configuration that I am always using.
2. I run NixOS on my home server and machine learning cluster. Deploy experiment and service on them is as simple as updating the git-managed configurations. Meanwhile, if I want to use more power to run an experiment, NixOps can quickly bring up a set of machines on AWS with the configuration identical to my local experiment. You do not need to worry about setting up CUDA/pytorch and other dependencies every.
3. In my start-up, it definitely took more time to train the developers to learn Nix, but once they get familiar, everyone becomes a good DevOps engineer, which solves development environemnt (that invloves C++/Python), CI/CD and release really well."</p>

For example, their techniques that &#34;always work&#34; definitely do not always work. Maybe they always worked for their particular babies, but I have been in situations with my kids where neither shushing and patting nor holding and walking worked to stop crying.My general feeling is that you can drive yourself nuts trying to figure out why your baby is crying, and, as the blog author mentioned in his conclusion, you may still be unable to figure it out. IMO this is a great time of one&#39;s life to discard the illusion of control."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Of kids I&#39;ve always thought &#34;maybe one day&#34;.  I can see how it&#39;d be a tough, but extremely rewarding and meaningful endeavor.But reading this article made me think for the first time &#34;actually, I think I don&#39;t want kids.&#34;So many &#34;mental CPU cycles&#34; spent learning about pregnancy, babies, why they cry, how to care for them.  It just doesn&#39;t appeal to me at all - I think it&#39;d resent it taking me away from spending time on the topics that legitimately interest me -   stuff like space, technology, fiction, stocks, politics, philosophy, hobbies.  (I realize how much this comes off as a young white tech nerd... But that&#39;s exactly what I am!)And all this just of the knowledge gathering.  We haven&#39;t even touched on the truly hard part - executing it!I guess this article made raising a kid real in a way that none other have before.  Took the high ideal of &#34;raising a family&#34; and shined light on all the tough, hard realities.Of course this is all from my current perspective.  I&#39;m sure it all totally changes in ways I just can&#39;t conceive when it&#39;s your own kid.Open to any insights from others who may have been here before!"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Newly minted dad of twins and uncle for 5 others.Infant phaseThe work is intense when they are young since they can’t do much on their own and need help very often. But this doesn’t last for too long. Most parents exaggerate this phase since it is very intense from their otherwise happy days without kids. I had enough nephews and nieces around that I helped with so my kids are not the first time I am doing something this intense.Toddler phaseThey are very manageable because of their size. Not those helpless poor little things any more. But they need to be entertained. Having others kids help a lot here. One more reason to have more than one kids. Only kids can match kids energy level.Beyond infantsThis is when things get interesting they start engaging with you a lot with words and actions.Most of the problems with millennials for fear of having kids got to do with not having much experience before having their own. So they get overwhelmed, this is very specific to societies with lack of communities (western urban societies).Once your friends have kids they are out of your circle since they cannot come out and do as much as they used to do.With medical advancements and tools available to raise a child it is lot easier to raise kids than before. Over focusing on parenthood is also another issue. This is product of abundance of time and money. My mom of 3 children didn’t have tools and time to engage with us like our generation do. She did exceptionally well without over indulging in the name of parenthood.Note: I am leaning game development and reading books while having full time job and having twins as my first children on my own at 40.It’s totally doable. Try being around your friends with kids, that’s helpful for them as well as you.Most rewarding thing and easily attainable for most of us is to raise children never forget the entertainment and stress buster aspect of having kids as well.Once a wise women from the east said to us raised in the west: If you can have pets I don’t seem to understand your issues having kids. Kids are Pets+++"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I feel like we have so much leverage and don&#39;t use it at all.We&#39;re still attending stand-ups every day with non programmers telling us when we can and cannot refactor. It&#39;s nuts to me that a skilled profession - that not many can do - lets themselves get micro-managed like this.If anyone has read Developer Hegemony, I&#39;m fully on board with that general premise - we start operating like lawyers with partnerships, and turn bosses into customers. Though that does require us to think of ourselves as professionals not nerds who are too smart for business."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I think it ends with everyone becoming a developer.Making machines do things will never end. However, the tools for making machines do things is evolving very quickly.The general art of being a developer will continue to get specialized and at some point specialists at any field would be expected to be able to program their machines.Very few people are learning how to run their servers and much more are moving into AWS type of infrastructure and “cloud literacy” has become a thing.I would expect layers of abstraction to continue to build up and programming to become something like using spreadsheets to do your actual task.Eventually, “true programming” will scale back to building these tools. It would be rather niche, very high skill serious engineering - an elite, hard to get in profession that continues to fetch high salaries. They probably will have some kind of association similar to the lawyers/doctors, the code they write will no longer tolerate bugs as a fact of life but they will be responsible as any other licensed professionals. Skipping unit test will land you in jail or very high fine due to malpractice if something goes wrong."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Programmers are increasingly needed for *everything*.I mean, we&#39;ve entered an age, where a farmer can&#39;t milk their cows, if the software of the milking robot has a hitch - can&#39;t plow their fields, when the gps-software that drives the tractor isn&#39;t working.Apart from that, programming is becoming every other job - as far as domain knowledge is concerned.I&#39;ve personally experienced (multiple times!) professional accounting companies complaining about not being able to just modify official invoices (totally illegal) but having to cancel and re-issue them with a new invoice number (how it MUST be done).
-&gt; It&#39;s now the responsibility of the programmers to understand how accounting works. Professional accountants just click a button and expect the software to &#34;do the right thing&#34;.
-&gt; As in this case, the professional accountant no longer adds much value, they&#39;ll probably be entirely replaced by software at some point.A more relatable example might be Taxis drivers. It might take years still, but at some point, all Taxis will be self-driving vehicles, created by robots in a fully automated factory. Programmers will be needed for the driving software and the factory software. You might still need some mechanics to repair the factory robots - until when that job is done by robots as well (that have to be programmed).It currently seems more likely to me, that we are headed towards a future, where programming is the *only* job - and everything else is done by software."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"An interesting quick dive into how some of the artifacts of historical implementations can carry forward decades later. I&#39;m saving this one. While everyone on HN is probably familiar with a pile of examples of this in our own work particularly if you do anything lower level, this is a nice example because it&#39;s really easy to grasp even for total non-programmers and gives a feel for the layers upon layers the digital world is built on. Details on the x86-64 bootstrap sequence are interesting to tech people but this is the sort of thing I might show in a school class.That said at first I thought the author was being a bit tongue in cheek on the suggestion to fix it with:&gt;A downside to making any changes is that the badly formatted GIFs won&#39;t render any more. I reckon just be bold, like the release of Netscape 2.0...If Netscape was fine with breaking poorly-made GIFs, we should be too!But we kind of have a bit more content now then when Netscape 2 was released, and it seems they&#39;re serious?  Support more than 256 colours in a single frame of GIF animation
  Support fast GIFs (10ms delay)
  No confusing behaviour with small delay = slow GIF
  Better compression for GIFs with multiple small areas updated per frame

But frankly at this point why? We&#39;ve got good universally adapted image formats that do more than 256 colors. We&#39;ve got webm and so on (even Apple caved on that one in the end) for baked animation which is much smaller and more powerful than gif, and plenty of CPU and libraries for generation on the fly. We&#39;ve got powerful ways to do animation purely with HTML/CSS/SVG/JS. GIF is a historical artifact with a lot of its value at this point purely about old things. This wouldn&#39;t even retroactively bring newer capabilities to older systems because it would require updated code which by definition means the ability to run new browsers and thus modern capabilities.I get they really enjoy hacking on gif but come on. Only way I can see it working is if all the players agreed on some metadata that could be added to gifs which wanted &#39;standards&#39; vs &#39;historical&#39; playback with the default remaining historical, and potentially also make it a browser setting. That&#39;d still leave the ad issue, but maybe at this point that&#39;s moot given the advancements in blockers (and it&#39;d be a very easy thing to look for as an indication of an ad, and thus be selected against)."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I like the ”Internet Explorer 5 is closed source, but could hypothetically look something like this” bit.Is this source code available through MS partnership programs or an old leak?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Rate limiting or clamping &#34;0&#34; delays upwards can also help for polling applications where you want to be as fast as possible, but you&#39;re never going to be actually zero. For example if you have a thread that&#39;s pulling images from a camera (publishing at 30 fps) in a loop, you can delay for 1ms between polls and nobody is going to know, but that can have an enormous impact on CPU usage; especially on embedded platforms. Instead of running at 100% thread usage (calling camera.read() and waiting for it to return true), the spin/loop cost is basically free and you only need to worry about the cost of acquiring/decoding the frame. In theory branch prediction should help because you&#39;ll take the &#34;no image yet&#34; branch 99% of the time, but in practice that just makes the loop iterate faster. I learned this the hard way writing a custom camera publisher in ROS, but I&#39;ve seen it a lot in tutorial code and I think a lot of beginners make that mistake."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Sometimes the initial rotation hides a part of the shape.Also, I have always wondered if there&#39;s a way to translate these shapes to strings for quick &#34;mental algorithm&#34; matching. Something like, &#34;5, left turn, 3, right turn...&#34;I guess you&#39;d need a normal form. The first turn can be defined as always &#34;right&#34; or &#34;left,&#34; and subsequent turns can be right, left, up or down. The first turn that&#39;s &#34;up&#34; or &#34;down,&#34; can be defined as &#34;up.&#34; That leaves two ways to read any shape, but that&#39;s an uhh constant-factor overhead. :)(I can&#39;t think of a way to define a normal form reading direction that wouldn&#39;t involve potentially reading an arbitrary distance in before having to re-start the other way.)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"IMO this would be more enjoyable if the shapes were more different morphologically, and fewer (ideally no) close pairs which differ only in the length of a segment by a single block.After the first couple of wrong guesses (though I&#39;m pretty sure one guess was correct - could be the bug https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=30408567) I started to count segment lengths rather than relying on mental shape rotation."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"As careful as some of the things he suggests are...if you&#39;re truly wanted by a state-level actor or sufficiently motivated attacker, you won&#39;t be able to hide by simply using VPN and Tor. Especially if you&#39;re running something with many transactions like AlphaBay. You would need to obfuscate quite a bit more:- if you&#39;re using VPN traffic but most people &#34;around&#34; you aren&#39;t, you&#39;re a suspicious node; your ISP could easily flag you to your government. If you use wifi at a common point you&#39;re likely to be flagged and there isn&#39;t an easy way other than keeping on the move. But moving often is another anomalous event, and it&#39;s very difficult to do even for Drug Lords ( El Chapo ) or Terrorists that it behooves to do. This puts you in a sort of Zugzwang, to borrow a chess term.- there&#39;s always leakage, for instance, in the way you talk with people in the real world. At some point you send enough communication for sophisticated frequency analysis.- and there are other patterns of usage that could be used to identify you, like searches or even keyboard frequency on anonymized accounts can be de-anonymized by very specific markers ( ML works! ).- off ramps for crypto aren&#39;t very good. If you&#39;re in e.g. Brazil, haha, yeah, good luck spending bitcoin or any other crypto and going unnoticed. Mixers and tumblers will eventually leak and you&#39;ll be caught.- you&#39;re very vulnerable to social engineering by people you do business with. one slip where you stop communicating in a transactional mode of communication and that&#39;s a weak link in your armor.In the end, the FBI only has to be right once, and you have to be right every time."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Or you can just be a known drug lord, launder billions of USD through a respected  international bank, no one goes to jail, small fine, and they&#39;re probably still laundering 10 years later and no one cares. No one is anonymous. They&#39;re probably all using SMS and corporate email.Sell a little bit of drugs through the silk road and you&#39;ll get royally f-ed! Sell all the opioids in the world through a public pharma corp and you can keep enjoying your jet-set life and yacht.The allegedly smartest people in the world are focusing on the dumbest problems while being reamed by the frat-boys that went to Wall Street and Politics, guns and drugs. LULZ."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"It&#39;s good advice. The problem with anonymity in an environment of ubiquitous surveillance is that it&#39;s paradoxical. The point of anonymity is achieving freedom, but staying anonymous expends energy and makes you a target, so you can&#39;t actually do any things that anonymity was supposed to get you.If what you really want is sovereignty, which is what most people confuse anonymity with,  the goal is to be like what Ernst Jünger called the anarch (in contrast to the anarchist), which is someone who complies and renders herself indifferent to authority, rather than standing out and drawing attention.A much better practice is to be as open as possible about the boring stuff, so you&#39;re not constrained and can do what everyone else does. Trying to be absolutist about anonymity is automatically like wearing a straitjacket."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"This kind of data collection abuse is why I think we need more addons like AdNauseam [1].

I don&#39;t have the time or energy to block JavaScript and/or manually inspect each domain&#39;s requests to figure out if they use server-side tracking or not.I honestly don&#39;t know if there&#39;s any solution to this at all.

When you’re trying to scale from 0 to 1 user then everything should help you explore the user’s problem space, even if it seems backwards to build the UI before the backend."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"That shouldn&#39;t be a surprise. At an old job with far smaller user base, we used to do something very similar and while the shadow profiles were not materialized in the form of actual profiles, the amount of data you can gather about someone just by having his/her number pop up in the contact list of several of your actual users is staggering: full name, workplace, city/neighborhood where they live, their partners, their hobbies and all sorts of things which you generally should not know. And we are not talking people who have their entire life published online, but people with little to no online visibility. Assuming that facebook is not doing something similar considering that their main business comes from profiling and modeling user behavior is just naive."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Facebook also has shadow profiles for non-users that connect directly to name, email address, and/or phone number.  At the very least these seem to be populated when people share their contact list with Facebook.I have long wondered whether they can match these two kinds of shadow profiles together. One profile with personally identifiable information. The other profile with detailed browsing history. That would raise a huge privacy concern especially since these are non-Facebook users and therefore people who have not opted into this at any level."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"A link that is shared on facebook gets an additional fbclid query parameter (interesting that google has it&#39;s equivalent glclid query parameter for links from google adds).I think that it is easy to get rid of this query parameter, when want to use such a link. (just adding, as I don&#39;t see that mentioned in the pdf)I think that the purpose of this query param is to act as a substitute for cross site cookies: when you click on some link then the original url is further transfered as the http referrer header of the http request, if they can get hold of the logs of some affiliated site, then they can possibly track the flow of these fbclid attributes.Interesting to observe, how every tiny detail is getting used for tracking purposes. I guess that browsers won&#39;t get rid of any specific query parameters when the url is passed as the referrer header, as that would be a violation of the protocol. However it may be possible to write a browser plug-in that does so."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I love little compression hacks like the one given in the article.I created a word search game way back in late 1978/early 1979 4KB of RAM. I had about 2KB for storing the word database. And I recall I had about 2,500 words. Which I had to type in by hand.I used the 26 tables of words trick too, to drop the first letter. I also treated each word being made up of 32 symbols. I called them letters, but they didn&#39;t represent individual letters necessarily.Edit 36 minutes after writing my original comment: Having just checked my notes from December 24th 1978, I need to correct myself and say it was 38 symbols. Though I seem to recall I actually got it down to 32 symbols. I need to keep looking through my notes to refresh my brain on the solution.A word might end in &#34;ING&#34; so that was considered a single letter/symbol. Words were between four and seven letters long.Most words took up two bytes, some only took up a single byte, only a few took up three bytes, maybe a few dozen took up four bytes. And I judiciously pruned the database to minimize the words that took up three or four bytes so that I didn&#39;t have too many of them. I also packed the bits, so that there was no gaps between words.And it was all written in 6502 assembly, originally for the CBM PET, and later for the Acorn Atom.I was 11 years old and so proud of myself for such cleverness. I still have my notes and scribblings, including the digitised versions from all those years back.Later, when I wrote a much more complex Bookworm type of game I had to take a word list that was about 8MB long, uncompressed, which would just barely fit on the hard drive, and turned it into a trie, which brought it down to just a few dozen kilobytes, which handily fit on a SS/SD 100KB 5+1/4&#34; floppy."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I got nerd sniped and compressed it to under 28K, which was good enough for the goal of fitting it in a 32K NROM cartridge for the NES. On the NES, you don’t need to do better than that, because you get a separate 8K for graphics, and 4K is plenty of space to fit the code for your Wordle clone.https://www.moria.us/blog/2022/01/dictionary-compressionThe annoying part is that the NES only gives you four background palettes, and you are constrained to use all four of those to color your words."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"And far better than gzip compression. Nice work. My takeaway is that context matters - this is not General Purpose Compression, but compression made specifically for this case. Good Stuff."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Yes, I used to,but No, I fixed it :)Among other things, I am team lead for a private search engine whose partner-accessible API handles roughly 500 mio requests per month.I used to feel powerless and stressed out by the complexity and the scale, because whenever stuff broke (and it always does at this scale), I had to start playing politics, asking for favors, or threatening people on the phone to get it fixed. Higher management would hold me accountable for the downtime even when the whole S3 AZ was offline and there was clearly nothing I could do except for hoping that we&#39;ll somehow reach one of their support engineers.But over time, management&#39;s &#34;stand on the shoulders of giants&#34; brainwashing wore off so that they actually started to read all the &#34;AWS outage XY&#34; information that we forwarded to them. They started to actually believe us when we said &#34;Nothing we can do, call Amazon!&#34;. And then, I found a struggling hosting company with almost compatible tooling and we purchased them. And I moved all of our systems off the public cloud and onto our private cloud hosting service.Nowadays, people still hold me (at least emotionally) accountable for any issue or downtime, but I feel much better about it :) Because now it actually is withing my circle of power. I have root on all relevant servers, so if shit hits the fan, I can fix things or delegate to my team.Your situation sounds like you will constantly take the blame for other people&#39;s fault. I would imagine that to be disheartening and extremely exhausting."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"What do you find exhausting?One anti-pattern I&#39;ve found is that most orgs ask a single team to handle on-call around the clock for their service. This rarely scales well, from a human standpoint. If you&#39;re getting paged at 2:00 in the morning on a regular basis you will start to resent it. There&#39;s not much you can do about that so long as only one team is responsible for uptime 24/7.The solution is to hire operations teams globally, and then setup follow-the-sun operations whereby the people being paged are always naturally awake at that hour, and allows them to work normal eight hour shifts. But this requires companies to, gasp, have specialized developers and specialized operators collaborate before allowing new feature work into production, to ensure that the operations teams understand what the services are supposed to do and keep it all online. It requires (oh, the horror!) actually maintaining production standards, runbooks, and other documentation.So naturally, many orgs would prefer to burn out their engineers instead."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"My experience is that the expectations on what your average engineer should be able to handle has grown enormously during the last 10 years or so.
Working both with large distributed systems and medium size monolithic systems I have seen the expectations become a lot higher in both.When I started my career the engineers at our company were assigned a very specific part of the product that they were experts on. Usually there were 1 or 2 engineers assigned to a specific area and they knew it really well.
Then we went Agile(tm) and the engineers were grouped into 6 to 9 person teams that were assigned features that spanned several areas of the product. The teams also got involved in customer interaction, planning, testing and documentation. The days when you could focus on a single part of the system and become really good at it were gone.Next big change came when the teams moved from being feature teams to devops teams. None of the previous responsibilities were removed but we now became responsible also for setting up and running the (cloud) infrastructure and deploying our own software.In some ways I agree that these changes have empowered us. But it is also, as you say, exhausting. Once I was simply a programmer; now I&#39;m a domain expert, project manager, programmer, tester, technical writer, database admin, operations engineer, and so on."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Mea Culpa I&#39;m in the industry. I knew we should have had backups. She is brilliant but not technical and while the backups would have been expensive and difficult due to size, I should have built multiple NAS and distributed them geographically and used Syncthing to keep them updated.To be clear we were legacy G-suite users and have converted to paying customers, so it was a free service while this happened, and is a paid service (I guess is youtube part of that?) now.I just assumed if there was a problem we could youtube-dl everything, it didn&#39;t occur to me that control of the account would be suspended arbitrarily with no recourse for literally no reason. Despite reading about similar things here for years.I guess I just thought those were lightning strikes, and I was focusing my time outside of work on the new SPA rollout we were working on for the company.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&#34;Open core&#34;, seems to mean the low level libs (useful for sure) are FOSS while the full featured apps are proprietary.  This is kind of unpleasant since it creates a tension between a natural desire to build featureful apps with the low level stuff, and not wanting to &#34;bite the hand&#34; that supplied grist-core.  Similar things happen with other partly-proprietary programs like ansible.Aren&#39;t there already some FOSS alternatives to google sheets?

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"A lot of commentators are missing the point. Caselaw is what lawyers rely on to determine what the law is. For years, there was a monopoly, the privately-held West Corporation in Minnesota. In the 1970s, the field became a duopoly, with the advent of Lexis. West eventually sold out to Thompson, the company is now Thompson-West. Computer-assisted legal research was extremely expensive. The Air Force set up FLITE, but efforts to access their database of cases failed. Manual research is effective, but paper publication meant you ran the risk of not knowing yesterday&#39;s results. In the 90&#39;s with the advent of the Internet, a lot of new players moved into the scene; some more successful than the others.  Public-interest organizations sued for access to the cases, which, after all, were all in the public domain. There was a Washington-based group that called the caselaw the &#34;Crown Jewels&#34; of this effort--though EDGAR filings probably have more significance for the public. Time has provided a solution; access to anything older than the most recent 400 volumes of the Federal Reporter is really not needed, as any Thompson-West salesman will tell you. But these efforts to open caselaw to the public is not scammy and has nothing to do with shaming. In the United States, these cases state the law which governs our lives. I&#39;m glad they&#39;ve succeeded in the effort."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I recently had some criminal charges expunged, and I notice they show up here.  Is there any way to request removal of court records which are no longer publicly available from the originating court?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Neat. I&#39;ll add this to my sources on case law -- another one I&#39;ve come across is https://case.law/Per my close friend, the value of these (or, why people subscribe to LexisNexis) isn&#39;t solely the texts, but the cross referencing. It would be really cool to see that get implemented (and no doubt a non-trivial problem!).How do you source your case inputs, as it is bigger than PACER?"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Wow, this scratches a lot of my itches about Git. I teach a Git course at my alma mater, and the things that confuses people the most (the index, how to undo mistakes etc etc) all seem addressed head-on. At first glance, this seems substantially easier to teach than Git.The Git compat seems like a great idea for this to really take off. My team is totally PR based though so if/when doing (Git compatible) feature branches lands in JJ I&#39;m excited to switch."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Interesting ideas! I especially like the automatic rebasing and associated ideas.It&#39;s a bit strange to see &#34;jj st&#34; will automatically add all files to the &#34;working copy&#34; commit. This means that when I initially create my project, run &#34;npm install&#34; to install 500 MB of dependencies, and then run &#34;jj st&#34; to figure out what to include in my first commit, the command is going to copy all of that into a commit object for no reason. I don&#39;t think I like that behavior, to be honest. Is this a requirement of any of the other unique features? Could this be turned off, or modified to be an explicit operation?[append]To be clear, the fact that it&#39;s `jj st` is actually a big part of the problem for me: this is the command I use to figure out what to put into my `.gitignore` in the first place! I don&#39;t think that any of the &#34;read-only&#34; commands should be making these kind of changes."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&#34; It also means that you can always check out a different commit without first explicitly committing the working copy changes (you can even check out a different commit while resolving merge conflicts).&#34;That&#39;s really interesting. Having to manage stashes is annoying."</p>

Another example is that Windows still needs a local username and password, even if you&#39;ve logged in with a Microsoft account, and this can get out of sync if you change your Microsoft account password online, meaning you now have a different local password to your online account.It&#39;s a frustration that power users don&#39;t need and this is probably going to force me to relegate Windows to a VM."</p>

Yeah they have security issues, but I run them in a virtual machine not connected to the Internet where I need things like iTunes and MS Office. Some games don&#39;t run in a VM very well because of the overhead and abstraction (unless they&#39;re lightweight or not resource intensive). I have a separate Alienware laptop for gaming on Windows however.My hypervisor OS is a Linux Mint install, with Virtualbox. I use Mint as a daily driver. I also use Cloudready[0] for interacting with the Google ecosystem.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Well I, and my family took several tests with this firm - and I am very upset about this.I will be speaking to a barrister today or on Monday to explore what, if any, remedies we can seek over this in court.Please if anyone could recommend a London-based barrister who specialises in this sort of matter by DM or in reply that would be much appreciated."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The problem here is that it sold the DNA to third parties.  The government &#39;data watchdog&#39; appears to be stepping in to stop this overt failure.Of course, all the testing agencies are collecting DNA.  The records will be somewhere.Do we think that government agencies will be able to access these?  Will the NHS?  Will government access even be stated in the agreements that they signed to be &#39;government-approved&#39;?  Will the data be available to other companies down the line for research?  Or when they are bought up by a big corporation?The point is that this is another erosion of privacy, another cat is out of the bag.  It is all very foreseeable.Once we sanction the collection of private information, eg DNA for health! to prevent child abuse! to stop terrorism! the over-reach is never withdrawn.  Government access to your dna, online record, etc, etc - becomes the new normal.  All while the actions of the government are ever more hidden - eg secret courts, collection of data, etcIn every instance of privacy erosion, a plausibly valid excuse is supplied by the government.  But it is a one-way street.  Why we continuously accept government justifications of excessive over-reach amazes me.  But that we do in general (I don&#39;t!) destroys privacy for everyone."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"You can&#39;t ask for (nor give) a consent that broad: &#34;use my dna for whatever research you want by whoever&#34;. Having been involved a bit with asking for informed consent in a hospital, it&#39;s sooo difficult to design a specific- and useful-enough consent form for legitimate not-for-profit medical research. I hope these jokers go to prison for a long time."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This isn&#39;t discussed much, but I think homes would become noticeably more affordable for families just by having the government stop subsidizing the mortgages of investment properties (e.g. only one mortgage subsidy is available for each family). This isn&#39;t even getting into tax write offs which are too complicated for me to understand the consequences of changing.As it stands, mortgage rates being below the rate of inflation make housing a very attractive investment.The sources of mortgage subsidy that I am aware of are secondary market purchases:  * Federal reserve mortgage purchases
  * Fannie Mae/Freddie Mac mortgage purchases

A big portion of quantitative easing by the Federal Reserve is buying billions of mortgages every month. The Fed is trying to start unwinding this now, but they have had trillions of mortgages on their books since the GFC."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Housing will never be relatively cheap until it’s easier to build a house. It will never be easier to build a house until zoning is more lenient.No state is incentivized to make zoning more lenient. Therefore it falls on the federal government, who lack the authority.The only thing they can do is something similar to what they do with the highways and threaten to take away funds unless all plots of land can be zoned for up to 4-family houses (FHA limit).Potentially quadrupling the amount of housing will do it."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"We&#39;re in the housing hunt right now and we&#39;re losing to all-cash offers and ridiculous terms (like months of rent-free to the previous occupany: those sort of terms don&#39;t come from someone looking for a new place to live). We even lost on two offers where we were the high bid. We have pre-approval, solid financing and were willing to even waive the appraisal. It&#39;s not enough."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Hmmm... I&#39;m skeptical.  Not necessarily because I don&#39;t think that pneumonia could be detected by testing VOCs in breath, but because I&#39;m currently working on a project that uses sensors to do breath analysis and my amateur research has informed me that it&#39;s fairly hard to get right (which is why my primary goal is to identify deltas rather than achieve numerical accuracy).For one, VOCs can be present in breath for other reasons besides some sort of infection in the lung, and VOCs are incredibly hard to differentiate with just a sensor.  The fact that they tend to be faint in human breath even at their highest (in contrast to O2 and CO2) doesn&#39;t help.  Even the most expensive PID sensors for VOCs (they get up into the several hundreds a pop) can&#39;t really tell you whether the predominant gas is acetone or alcohol or acetaldehyde or hydrogen sulfide.  So you&#39;ve got to figure out whether the presence of VOCs is truly an anomaly and not just a part of ketosis.  In which case you will also need to measure at least VeO2 to see whether the VOCs correspond with the Respiratory Quotient.The &#34;e-nose&#34; project, as described on the MakeZine article, doesn&#39;t appear to do that.  It does have an alcohol sensor.  But these sensors aren&#39;t particularly sophisticated.  They use semiconductors with heating elements to detect the presence of gases, and there is almost certainly some overlap between the alcohol and VOCs sensors.If VOCs are produced by pneumonia, then yes, it&#39;s conceivable that even just the VOCs sensor alone would detect this.  But can this group of sensors used in the e-nose differentiate pneumonia from catabolism?Maybe? ¯\_(ツ)_/¯After all, this thing uses AI.  And maybe AI can recognize something that a human can&#39;t by simply looking at a line graph.  I dunno...  Such things should be tested against known inputs before being suggested to diagnose anything."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is what happens when you give children the tools to succeed by teaching them math and science in ways that directly relate to their world view. Obviously, this kid is very bright, but giving kids the tools to understand how the ideas they&#39;re learning can be applied in the real world is so satisfying. They aren&#39;t blinded by previous failures, or the current market, or what can and can&#39;t be done."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Does anybody have a link to what the kid actually did?  I skimmed the video, looked at the diagram, read the original MAKE article, and it seems like the kid did a science project and it doesn&#39;t actually diagnose pneumonia.  Am I missing something important?The reason I&#39;m asking is that I see a lot of these (used to judge science fairs, worked with smart undergraduates who build their own equipment) but most of it overstates the technical advances made by the kid."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&gt; “You can’t exercise your way out of obesity,” […] “you can’t outrun a bad diet.”While this article is being a bit dramatic and possibly understating the impact of exercise slightly, I feel a little dumb that I didn’t know this earlier. It took me several decades too long to understand the obvious, that exercise is for building strength, and losing weight happens by eating less. I tried for way too many years to exercise my fat off, and it never really worked because I’d unconsciously eat to compensate. Once I tracked what I ate, exercise actually became more effective.A lot of people know this already, so it’s not busting everyone’s myths, but we also do have a strange narrative surrounding exercise and weight loss that I bought into. It makes me wonder if we’re physiologically wired to be allergic to the idea of less food, from an evolutionary perspective, because being hungry is literally risking death to our alligator brains."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The conclusion is almost certainly wrong:1. From a simple sniff test, if this were true, then athletes wouldn&#39;t need a lot of calories. This obviously isn&#39;t true, eg Phelps eats 8-11K calories a day. I personally eat around 3.5K calories a day. If exercise didn&#39;t impact caloric burn I assure you I&#39;d be a lot fatter...2. The only plausible mechanisms for why exercise wouldn&#39;t result in more overall caloric burn is that less energy is expended in non exercising states, eg the body is trying to conserve energy and either reduces metabolism or reduces fidgeting, walking, etc. This often happens to people trying extreme calorie loss diets.The implication of this is that somehow the sedentary lifestyle of your average couch potato is the &#34;normal&#34; lifestyle for a body, and the lifestyle of a hunter gatherer is &#34;overactive&#34;, and their bodies are chronically tired and trying to reduce their metabolisms. That... seems quite unlikely.3. Finally, this blog post dives into some methodological issues: https://darrendahly.github.io/post/2012-08-31-hunter-gathere...EDIT: Increased metabolism due to muscle mass is not as big an effect as you’d think: https://www.unm.edu/~lkravitz/Article%20folder/metabolismcon..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Irony.A linked article describing a scientist trying to rigorously find out how weight changes and energy expenditure and diet are connected, revealing the little we do know and the vast sea of what we do not know.The discussion here: full of anecdotes and bro science berating one another &#34;that&#39;s not how it works, it works like this&#34;, &#34;I personally do this-and-that&#34;, &#34;you just have to x-y-z, it&#39;s that simple&#34;."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The underlying case looks to be a pretty straight developing country &#34;referral fees&#34; / kickback type case.One issue is how long these cases take to resolve. This was a whistleblower blowing the whistle.Basic deal was Watson (who ran Northstar) a property developer signed a deal to kick back referral fees to an entity that did literally no work (Villanova Trust) created by a brother of the two amazon employees (Nelson and Kirschner) who were the transaction managers for 9 data center lease deals. The kickback deal was signed after these two Amazon employees met with Watson (the Vendor).Amazon then did $400M in deals with Watson, who then kicked back $5M to the trust in &#34;commissions&#34;. Then amazon discovered deleted files indicating the employees were entitled to &#34;shares&#34; in these projects from Watson of something like an additional $16M.Others in the mix at developer also did some kind of land flip thing. One example was property that they bought for $20M, then sold to Amazon for $116M. In one case there was something like a $20M increase in price on property that was sold to Amazon the day that it was bought?! So they were frontrunning things. Watson was pissed, and wanted a cut, so recorded a meeting with the folks doing the flip scam. But that backfired because the folks doing the flip scam knew about the leasing scam and said, hey, if you don&#39;t back off we&#39;ll blow lid on your lease scam - claiming &#34;that&#39;s FBI&#34;. They did end up compromising on kicking back $5M to Watson from the flip scam.Anyways, all allegations, and thousands of pages so I&#39;ve no doubt got some parts wrong, but it makes for interesting reading!My question - it seems to take a long time to get these white color criminal types into jail.In the linked post, there is a lot of complaining that the FBI messed up the guys career, but man, this court case - why would you hire a guy like this into a position of trust?Note these allegations are contested. “My only hope in defending myself against its false allegations is that the process will be fair and impartial.” Mr. Nelson said per a WSJ article."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"What a weird story. I have limited, tangential experience with getting the FBI involved with crimes of an employee. In our case, they were not in a rush to make any moves against the person until they had an airtight case with indisputable evidence. Honestly felt strange given how obvious the crime was during the investigation.Although in this case the seized funds were apparently returned. I have a feeling a lot of crucial details have been left out of this piece (EDIT: See links below to the investigation details. There are multiple parties involved and some of they were keenly aware that they were breaking laws that were &#34;FBI-type stuff&#34;). The devil’s advocate take on this outcome would be that the person cooperated with the FBI to provide evidence and/or testify against bigger fish in the case in exchange for being let off the hook. If this was the case, we’d probably see some headlines about an Amazon-related criminal charges in the coming months or years. Although in our case the released documents were full of “Company 1” and “Individual 2” anonymity, so someone (usually a journalist) would have to figure out the connection.Or maybe this really was some big misunderstanding with disastrous consequences to the family. Impossible to know from an article from this perspective.EDIT: There&#39;s a more in-depth review of the case here: https://www.geekwire.com/2021/former-aws-real-estate-manager...From the summary, it does appear that multiple people are involved in the case and the person in this article (Nelson) doesn&#39;t look like the key player in the alleged frauds, though he would have played a significant role in facilitating the accusations. There&#39;s definitely some shady business going on, but this guy could have been more of a pawn than active player.One of the text messages from transcripts is notable (Note &#34;Nelson&#34; is the accused person in the Medium article):&gt; “Flip me a couple buildings … and let me really line your pockets like we were discussing!  ” Ramstetter wrote in a Dec. 17, 2018 message to Nelson, according to a copy of the exchange Amazon filed with the court.The transcript in that article is also enlightening, because it&#39;s literally a conversation between two of the partners who acknowledge that what they&#39;re doing is &#34;federal, FBI-type stuff&#34; and express concern over it. If you ever get a message like that from someone proposing to &#34;line your pockets&#34; in exchange for facilitating deals with your employer, maybe don&#39;t work with that person any more."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Terrible story. Civil forfeiture seems utterly incompatible with any notion of a just society. It&#39;s like democracy just gave up and regressed to feudalism.Even _if_ the author had turned out to be 100% guilty of whatever Amazon accused them of - this form of civil forfeiture is still punishment without trial and not in line with the sixth amendment.In all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall enjoy the right to a speedy and public trial, by an impartial jury of the state and district wherein the crime shall have been committed, which district shall have been previously ascertained by law, and to be informed of the nature and cause of the accusation; to be confronted with the witnesses against him; to have compulsory process for obtaining witnesses in his favor, and to have the assistance of counsel for his defense."</p>

We used grid computing (before &#34;cloud&#34; was even a thing) to rapidly scale up compute- right after an experiment, you want to recalculate the optimal parameters based on what you just learned from the experiment and then start over as fast as possible.     This was well before anybody could say &#34;reinforcement learning&#34; or &#34;neural network&#34; around physicists without being pilloried.The best part was the name of our collaborator- &#34;General Atomics&#34; https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_AtomicsHere&#39;s a writeup, https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.58..."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"sigh. My team is facing all these issues. Drowning in data. Crazy S3 bill spikes. And not just S3 - Azure, GCP, Alibaba, etc since we are a multi-cloud product.Earlier, we couldn&#39;t even figure out lifecycle policies to expire objects since naturally every PM had a different opinion on the data lifecycle. So it was old-fashioned cleanup jobs that were scheduled and triggered when a byzantine set of conditions were met. Sometimes they were never met - cue bill spike.Thankfully, all the new data privacy &amp; protection regulations are a life-saver. Now, we can blindly delete all associated data when a customer off-boards or trial expires or when data is no longer used for original purpose. Just tell the intransigent PM&#39;s that we are strictly following govt regulations."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I have caused billing spikes like this before those little warnings were invented and it was always a dark day.  They are really a life saver.Lifecycle rules are also welcome.  Writing them yourself was always a pain and tended to be expensive with list operations eating up that api calls bill.----Once I supported an app that dumped small objects into s3 and begged the dev team to store the small objects in oracle as BLOBS to be concatenated into normal-sized s3 bjects after a reasonable timeout where no new small objects would reasonably be created.  They refused (of course) and the bills for managing a bucket with millions and millions of tiny objects were just what you expect.I then went for a compromise solution asking if we could stitch the small objects together after a period of time so they would be eligible for things like infrequent access or glacier but, alas, &#34;dev time is expensive you know&#34; so N figure s3 bills continue as far as I know."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The AWS horror stories never cease to amaze me. It&#39;s like we&#39;re banging our heads against the wall expecting a different outcome each time. What&#39;s more frustrating, the AWS zealots are quite happy to tell you how you&#39;re doing it wrong. It&#39;s the users fault for misusing the service. The reality is, AWS was built for a specific purpose and demographic of user. It&#39;s now complexity and scale makes it unusable for newer devs. I&#39;d argue, we need a completely new experience for the next generation."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"A couple of years ago, I was attacked by a Kiwi bot near a UC campus. This is my story.The bot and I were moving towards each other on a sidewalk, and when I came close it stopped, as they do when sensing an object in front of them. But there was an awkward moment as I tried to go around it and it repeatedly jerked forward an inch as its motor kicked on and off. Maybe I was walking around the very edge of its radius. In any case, my behavior must have triggered some pathfinding bug, because it turned and drove right into my legs, after which it stopped and sat stationary. Luckily they&#39;re small and move slowly so it wasn&#39;t a big deal, but that memory stuck with me. Articles about Tesla pathfinding issues always bring it back to the surface."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"We were walking past one of these robots whose wheel got stuck halfway off the curb, so it was completely stuck. My friend helped it back up, and it had a prerecorded voice say “thank you for helping me!” It was unexpected and delightful to be thanked by a robot, we make sure to help any we see that are in distress, even though we know they’re owned by a private company with profits in mind."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I worked for this specific company, a couple years ago, as a robot handler and operator.In situations like this it is possible for an operator to manually organize the robots.Before I left we were making great strides to allow 1 operator to be able to keep tabs on up to 5 robots at a time in certain neighborhoods.Campuses, which are fully and thoroughly mapped, can probably have 1, maybe 2 operators at a time. Just watching and interjecting when issue arises."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"On the question of &#34;why 12 notes&#34;, I STRONGLY recommend this video by David Bennett:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvmzgVtZtUQThere&#39;s a really important step missing in the article which has been aluded to by a couple of comments already. It&#39;s the step between:   1. a series of notes defined by the harmonic series, that is, exact integer multiples (or ratios, if you prefer) of a base frequency, a physical phenomena found in nature

and   2. the well-tempered scales used by most western music, which adjusts the ratios to allow certain compositional &#34;tricks&#34; to be used without sounding dissonant.

The set of notes defined by (1) are typically referred to as &#34;Just Intonation&#34;, and was the basis for most western music (and some non-western music) until somewhere between about 1400 and 1600 (lots of room for discussion/debate there).The &#34;problem&#34; with just intonation, if indeed it is a problem, is that if you define two series of notes (call them a scale, if you like) using these integer ratios but starting from two different notes, you will trivially find cases where &#34;the next higher E&#34; is a different frequency. So starting from (say) A and moving by integer ratios gets you to a different (say) F than if you start from (say) B.This means that if you are writing in a just intonation scale with (say) A as the root, you have a set of notes that are not actually the same frequencies as if your scale started on (say) B.By itself, this is not a problem at all - there is all kinds of lovely music written through history that works just fine with notes and scales defined this way. You just stay in the same scale throughout, and there are no issues. There are even some scale changes you can make that still work, you just have to know what they are (and they depend on the root note and the set of integer ratios you&#39;re using, so it gets complicated).But ... somewhere in the period mentioned above, a subset of western musical culture started to want to experiment with &#34;modulation&#34; - changing from one scale to another in the midst of piece. On continuous pitch instruments (e.g. violin, voice), this is entirely possible to do, since they can play any frequency in their range at all. However, it does require significant skill on the part of the performer, since the pitch of a (say) &#34;F&#34; will differ depending on the scale currently in use in the piece.The breaking point, such as it was, came with the development of fixed pitch instruments (keyboards). These can only play the notes they are currently tuned to, and so if the (say) F in two scales is a different frequency, you cannot play in both scales without retuning - an obvious impossibility in the middle of a piece.So, &#34;well-tempered&#34; tuning was developed - the ratios described in TFA. These are tweaked by relatively small amounts so that the notes are close to where Just Intonation (integer ratios) would have placed them, but not precisely the same. These small shifts mean that the (say) &#34;F&#34; is the same frequency whether your scale began on (say) A or B. You can now play a fixed-tuning instrument like a harpsichord or a piano, change from one scale to another, and everything remains &#34;in tune&#34;.Of course, to ears used to Just Intonation, &#34;well-tempered&#34; tuning sounds out of tune. But in the west, most people (even within our musical academies) have grown up used to the sound of well-tempered tuning, and it is Just Intonation that sounds &#34;off&#34;."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I really don&#39;t understand all the hate in the comments for this article. This seems like a really fine introduction to a lot of the concepts. I had to scour the web a long time before understanding that the scales were constructed because of the simple/reduced ratio of root note to the others, which is clearly spelled out in this article.Music theory is, in my experience, typically taught as a list of facts to remember. Deriving it from first principles, insofar as it can be, is not common. This article is attempting to start that process.Some commentators are saying that the article doesn&#39;t address why we have 12 notes but I wonder if they even know why (one answer is because it&#39;s a good compromise between number of notes and that have simple/reduce ratios to each other [0]). I&#39;m also skeptical of music theorists that can&#39;t even attempt an answer to basic questions about note length frequency, why some chords are &#34;sad&#34; or &#34;happy&#34; and other basic questions. It&#39;s difficult because music theory is a hodge podge of theory that&#39;s attempting to describe what&#39;s effectively an evolved language (with different music evolution for different regions), but there are some basic tenets that probably apply.I don&#39;t claim to have deep knowledge but there are a few key facts about music and music theory that are really obscure unless you know where to look. Any attempt at coming to music theory from a more rigorous foundation should be encouraged.[0]  &#34;Measures of Consonances in a Goodness-of-fit Model for Equal-tempered Scales&#34; by Aline Honigh (https://github.com/abetusk/papers/blob/release/Music/measure...)EDIT: corrected spelling (thanks for the comments pointing it out)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Music was taught as part of the quadrivium (alongside arithmetic, geometry, and astronomy), so it has a long history of being thought about in mathematical terms. There&#39;s nothing wrong with looking at music that way. What is so interesting about music is its ability to turn mathematical beauty into aesthetic, artistic beauty.Sometimes the math is just there in the background: &#34;This chord progression is based on certain physical facts related to the harmonic series. That makes it sound good, and I like it&#34;. Sometimes it is brought to the forefront: &#34;All of this music appears to be generated from a short pattern of notes which is recognizable even as it is subjected to rotations, elongations, truncations, etc. That is beautiful.&#34;Certain types of music play up the lovely-pattern-ness of music, and some don&#39;t. Neither is better than the other (denigrate the art of Justin Bieber who dare), but you can probably guess which I prefer :)Consciousness, pattern-recognition, spatial rotation of abstract objects, natural mathematical beauty, poetry, drama, acting/performance, nonverbal collaboration, shared rhythm: music is a nexus for all of these things. Music is nothing short of awesome, in the truest sense of that word."</p>

This is unreasonable and a ticketing system like this makes a ton of sense.Police enforcement could probably solve the issue just as effectively.  Cops ignore loud honking and loud cars when its right in front of them.  If they would just stop ignoring such things the frequency would surely go down as well."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Good. I look forward to this enforcement in my city. I currently live against a major road. During the night, the traffic noise isn’t disturbing, except for about one vehicle in a thousand. And that motorcycle wakes me at 3am. For weeks on end. My neighbor’s kid’s motorcycle. On his way to work at 3am, has to gun it when turning out of the neighborhood, waking everyone. These are neighbors who had shot their next door neighbor’s cat, so unlikely to adapt their actions based upon my request. I’d happily pay for this device for my town. And yes, I’ve investigated soundproofing my bedroom. Quote was around $16k. Multiply that by the dozens of neighbors he wakes each night, and he forces everyone else to bare hundreds of thousands of dollars in upgrades so he can make noise at 3am. As much as I don’t want to step on anyone’s “freedoms”, noise sucks."</p>

Not to even mention how particularly awful leaf blowers are for the environment."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"When do you get a yellow square? I couldn&#39;t find this documented anywhere, so I took a look at the code.Here&#39;s what I found: For each guess, Worldle calculates a proximity score from 0 to 100 -- higher is better. Each row is basically a quantized proximity score meter, from 0 to 100 in increments of 20. If you get at least half-way to the next increment of 20 (i.e. to the next green square), you get a yellow square, too.Example: If your proximity score for a guess is 63, you&#39;ll get 3 green squares and two blank (white or black) squares, i.e. GGGBB. If your score is 71, you&#39;ll get three green squares, and since 71 is at least half-way to 80 (i.e. &gt;= 70), you&#39;ll also get a yellow square, so GGGYB.The proximity score is round(100*(MAX_DISTANCE_ON_EARTH - d)/MAX_DISTANCE_ON_EARTH). Though that max distance is defined to be 20,000,000.This is the important part: https://github.com/teuteuf/worldle/blob/67db30bdf79c0965c19a..."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I worked on a tool at Amazon once that incorrectly calculated royalties, not because Amazon was greedily trying to steal from publishers, but just because of general incompetence (or, lack of sufficient competence maybe).Basically, of the people who wrote the tool, tested the tool, and used the tool, none of them knew exactly how royalties should be calculated and none of them could tell whether or not they were being calculated correctly. They weren&#39;t. We eventually figured out something was wrong and went through a very annoying process of learning about royalties and how they interplay with prices, discounts, and other factors and then set things right.Still, if I were paid by Amazon royalties in any capacity I would carefully double check their math and read the fine print.Maybe it&#39;s greed in this case, but in my time at Amazon I saw many teams in &#34;Keep Lights On&#34; mode where one or two people with vague memories of how services are supposed to work try to keep them running. There&#39;s also high turnover, so it&#39;s very easy to be the person on your team with the longest tenure and also be mostly in the dark about how your services should and do work.  As I say, maybe it&#39;s greed, but I would never rule out the people responsible just not understanding (or doing) what they should be doing."</p>

Either the audiobook was priced at an extreme premium, or, it seems, Amazon just isn&#39;t paying the price I would expect.Edit: I found one response from an author that I think makes a simple point, if not perhaps what the thread describes (still can&#39;t tell). It&#39;s impossible for authors to calculate their expected royalties as there are so many varieties of discounts and price points that customers can pay for a single book: https://twitter.com/AdamEcclesBooks/status/14933236569105489...Which makes sense to me, as there&#39;s purchases and credits and various subscription tiers and audible unlimited and these are just the things I can think up off the top of my head. But again, I would buy a small fraction of the audiobooks I have purchased at full price."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"It&#39;s terrible for the narrator too. In many cases the narrator makes a bad decision to record the Audiobook not for a per-finished-hour rate, but as a &#34;Royalty Share&#34; where they only earn on the Royalty -- that&#39;s 20%  (50-50 royalty split with the author) on the audiobook version.In most cases a narrator will never earn even close to minimum wage for the effort to create an audiobook. And it&#39;s more effort than you might guess. A skilled narrator might produce a finished hour of audio in 5 hours, and a less skilled narrator may take 10 to 12 hours to create that same finished hour. So for a 10 hour audiobook a narrator will have between 50 and 100 hours of work, depending on the material and the production skills of the narrator.It can take literally years to earn $500 to $1000 in royalties -- thats $10/hr -- on a book. And most books never sell enough audiobook copies. And that&#39;s why any narrator who understands this should never accept and ACX / Audible exclusive Royalty share audiobook deal.Now with this Audiblegate revelation it&#39;s all to clear that we narrators are destined to never make our money back."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This F_FULLFSYNC behaviour has been like this on OSX for as long as I can remember. It is a hint to ensures that the data in the write buffer has been flushed to stable storage - this is historically a limitation of fsync that is being accounted for - are you 1000% sure it does as you expect on other OSes?POSIX spec says no: https://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/functions/f...Maybe unrealistic expectation for all OSes to behave like linux.Maybe linux fsync is more like F_BARRIERFSYNC than F_FULLFSYNC. You can retry with those for your benchmarks.Also note that 3rd party drives are known to ignore F_FULLFSYNC, which is why there is an approved list of drives for mac pros. This could explain why you are seeing different figures if you are supplying F_FULLFSYNC in your benchmarks using those 3rd party drives."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Fantastic thread.The history is also interesting. It&#39;s not that &#34;macOS cheats&#34;, but that it sincerely inherited the status quo of many years, then tried to go further by adding F_FULLFSYNC. However, Linux since got better, leaving macOS stuck in the past and everybody surprised. It&#39;s a big problem.Here&#39;s Dominic Giampaolo from Apple discussing this back in 2005, before Linux fixed fsync() to flush past the disk cache: https://lists.apple.com/archives/darwin-dev/2005/Feb/msg0008...And here&#39;s TigerBeetle&#39;s Twitter thread with more of the history and how projects like LevelDB, SQLite and various language std libs were also affected: https://twitter.com/TigerBeetleDB/status/1422854779009654785"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I&#39;m a type 1 diabetic, and this was a helpful post at showing non diabetics why it is so. hard. Non diabetics typically think the difficult thing must be the shots and the finger pricks, right?Not really. The majority of diabetics get used to those things quickly (of course there are some  of course that deal with a major major needle phobia that can make it even harder). The hard part is that it never ends. Almost every moment of every day, your brain has a background process running that&#39;s evaluating every decision in context of your diabetes. There are no breaks. Your prefrontal cortex now has to take the place of a previously complex and automatic bodily process. It&#39;s the last thing you think about when you go to bed and it&#39;s the first thing you think about when you wake up. It&#39;s what you think about when you want to go on a walk, are about to enter a meeting, go into an interview, get on a plane, take a shower.It&#39;s usually little things: &#34;okay, where am I at now? which direction is it going? when did I last eat? do I have snacks ready? do I have enough insulin for the day? what if I start to go low during this meeting? should I pop some carbs and run high for this interview, so I don&#39;t risk a hypo partway through? why am I going low right now when I took the same dose I took yesterday for the same meal? why am I now skyrocketing for no discernible reason, I didn&#39;t even eat anything? shoot, I&#39;m starting to hypo out of nowhere in the middle of this great conversation, which I now have to interrupt to eat a snack and recover for 15 minutes. I fell asleep with a perfect BG, but now I&#39;m awake at 2AM half delirious because my BG fell all the way down to 50, and I&#39;m in the kitchen shoving cookies down my throat because hypoglycemia activates a survival instinct to EAT EVERYTHING that&#39;s extremely hard to control, and I know that I&#39;m gonna shoot all the way up to 250 shortly, which I&#39;ll have to treat with insulin, and I&#39;m basically not going to get any sleep tonight&#34;.And then the math often doesn&#39;t make any sense. There are so many factors that effect it. One day the same number of carbs + insulin may make you go high, and the next low, because of other environmental factors. (See the &#34;42 factors that effect blood glucose&#34; chart in the post.) You&#39;re constantly having to adjust.I&#39;m literally crying while writing this post, because it&#39;s so exhausting and it never ends."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;m a type 1 diabetic and data scientist. Estimating the causal effect of a unit of insulin or food on blood sugar is an absolute crap shoot. Consider that there&#39;s a +/-20% margin of error on the reported carbohydrates on nutrition facts. We might consider this irreducible error that just cannot be modelled (Maybe you could get a calorimeter, estimate the distribution of errors, and reduce that error somewhat). Therefore, even if we created a model that explained all explainable variance, we still have a 20% margin of error. If a meal has enough carbohydrates, a 20% overestimate of insulin requirements would lead to an insulin overdose that would kill you if the resulting low blood sugar is not dealt with. In other words, the irreducible variance is so large that a &#34;perfect&#34; model would regularly suggest lethal insulin doses.My &#34;solution&#34; is to eat low-carb/keto as a &#34;variance reduction&#34; strategy. Still, removing carbs also introduces gluconeogenesis (the production of glucose from protein) as a factor to consider. The synthesis of protein to glucose also occurs on a much time different time horizon than the consumption of carbs themselves which has implications for insulin dosing and insulin type.I could go on! But long story short, modelling blood glucose is bloody hard."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Hi, I&#39;m an artificial pancreas developer! Our device has been approved for human trials which we&#39;re going to begin shortly, probably near the end of this quarter.One thing that the article (which is very well researched, by the way, kudos!) does not quite get right is that the insulin sensitivity _changes_ hour to hour, day to day, month to month. It changes nonlinearly with exercise, stress, sleep, diet, and in a million other subtle ways that we&#39;re still trying to characterize. This dynamism is part of what makes management of blood sugar so hard, because the same dose that got you in range a couple days ago now sends you into a hypoglycemic episode, which can be really really dangerous!The good news is that, while cures for diabetes have been Five Years Out (TM) since the 1980s, artificial pancreas technology (like Loop, OpenAPS, and recently approved Omnipof 5) is here _today_ and already giving people a real solution, not to mention peace of mind, but we still have a long way to go! Access issues, trust relating to years of anxiety induced trauma, cost etc are all barriers to making these solutions widely available, but I feel hopeful that in 20 years, a T1D diagnosis will be as manageable as an eczema one.If anyone has any questions about APs, I&#39;d be happy to field them!"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"You&#39;d be surprised at how fast you can create something with an SQL database, a well used backend framework (eg. Rails) and a well used frontend framework.The things big tech companies do are usually to avoid scaling problems. In particular scaling on the engineering side. The above can scale to billions on the user side if needed but 10k engineers constantly updating and messing with a traditional SQL schema doesn&#39;t work.You&#39;d be crazy to try to replicate something like the big tech companies database storage systems when you&#39;re just starting out. You don&#39;t have 10k engineers. You may think &#34;but i want to scale to a billion users&#34;. Well you still don&#39;t have those problems.

								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; Too many people believe that aiming for good software quality means you need to fully adopt that new technology, whether it’s microservices, GraphQL, or distributed tracing. You’re not done until you’ve switched fully over to the ideal technology.This. We are constantly presented with new and shiny things. And then, barely a year later, there is the next ideal technology. And the next, and the next, and the next.We have seen this with everyhing: Languages, coding standards, paradigms, editors, organisational methodology, interview methodology, frameworks, databases, security, design basics,...the list is endless.But here is some truth:C is still written. As is pure JS. Imperative/Prodecural code never went away. Websites on servers we can physically touch are still deployed. People still write working implementations for almost everything under the sun from scratch. Information-Dense, slim, efficient interfaces that get jobs done are still there. As are monolithic architectures. Good &#39;ol RDBMS still work great. bash is still the dominant shell. grep/cut/awk are still great for analysing logs. Water still flows downhill.&#34;new&#34; and &#34;better&#34; are 2 different words, with different meanings. Something that&#39;s new could be better. But he fact that it&#39;s new, in itself, doesn&#39;t automagically make it better. And even if its better in one scenario, its doesn&#39;t have to be better in all scenarios."</p>

MonoLisa advertises that it&#39;s wider than other monospace fonts, and you can really see that in the comparison. One of the things I appreciate about Victor Mono is that it is narrower than many other monospace fonts (while still being very readable), allowing you to fit more code side-by-side."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I am the only one who finds fonts a bit expensive for personal use? It is not a rant, I am not saying it isn&#39;t worth it, that font designers can&#39;t make money, etc... But that puts it on the same level as tools like Sublime Text or Beyond Compare. For me, it is enough of a turn off not to use a commercial font, especially considering that the free offering is quite good.I totally understand the higher price for commercial use, here, it is cheap compared to the costs of hiring a designer, and it may have a real impact on your sales and ultimately earn you money.But why is the price for personal use around $60? Is it some kind of a sweet spot because most people won&#39;t buy fonts anyways, even for $1, but those who do expect to pay that kind of money. Does it account for piracy, which I guess is easy and goes unnoticed if you only use it personally?"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Newegg doesn&#39;t limit their fraud to selling broken open-box items.I personally saw them try to pass off an expensive mouse that was crusty and scratched as &#34;new&#34; (I double checked and it was NOT marked as an &#34;open box&#34; on the product page or order page).Newegg support refused to process the return, so I had to contest it with the credit card company. Pro tip: the CC support rep told me to process it as &#34;product never received.&#34; He said if you pay for a new item and you get a used item, then you never received the item you paid for. Hopefully I never have to use that again, but now I know (and now you do too)."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I have a theory on what happened at NewEgg with this motherboard:1. GN gets motherboard from NewEgg, never opens the shipping box.2. GN sends motherboard back to NewEgg, as allowed by NewEgg’s policy.3. NewEgg decides to decline the RMA just because they can, claiming whatever excuse they are forced to make up when anyone asks.  (NewEgg went back and forth regarding whether it was thermal paste on the motherboard or damaged pins on the CPU socket.)4. GN knows they didn’t damage the motherboard, since they didn’t even open the shipping box, so they relate the story to their surprisingly large audience, and the whole story blows up.5. NewEgg goes “Oops, bad publicity, we’d better refund them.”6. GN wants the motherboard returned, too.7. NewEgg goes “Oh crap.  We said the motherboard was damaged, so if we actually send the real motherboard back, GN will see that it’s fine and know we lied.  But GN said that they never opened the shipping box, so GN has never seen the motherboard.  We can just send back any old motherboard which is actually damaged.  Genius!”, and NewEgg picks a motherboard which is marked as damaged in their inventory system, and ships it to GN.8. GN opens the newly-received motherboard box, and finds it indeed has damaged CPU socket pins, but also finds an RMA sticker from Gigabyte, with an RMA number on it.  GN investigates, and finds out the whole history of that board, painting a very ugly picture of NewEgg if that was the motherboard which they were originally sold.NewEgg is now in a bind.  They can’t admit to lying about blatantly refusing legitimate RMAs, nor can they admit to knowingly shipping back a fake damaged motherboard to GN.  So what they will probably try to claim is that the damaged board was the one sold to GN, but that it was a mistake in inventory management.  However, this story still would not explain why NewEgg’s returns department missed seeing the huge RMA sticker from Gigabyte, and why they sometimes claimed thermal paste on the motherboard, and sometimes damaged CPU socket pins.  Unless, of course, NewEgg lied and shipped a fake damaged motherboard back to GN."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Newegg had a broken motherboard, already tried to RMA it themselves, then (likely accidentally) sold it as open box.I see no big problem with that first part at all. Seems like a honest accident - stuff like that can happen. No big deal, imho.But investigating the returned board - not seeing the RMA sticker on it, mis-classifying the damage, not checking their own records on the board - and claiming it was &#34;customer damage&#34; without any hard evidence... and not ever double-checking anything at all, after the customer repeatedly insisted they didn&#39;t even open the box...That&#39;s the real problem. It&#39;s almost impossibly sloppy to miss all that during any damage investigation, it&#39;s outright offensive to claim &#34;customer damage&#34; without having done any investigation to substantiate that claim, and it&#39;s complete madness, to spend a lot of time insisting on &#34;customer damage&#34; in discussions with the customer, without ever double-checking the board, the damage or the records.That&#39;s the reason why it&#39;s hard to believe this was a honest accident. Because if it was a honest accident... how could they have never noticed their accident, while &#34;investigating&#34; and refusing a refund multiple times over? With an RMA-sticker right on the board, dated to before the date of sale?"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"A huge problematic deficiency of 1Password is that it lacks literal multi-line text field types.The items in its database let you define custom fields for them, but there is no literal multi line text field. There&#39;s a &#34;File&#34; type, but you can&#39;t simply define fields with multi-line text values. However, every item has exactly one built-in &#34;notes&#34; field, but that&#39;s actually styled markdown text. And you only get one. And its name is always &#34;notes&#34;.It would obviously be extremely useful to be able to define an arbitrary number of arbitrarily labeled multi line text fields that are not interpreted as markdown text.It boggles my mind that 1Password doesn&#39;t support this. What were they thinking??? It makes it a real pain in the butt to store ssh keys and certificates and a lot of other types of information in 1Password.A single markdown &#34;notes&#34; field just doesn&#39;t cut it. It&#39;s not as if it&#39;s technically challenging or a security risk. It already has a &#34;notes&#34; field, so just turn off the &#34;rich text&#34; feature and allow me to make my own! I would have thought it was a pretty obvious and often requested feature, but as far as I can tell, it&#39;s impossible!"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Ah neat, the app exposes an ssh agent socket:    export SSH_AUTH_SOCK=~/.1password/agent.sock

So you would essentially replace Keychain, Gnome-keyring, or the vanilla SSH-agent with 1password. Very nice solution."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I think this is a bad idea for users. I don&#39;t think SSH keys are things you should share across machines in a password manager. If you have two devices, then you should have two keys (though this is the subject of some debate; see [0]). Using the 1Password SSH agent encourages people to have &#34;one&#34; SSH key across devices, which means that any leaks will disproportionately impact them.It&#39;s unfortunate, because there is some real innovation around the per-application usage permissions:&gt; 1Password will ask for your consent before an SSH client can use your SSH key. Because of this, there&#39;s no concept of adding or removing keys like with the OpenSSH agent.If an organization wishes to solve the SSH pubkey distribution problem (the main reason one would copy a private key across machines), then they should use SSH certificate authorities like [1]. In fact, I think that would be a far more interesting 1Password product—HashiCorp Vault could use some competition for this kind of use-case.[0]: https://security.stackexchange.com/a/40061[1]: https://www.vaultproject.io/docs/secrets/ssh/signed-ssh-cert..."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&gt; lost access to paid services that I had set up with social loginI signed up to Quora with my Facebook account, back in the day. Deleted Facebook in 2013 and lost access to my Quora account, with no possible way to recover it.I haven&#39;t used a social login since. In my case, it was fairly harmless, but it made me realise how dangerous social login is. Every time there&#39;s a signup, I look for &#34;signup with email&#34;. It&#39;s the safer option. And if you can, use your own domain for email (Google&#39;s paid email offering supports this, as does Fastmail and countless other email providers). That way if your email provider decides to flip you off, you switch DNS records and you&#39;re up and running somewhere else, and everything keeps on running.But: If you don&#39;t have a copy of emails then you lose all saved emails, so make sure you have a backup strategy in place."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Google is simply not a very reliable business partner for tech. I have a decade worth of experience in the Danish public sector, where I’ve had plenty of great experiences with both Amazon and Microsoft. I know that a lot of people would prefer things to be open source, but part of what you pay for in an Enterprise Organisation is availability of support. When AWS first entered the European market, most of what they sold in the support side was rather automated. Which just couldn’t compete with what Microsoft sells, where Seattle will call you with updates every hour on the hour if you’re a big enough customer. This is a big part of why Azure managed to capture the market share it did under the nose of AWS, the other part being that once you buy Office365 well… Anyway, I’ve never seen a huge tech company change their ways as quick as Amazon did, and today they’re actually ahead of Microsoft in terms of compliance with EU legislation and Enterprise support.Google mean while has the same business-to-business support that it does for private customers like the author here. For some services it’s because Google doesn’t care, but they do care about Education and they still can’t figure out how to readjust to be a valuable business partner even when they actually want to sell you something.So my best advice to anyone using Google services would be to find a better vendor as quick as possible. It’s completely ridiculous that you can lose your business account over someone replying to a spam mail.Just imagine if Microsoft kicked the Danish government out of Office365 every time one of our employees did something silly in their emails. I know there is a difference between us as individuals and the Danish governed, but the point in trying to make is that there isn’t, not to Google at least. So maybe they are just a terrible vendor?This is all anecdotal by the way. I haven’t seen anyone complain about getting locked out of their azure essential subscription, so in my eyes that is simply a safer way to pay for g-suite type services than g-suite. That being said, I do personally host my domain and DNS stuff on their own separate accounts at their own separate vendors, both privately and professionally, exactly because you want that stuff to remain unaffected by everything else."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"When you put it this way, it&#39;s really quite remarkable how tenuous our hold is on even paid for digital services.There is really nothing you could do with a car to prompt the car maker to take it from you. And the state will only take it if you break the law in particularly dangerous ways.When it comes to other possessions it&#39;s even harder for anyone to take them away from you. If I take a kitchen knife and stab someone with it I will go to prison for sure, but I don&#39;t think they will take the knife away. They definitely won&#39;t ban me from buying knives.But when it&#39;s a digital service, even something as crucial as a banking service, it&#39;s seen as normal that you can lose them for posting offensive things on twitter. Perhaps it&#39;s because we haven&#39;t had these digital services for long enough to consider them as really belonging to us, so we accept that they can be taken away at the slightest provocation."</p>
