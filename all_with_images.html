								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Lots of articles quote a $XXX billion dollars per day figure, but those numbers are normally for &#34;worth of goods delayed&#34; which, while interesting, doesn&#39;t tell the story to me.Are there any estimates as to the actual cost of this &#34;mishap&#34;, due to e.g. spoilage, financial/contractual repercussions of late deliveries, personnel/fuel costs?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"A great Twitter thread with many articles/resources if you want a critical lens at the global logistics supply chain.https://twitter.com/CharmaineSChua/status/137586855212986368...I found this article on the impact on super-sized ships on logistical infrastructure useful and fascinating. It describes how the creation of ships too big to fit in the Panama canal (post-PANAMAX ships) was received by 1) Panamanians 2) East Coast / Gulf Coast ports 3) West Coast ports. The Panamanians spent billions expanding their channel to bring port fees and promote attendant value-add services. Ports across the East and Gulf coasts overinvested in trying to make their port the preferred one for these new ships. Clearly, not every port can recoup investments in higher cranes and deeper harbors. There was an irrational optimism on the East Coast, as they sought to take business away from West Coast transhippers (dock in Southern California and ship to the east by train.) In response, the West Coast logistics industry sought and received a series of infrastructure improvements to make transshipment from their ports viable. So, just a few shipping companies are able to increase the size of their ships (for economies of scale) and end up having a major impact on billions of investment dollars in more than a dozen cities. Policy makers in the US aren&#39;t able to pick just a few cities to focus investment in. How can you tell a city that they aren&#39;t going to get those jobs? Perhaps the US should set a maximum ship size to prevent this wastage of resources; but one could argue the efficiencies for consumers could be worth it.https://www.ijurr.org/article/fungible-space-competition-and...The size of these ships keeps increasing at an astonishing rate. See the chart in this excellent talk: https://youtu.be/gdkvAXcZD7U?t=892Moreover, the hydrodynamic effects of these large ships in relatively shallow and narrow canals is underappreciated. We&#39;re liable to see more such incidents as ships get bigger and bigger.https://www.ft.com/content/171c92ec-0a44-4dc5-acab-81ee2620d..."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Nice to see! How do they plan to monetize? I either became blind or missed it somehow. The article does say how they DON&#39;T plan on monetize:    &#34;Rest assured that Deno will remain MIT licensed. For Deno to grow and be maximally useful, it must remain permissively free. We don’t believe the “open core” business model is right for a programming platform like Deno.&#34;

There are some hints though:    &#34;If you watch our conference talks, you will find we&#39;ve been hinting at commercial applications of this infrastructure for years. We are bullish about the technology stack we&#39;ve built and intend to pursue those commercial applications ourselves. Our business will build on the open source project, not attempt to monetize it directly.&#34;

Does anyone have some insight into those? I haven&#39;t watch any Deno talk (maybe one actually?) so it feel a bit strange to make people watch technical talks to find hints of the monetization strategy.PS, if I was a rich investor I&#39;d throw money at this project even as a donation, so no complain at all, but I&#39;m very curious on the monetization plan."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Happy to see Deno get some financial backing!I&#39;ve been building my new multiplayer games website [1] with Deno over the last 4 months and apart from some minor growing pains, it&#39;s been a joy to use.The lack of unnecessary package management, and the TypeScript-by-default approach makes Web dev much nicer. We&#39;re also using TypeScript on the client-side, relying on VSCode for error reporting. We use sucrase to strip the types just as we&#39;re serving the script files, so that there is no extra build time, it feels like TypeScript is Web-native and we can share typed code with the server.[1] Not yet launched but we ran a preview past weekend with hundreds of players over WebSockets: https://twitter.com/MasterOfTheGrid/status/13757583007179735... - https://sparks.land"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"What I find most exciting here is:&gt; Our infrastructure makes it possible to... create custom runtimes for different applications [like] Cloudflare Worker-style Serverless FunctionsFascinated to see what happens here. The serverless / edge compute paradigm fits Javascript hand-in-glove philosophically, but until now it&#39;s always felt quite clunky to me. When I&#39;ve tried it out, I&#39;ve always been left thinking &#34;but this would just be so much easier with a server&#34;.Reading this has made it click for me why that is. A new paradigm needs a new set of tools native to that paradigm.The entire server-side JS ecosystem is currently structured around Node, a fundamentally stateful-server paradigm. You can try to abstract over it, but only so far. It&#39;s not the serverless paradigm that&#39;s clunky, per se, it&#39;s that the tools right now were built for another way of doing things.As a concrete example - Deno has an import system based on URLs, rather than on-disk node_modules. I thought that was a cool feature for convenience, less overhead, more open and sharable packages, etc. But now I realise the full intent of it. It&#39;s much more than all that, it&#39;s a fundamental shift in the paradigm: no implied dependency on stateful disk in the runtime itself."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"As a believer and someone who attends church regularly, this is sad but not unexpected. From my own personal experience - if the church cannot answer questions clearly, their members will look for answers somewhere else. A lot of churches unfortunately are so elementary in their teaching or turn to &#34;feel good preaching&#34; (see Elevation Church). The longterm effect is that a person ends up being tired of getting the same &#34;baby food&#34; and they look to other places. The churches where theology is solid (and clear) tend to be stronger in number and in regular attendance."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"“Because here&#39;s something else that&#39;s weird but true: in the day-to day trenches of adult life, there is actually no such thing as atheism. There is no such thing as not worshipping. Everybody worships. The only choice we get is what to worship. And the compelling reason for maybe choosing some sort of god or spiritual-type thing to worship—be it JC or Allah, be it YHWH or the Wiccan Mother Goddess, or the Four Noble Truths, or some inviolable set of ethical principles—is that pretty much anything else you worship will eat you alive. If you worship money and things, if they are where you tap real meaning in life, then you will never have enough, never feel you have enough. It&#39;s the truth. Worship your body and beauty and sexual allure and you will always feel ugly. And when time and age start showing, you will die a million deaths before they finally grieve you. On one level, we all know this stuff already. It&#39;s been codified as myths, proverbs, clichés, epigrams, parables; the skeleton of every great story. The whole trick is keeping the truth up front in daily consciousness.”David Foster Wallace"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"For comparison, UK church membership is &lt;10% and forecast to fall to to 4% by 2025.Numbers for those claiming to be of &#34;No religion&#34; range from from 50 to 60% depending on region. 38% don&#39;t believe in God or any higher spiritual power.The interesting thing is people will identify as Christian on the census while also not claiming to subscribe to any particular  religion in other surveys.2021 census (just completed this month) results will be interestinghttps://faithsurvey.co.uk/uk-christianity.html"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Zerodium[0], the magic string searched for in the fake user agent, is a zero-day acquisition platform, in case anyone else is wondering. The third parameter to `zend_eval_string` in the commit [1] is the &#34;filename&#34; [2] of the executed code, which is probably used for stack traces. Which is quite a strange choice, because seeing that in the logs would probably ring alarm bells immediately. Overall, this commit seems strange in its structure IMO - not in a &#34;good&#34; covert way, but in a &#34;why does it not try to hide better&#34; way.EDIT: According to zerodiums charts, this would have been a payout of up to 250k$. However, I&#39;m not quite sure what the attackers plan on cashing out on that would have been, given that the exploit would have quite obviously referenced zerodium and therefore would make the submitter the primary suspect of being the author. Maybe some APT used this &#34;simple&#34; format to disguise the actual power? But then again, it would be in their interest for the exploit to actually go through.[0] https://www.zerodium.com/[1] https://github.com/php/php-src/commit/c730aa26bd52829a49f2ad...[2] https://bugs.php.net/bug.php?id=78224 (only mention I found with a documented use of the parameter)[3] https://zerodium.com/program.html"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I think it&#39;s a common sentiment here, 
but I&#39;m turning into a more extreme anti-advertising zealot every day.Even the large ad networks show paid content that violates what I would consider widespread ethical norms - presenting everything from hyperbolic claims to straight fraud to people with little repercussion. I&#39;m reminded of a poignant example in television, where episodes of Jeopardy! are intertwined with their shilling quackery like Prevagen to an audience using the fear of aging. Perhaps I&#39;m growing increasingly blind to any positive impacts of the discipline, but ethically I find it hard to separate the fraudsters from the engineers that enable them.I guess advertising is saving me a lot of money in the end by cultivating this hatred, and though I can&#39;t change the world this screed was therapeutic."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"One of the reasons I have used Ubiquiti over the last few years is their product quality over other networking hardware. The inclusion of ads leads me to revisit those assumptions before my next purchase.Ads, even if self-promotion, are a bellwether for a company being desperate or greedy, neither of which bodes well for their long-term product quality, usually because it indicates sales people are making the decisions. They also often lead to a slippery slope of increasing user data collection"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"So, I don&#39;t have time to read the entire paper, but I thought it would be interesting to share my experience from the other side. I lead the engineering for a company that does the &#34;data work&#34;, we gather terabytes of data, mostly photography and lidar, every day.So far it&#39;s been a crappy industry to be in, it seems the only way to make money is to provide the entire value chain, and this is the business model we&#39;re pivoting to.Just a bunch of photography and lidar scans isn&#39;t worth much to anyone, and it&#39;s very costly to establish a quality data stream. We had enormous capex on sensor gear, training personnel, running the operations. All this to save a couple bucks on sending an inspector physically to the site.If you do the entire value chain, you gather the data, you process it into information, and then you turn that information into actionable reports. So that means that besides running our operations, we&#39;re also doing the modeling work, and we&#39;re providing the industry specific expertise for the actual inspection. So our customers pay for knowing what is broken, where it&#39;s broken, and what the impact of that defect is.In the end, I believe we&#39;ll be very successful, but it will be because our investors were willing to take us all the way, where many other companies have simply given up on the concept."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Real story. I worked on nudity detection for mobile realtime video chat app with on-device deep learning model. (It was successful.) Should be easy: label some data, start from a good network pretrained on ImageNet (we used SqueezeNet), fine tune. The problem was that ImageNet is photos, not video frames, and distribution of video frames from mobile video is somewhat different. Incredibly large proportion of frames are either blank (camera is blocked) or ceiling (camera is misdirected). We ended up adding lots of data for blank and ceiling explicitly labeled as blank and ceiling. It became an excellent ceiling detector, detecting ceilings it never have seen before.Is there a mobile video frames dataset for labeling ceilings? Why not? I can&#39;t believe I am the only one who experienced this. Why is not a ceiling dataset worthy of, say, CVPR? It will improve mobile video on-device deep learning more than most of CVPR papers. This is a serious problem.Edit: I understand why niche datasets remain in industry and not academia. Public datasets are better if they are of general interest. But ceiling dataset is of general interest to anyone who wants to process video frames originating from blocked or misdirected camera aka smartphones, and it&#39;s hard to imagine topics of more general interest once you have obvious things like face."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Yes, this is extremely common and extremely frustrating.Companies, governments, individuals come to me all the time asking how to &#34;Do AI&#34; without knowing anything about their product, data provenance, testing plans, state observability etc...Sure, you can do a toy problem with some interesting vision or NLP framework and some off the shelf data that isn&#39;t ready for production or anything serious. Who cares? That doesn&#39;t do anything novel, it doesn&#39;t actually change your product function.Chomsky said the most important thing to do as a young person is to follow the phrase &#34;Know Thyself.&#34;People who want to do AI need to &#34;Know Thy-data and product architecture&#34; first.I did a talk last year on exactly this: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jK-SBu1iiHo"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Female founder friend (non tech space) was in a female focused incubator / competition. She got only one set of somewhat critical feedback - ie, lacks experience in X and Y which are key in product space Z.She posted a comment on her social media focusing on this feedback as &#34;criticism&#34; that came from a sexist guy &#34;of course&#34;. It was pretty easy to draw the line to the three panelists, one of whom was a guy. Ouch.In a previous life, I&#39;d worked in a awesome (female led!) product company. While I had no experience prior to this, I quickly realized that the product itself and its quality etc was almost irrelevant to success, the X and Y mentioned by the male panelist was unfortunately everything, which you&#39;d only know if you were in the space itself. The female led company I worked for was bought out by a (male led) competitor, who then using much strong x and y skills - cleaned up. Company I worked for got basically nothing.Fast forward - my friends business not doing so great, she asks me for feedback. I said nothing other than enthusiasm. Partly because I was really enthusiastic - she&#39;d put her heart into this project. But her comment on social was in my mind - I had no desire to be next sexist guy &#34;shooting down&#34; an ideaShe&#39;s out of the business I think mostly. Anyways, this parallels the take of the article."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I have been a victim of this, and it is still an ongoing matter. If you don&#39;t want to find yourself a victim of these kinds of people, then you better keep these two links as a reference, and always take them to heart:Narcissists Online: http://www.issendai.com/psychology/narcissism/narcissists-on...What to Remember When Dealing with a Narcissist: http://www.issendai.com/psychology/narcissism/narcissists-wh...People who do this sort of stuff have narcissistic traits at minimum, which of course is an armchair diagnosis. But, these people really do not need to meet the criteria for narcissistic personality disorder. All you need to know is that they are people who will harm you in some incredibly hurtful way, because they have contempt for you being yourself.Some of these people have antisocial traits, and are malignant narcissists. Some of them outright have both narcissistic personality disorder and antisocial personality disorder.Regardless, these people tend to masquerade as &#34;entrepreneurs&#34;, &#34;researchers&#34;, &#34;thinkers&#34;, &#34;doers&#34;, or as &#34;authors&#34;, when their entire works are just plagiarized material from others. People make entire livings off of such grifts and it becomes a central identity, if not their only identity. Of course, it is always about getting the next award or accolade, even though it is &#34;empty&#34; to them because they have intrinsically low self-esteem and an unbelievably fragile ego. But, of course they would never want you to know that."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Reminds me of something I experienced on HN and Reddit, though my case was a far less significant level.I posted a comment on HN in response to some article about Emacs.  Later that day I saw someone had copied my comment word for word in reply to the same article on Reddit.I still have no idea why someone would do that.  I thought at first it was some kind of karma farming operation but the post history of the Reddit user didn&#39;t really fit that profile.  Plus,it seems like r/emacs would be a really poor choice for that.I&#39;ve always been curious to know why someone would do something like this.  It&#39;s interesting to read about it happening on a way larger scale."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Suppose one reads a story of filthy atrocities in the paper. Then suppose that
something turns up suggesting that the story might not be quite true, or not quite so
bad as it was made out.Is one&#39;s first feeling, &#39;Thank God, even they aren&#39;t quite so
bad as that,&#39; or is it a feeling of disappointment, and even a determination to cling
to the first story for the sheer pleasure of thinking your enemies are as bad as
possible?If it is the second then it is, I am afraid, the first step in a process
which, if followed to the end, will make us into devils. You see, one is beginning to
wish that black was a little blacker. If we give that wish its head, later on we
shall wish to see grey as black, and then to see white itself as black. Finally we
shall insist on seeing everything -- God and our friends and ourselves included -- as
bad, and not be able to stop doing it: we shall be fixed for ever in a universe of
pure hatred.-- C.S. Lewis"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Doomscrolling caused by &#34;engagement&#34; metrics.When engagement is all that matters, the most engagement comes when people are divisive, mad/angry or even pushed to extremes.When you feel yourself getting bothered, angry and you have to prove someone wrong on the internet, step away. You are taking valuable time from your own projects and quality of life.People can have different opinions and that is ok, your ideas and opinions are what make you, see that as your unique tool to success. On top of that many &#34;organic opinions&#34; are actually astroturfing and PR designed to promote or get you to &#34;engage&#34;."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"100% agree with the premise. Outrage culture is ruining all reasonable discourse in this country (and world), and is now massively fueled by politicians, corporations, media for their own gains.I do not, however, agree with their solution. Turning off the news/Facebook/Twitter and ignoring everything happening around you is not going to make things better.The world has made a lot of progress over the last few centuries (as the article calls out), but all of it has been driven by common people like you and me getting outraged over things that might not directly concern us. Anger is sometimes justified.Instead, when you read something that angers you, take a few minutes and do that extra step of research. Could it be completely fake? Does the headline reflect the contents of the article correctly (it is normally not written by the author)? Is the data researched and sourced? Is what you are reading heavily opinionated? Are you subscribed to a healthy mix of sources?If enough people actually did this (instead of reading the title and going straight to Twitter/Reddit/HN), meaningless outrage will disappear without the trade-off of not being informed about the world. You will organically discover that everything is a lot more reasonable and moderate than people want you to believe. And if something actually isn&#39;t, you will be able to see it."</p>

Too cooperative. Talks too much.  Talks too little. Gets his story perfectly straight. Fucks his story up. Blinks too much, avoids eye contact. Doesn’t blink.

First it isn&#39;t an ideal screen size for a newspaper.  Second they only show a fraction of the articles.  They also keep articles on their scroll for days and days.  I don&#39;t know about you but I don&#39;t chose a digital delivery to get days old stories.I think the industry needs a well funded disruptor.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Because in 2021 developer tools are fundamentally not profitable. Jetbrains is the exception, not the norm. Developer tools are loss leaders for large corporation to acquire developer goodwill and mindshare. Previously we sold developer tools/PaaS. Programmers do not like to pay for their tooling. You have to sell to management, and when your target is management, then the metrics are completely different from what developers want.This is why no-code and low code are so much more successful than developers tooling startups in terms of revenue and profitability. The people using are the same people who are running the business. The value proposition is clear. &#34;Better developer experience&#34; alone is not sufficient for selling to enterprise. And programmer productivity cannot be quantified in lines of code written. This is hard point to explain and get across on HN because this forum is inherently dismissive of the value of RPA and RAD software."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The kinds of tools like those in the article suffer from being outside of the &#34;main loop of coding&#34;.What is the main loop? Well, as it&#39;s defined since the rise of interactive computing, it&#39;s typing in the editor, compiling, then testing and debugging.Thus we optimize for:1. Typing code fast(or typing less code)2. Compiling code fast(by doing less compilation)3. Minimizing testing and debugging time(by narrowing our definitions of testing to that which is easy to automate).The main loop of coding is not software development. It does not study the domain problem, define new benchmarks for success, untangle communication issues, or refine principles of development. It is a path to coder flow state, feature factoryism and shipping the org chart. These things sort of resemble development - a happy coder delivering features within a definite architecture does serve someone at some point - but also manifest dysfunction. Development failing is just shrugged off as bad programming or bad management.Tools like a Whyline or Reflexion models are not in the main loop. They are an invitation to look carefully at whatever horror has been wrought and address it at a deep level. But that really needs a  researching mindset, not a shipping one.In practice, the available tools very slowly move in the direction of the suggestions of research. There are improvements, but they need projects that put together the pieces and make it a goal from the language design(the main interface) upwards."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"As many on this discussion have noted, JetBrains tools not only don&#39;t collect dust, they are widely used, and the company is profitable. The company is privately held. I hear that they are constantly turning down investments. This proves 1) there is money in tools; 2) The VCs who routinely say &#34;there is no money in tools&#34; are insufficiently imaginitive, which is not surprising if you&#39;ve spent any time with VCs.Why is JetBrains so successful where others have failed? A few thoughts:- Intellij was released in 2001. Eclipse was a close competitor for a while, which made no sense to me. Intellij just worked, and it was intuitive. I found Eclipse to be uglier, slower, flakier, crashier, and far less intuitive. Haven&#39;t heard of it in years.- It was always the case that at least some version of Jetbrains tools are zero cost. I got hooked on it early on. I have been using emacs far longer, and yes, while a sufficiently dedicated developer can make emacs behave like an IDE, it really isn&#39;t one. Intellij just worked out of the box. In the preceding two decades, there were high-end development tools available (Lisp machines and their all-encompassing environments, Lucid for C++, Purify for C/C++ memory problems, Atria, Rational. Trivia: Did you know that Purify was founded by Reed Hastings, the guy who went on to found Netflix?)  The tools were expensive, and I don&#39;t think there were free versions. These companies all went out of business, or were acquired.- Jetbrains is incredibly focused. Having been through several VC-funded technology companies, I can easily see how VC brain farts can destroy a company&#39;s focus. (This dynamic isn&#39;t entirely the VCs fault. Founders stretch the truth to get funded, and then VCs insist on the fairy tales they&#39;ve been told.)- Jetbrains has expanded to other languages, and other kinds of tools (besides just refactoring Java code). The number of languages, technologies, and frameworks that they support is just mind-boggling.- Consistent focus on improving developer&#39;s lives, through steady improvements in functionality, performance, and quality, over 20 years at this point. They started far ahead and have widened the gap.OPs tools look useful. I suspect they would attract a much wider audience if made available through Jetbrains products."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This is why I use Framer, they have a built-in export to React function that is really powerful for early startups (as the whole tool is built on React)My team has been using our Framer export (with a few tweaks) as the actual final UI for our early product. Designing is as easy as in Figma, with the advantage that you have actual React components out of the box (working chart libraries, video components... any package you want to use). Whatever you design is responsive, can be connected via API to any database, and all of this is done collaboratively in the same document.It has been a mind-blowing experience in terms of product shipping speed, and as a designer, it really makes you connect in a deeper way with the complexity of the final code."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I can see a bright future for this approach. Figma is very &#34;constructional&#34; design tool, encouraging the use:- variablized colors and fonts, that can become CSS variables and classes- Components and component hierarchies, that can turn into React components- Auto-layout that is based on Flexbox- Component propertes (Variants in Figma, but with enough effort it can turn into attributes for React components).With a bit of annotation inside Figma, I can easily see pretty good results for this conversion."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"If Figma has their eyes open, they&#39;ll run with this idea. Design once in Figma, generate UIs for React, Vue, Jetpack and SwiftUI. Designers become way more productive, doing part of the work of front end devs."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This is a good read. For a long time I explained to people that the value of search advertising was that it matched a buyer who had just asked a buying question with advertisers who wanted to answer that question. This was HUGELY different than previous Internet &#34;banner&#34; advertising. Think of it this way; I put a poster up in the metro that says &#34;Best Deals on Rolex watches&#34; and a million people a day  &#34;see it&#34; but a vanishingly small number want to buy a Rolex. However, if Google gets a query &#34;Where to buy a Rolex&#34; or &#34;best deals on Rolex watches&#34;, well you know that person is perhaps already considering buying a watch, so you want first crack at the deal.The secret sauce was instantly pairing &#34;commercial intent&#34; (or the intention to do some commercial action, buy, sell, hire, Etc.) with vendors and firms who can satisfy that intent or &#34;aspects&#34; of that intent. (You might get an Uber ad on a query for &#34;restaurants near me&#34; for example)Amazon has that in spades. If you are on the Amazon site, that is a huge signal that you are intending to make a commercial transaction. Either with Amazon, or perhaps you are reading reviews of things you can get locally, but the probability that you are about to do something commercial is much much higher. (So does Facebook along a different vector but that is a different post for a different time.)I know from experience at Blekko that one way to piss off Amazon is to out advertise them :-). That just told me that they considered Ads strategic and selling stuff was secondary to that goal[1].[1] I reasoned it this way, if selling stuff was primary then any additional exposure is &#34;good&#34; even if you have to pay affiliate fees for it. If advertising was the money maker, then someone doing it better than you (converting your ad revenue into their affiliate revenue) then you respond harshly to that."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Amazon makes more revenue from ads than Youtube does (and Youtube makes 100x what Reddit does). That&#39;s nuts.Chart of each ad/marketing channel by spend for context:
https://www.rightpercent.com/b2b-guides/which-marketing-chan..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I worked in the ads org at Amazon an year ago and yes I can tell you the revenue generated by ad products across their services is insane. It&#39;s a well executed operation and it is only growing rapidly year over year. From a customer perspective they are also very relevant most of the time.The remaining part is making sure they don&#39;t upset customers way too much since that would conflict with the idea of &#34;customer satisfaction&#34; the company has."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Some articles&#39; job is to spark a great rebuttal. This is a great read, and great debating.  Nerd-bait-ey information density so high.The economic equilibrium of the Bitcoin economic model is as follows: the total cost of all electricity invested into the network over a 10-minute period strives to be equal to the present financial value of 6.25 Bitcoins. If electricity becomes cheaper, then more electricity gets poured into the system, producing the exact same output. That is why Bitcoin is not a battery — Bitcoin is a sink: its economic output is constant, regardless of the amount of resources poured into it.³ When miners pour more electricity into Bitcoin, they don’t get more Bitcoin; instead, the entirety of the Bitcoin network becomes more secure. Security is not a commodity,.... Bitcoin is indeed incentivizing the creation of cheap power sources, but those sources are not going to be used for anything...I learned more about bitcoin in a few minutes than so many hours of people talking while saying so little. Glass of ice water in hell. I can now deduce that the &#34;equilibrium energy cost&#34; of bitcoin is currently $45m per day."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Bitcoin is not a battery for the very simple reason that it does not store energy: you cannot turn a bitcoin directly back into energy.Proof that energy has been expended has no intrinsic value at all. If it did, we would not throw out burnt toast. But it is mere entropy."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Bitcoin is the digital gold for the cryptocurrency universe atm. It&#39;s not really useful anymore for any of its advertised goals - Ethereum is a far better coin for all practical purposes. But since it&#39;s the first and it&#39;s accepted everywhere, it&#39;s going to maintain its dominance. Obv. Bitcoin is also deflationary having a fixed supply.But really it&#39;s really about it being the gateway to the altcoin universe, where actual useful stuff is being built. The Bitcoin Core team has fallen prey to corruption and collusion with miners, unf."</p>

Moved last night to the latter.Github pages is fine, but the extra gh-pages branch is kind of annoying. It&#39;s fairly clear (for obvious reasons) that they mainly think about Jekyll users, though I had a Hugo blog there for a while.Netlify sounds great, but in practice I ran into an annoying issue that I couldn&#39;t resolve where I had to rerun every automatic build.  This probably isn&#39;t really their fault but the forums didn&#39;t work.Cloudflare Pages kind of just worked out of the box, and since I was already using it for my DNS, changing where the domain pointed took a few seconds.I&#39;d suspect, if you corrected for how many issues were particular to me, I&#39;d say Cloudflare Pages ~ Netlify &gt; Github Pages. I&#39;m kind of surprised the latter charges you for custom domains; I do have to say there&#39;s more documentation for Github than any of the others."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Hosting a personal blog on old / cheap hardware at home and accepting some downtime now and then should be a trade-of worth making for most. An interconnected web of documents served from personal computers residing under a desk or in a basement – it is a beautiful thing.We nerds often seem to fall into the trap of over-engineering things, like, spending a lot of time building personal stuff that can scale into the infinity – only to end up never having more than 10 concurrent visitors at any given time.By accepting and embracing the intermittent and slightly unstable nature of serving websites from our homes, we can take back much of the in(ter)dependence and hacky, quirky fun that many of us fondly remember from the 90&#39;s and 2000&#39;s.Setting up a webserver on a Pi and serving it from home can be a fun project, not necessarily trivial for everyone, but definitely within reach for most technically inclined people.Might be among the cheapest, easiest AND fun ways to host a static site :)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"GitHub Pages or Netlify for sure. With either of these options, your static site can be set up to deploy whenever there&#39;s new commits to the specified branch.Me and a friend mentor for Code Louisville, and we&#39;re able to get the beginner frontend students up and running very quickly using these options - they&#39;re free and much easier to use."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"It&#39;s not just Qualcomm it&#39;s closed source driver blobs in general.Even if your CPU might still be supported your other hardware might not. A common offender is camera drivers as far as I know and while you sometimes can still make the camera work it often comes with noticeable decreased quality (as the special patent encumbered closed source image post processing sausage is missing).Besides that potential but as far as I know less likely  offenders include the modem.Ironically both might be integrated into the SoC which then massively increases the chance for problems."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"It&#39;s mind-boggling to me that Qualcomm only guarantees 2-3 years of support for their chipset. Compare that to the PC processor space, how much does AMD/Intel provide? 10 years? More?Somehow people seem to be running on 15 year-old Thinkpads without a problem, yet a $1000 phone apparently can&#39;t scrape by for more than three years due to vendor support?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Congratulations to Fairphone. This sounds like a massive task especially for such a small team. I run a Fairphone 3 and I couldn&#39;t be happier. Sure it was on the pricy side but it&#39;s served me well, takes great photos, has survived numerous drops (the phone protector shipped with it is great), looks cool,strikes up interesting conversations now and then, and will apparently have Android updates well into the future. Fairphone&#39;s a great company shipping a great product. Well worth the investment!"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I don&#39;t think that this is the answer to &#34;only google can crawl the web&#34;. This is a huge archive suitable for making a web search engine maybe.What if you want to make a simple link previewer? An abstract crawler for scientific articles? Most websites are behind cloudflare which will block/captcha you, but happily whitelist only google &amp; major social sites. Tha answer is measures that bring the web back to basics, not this over-SEOed bot infested ecosystem. FANGS succeeded in sucking out all the information of the web, but they suck at creating protocols that are interoperable (even twitter now needs its own tags!).Incidentally, maybe the next search engine should use a push-system , where websites will ping to it whenever they have updates. If the engine has unique features, it might be actually seen as a measure to reduce the loads from bots."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Good resource, admirable intention, great that it simply exists. Good sized index.I see a lot of people subscribe to the idea of this being the feeder to alternative search engines.I&#39;d guess part of the problem with doing things this way is the &#39;crawl priority&#39; of what the search engine thinks are the next best pages to crawl, it&#39;s totally out of their hands or at least, they&#39;d still need to crawl on top of the Common Crawl data.The recent UK CMA report into monopolies in online advertising estimated Google&#39;s index to be around 500-600 billion pages in size and Bing&#39;s to be 100-200 billion pages in size [0]. Of course, what you define as a &#39;page&#39; is subjective given URL canonicals and page similarity.At the very least, the common crawl gets around crawl rate limiting problems by being one massive download.Would be interesting to know if there&#39;s an appreciable % of site owners blocking it, though going on past data (there is some data in the UK CMA about this also), it&#39;s not a huge issue.[0] https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/5efc57ed3a6f4...

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This article seems to be saying that it&#39;s reasonable to expect that google should avoid reporting or fixing security vulnerabilities being actively exploited by the US government, and this isn&#39;t something that should make other counties consider Google to be working as an agent for the US government and therefore deserving of being blocked or sanctioned.By the same token should we we also consider it reasonable for companies Huawei to avoid fixing security vulnerabilities being exploited by governments like China and not consider them to be deserving of having importation of their products blocked on this basis?I don&#39;t think other countries would necessarily want to use google products if they are intentionally leaving security vulnerabilities open, so maybe it is better that all companies fix all security vulnerabilities they find?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is a lot of words to say that Google found and caused the patching of security exploits in consumer devices such as Safari, iPhones and Android phones.And the users of the exploits were a state actor that was friendly to the USA.Which is effectively saying that wanting vulnerable software is a patriotic thing.Especially calling it a &#34;counter terrorism&#34; operation. Where did the author of the article get that information from?It seems like a hit piece."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"To me, this is not a difficult decision or a debate.Allowing vulnerabilities to remain open/undisclosed because your government approves of them... for one thing, they aren&#39;t only useable by your government/allies, you don&#39;t know who else knows about them.Our government&#39;s approach of finding security vulnerabilities and keeping them for their own use (instead of responsibly reporting them to get fixed) puts all our security in danger. There isn&#39;t much we can do about that (except, well, try to use our &#34;democracy&#34; to get the government to behave differently).But in USA at least, private citizens can&#39;t generally be compelled to cooperate.If engineers at a private company find a vulnerability, it should be responsibly dealt with to fix it. No matter who else knows about it or may be taking advantage of it.I think it is unethical for a software engineer to do or go along with anything else."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Last night I was writing a blog post about how to use const generics. I included instructions on installing Rust Beta, and setting your directory to use the Beta compiler instead of Stable. I started to write a disclaimer like &#34;By the way, this will be stabilized in a future version of Rust, probably on...&#34; and realized that const generics were being stabilized in less than 9 hours! So I removed all that stuff.If you&#39;re interested in some concrete examples of using const generics to write faster code, my post on them is here: https://blog.adamchalmers.com/grids-2/"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I think the way that Rust releases keep hitting the front page of HN helps create an illusion that the language is changing faster than it really is. There&#39;s a sense in which a front-page worthy release is expected to be a big one, and if that happens all the time, there must be a lot of big changes, right? That said, I&#39;d have to say it&#39;s worth it in the case of stabilizing const genetics."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The bigger problem, to me, is not around crawling. It&#39;s the asymmetrical power Google has after crawling.Google is obviously on a mission to keep people on Google owned properties. So, they take what they crawl and find a way to present that to the end user without anyone needing to visit the place that data came from.Airlines are a good example.  If you search for flight status for a particular flight, Google presents that flight status in a box.  As an end user, that&#39;s great.  However, that sort of search used to (most times) lead to a visit to the airline web site.The airline web site could then present things Google can&#39;t do.  Like &#34;hey, we see you haven&#39;t checked in yet&#34; or &#34;TSA wait times are longer than usual&#34; or &#34;We have a more-legroom seat upgrade if you want it&#34;.Google took those eyeballs away.  Okay, fine, that&#39;s their choice.  But they don&#39;t give anything back, which removes incentives from the actual source to do things better.You see this recently with Wikipedia.  Google&#39;s widgets have been reducing traffic to Wikipedia pretty dramatically.  Enough so that Wikipedia is now pushing back with a product that the Googles of the world will have to pay for.In short, I don&#39;t think the crawler is the problem. And I don&#39;t think Google will realize what the problem is until they start accidentally killing off large swaths of the actual sources of this content by taking the audience away."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"https://knuckleheads.club/the-googlebot-monopoly/ has actual details.&gt; Let’s take a look at the robots.txt for census.gov from October of 2018 as a specific example to see how robots.txt files typically work. This document is a good example of a common pattern. The first two lines of the file specify that you cannot crawl census.gov unless given explicit permission. The rest of the file specifies that Google, Microsoft, Yahoo and two other non-search engines are not allowed to crawl certain pages on census.gov, but are otherwise allowed to crawl whatever else they can find on the website. This tells us that there are two different classes of crawlers in the eyes of the operators of census.gov: those given wide access, and those that are totally denied.&gt; And, broadly speaking, when we examine the robots.txt files for many websites, we find two classes of crawlers. There is Google, Microsoft, and other major search engine providers who have a good level of access and then there is anyone besides the major crawlers or crawlers that have behaved badly in the past that are given much less access. Among the privileged, Google clearly stands out as the preferred crawler of choice. Google is typically given at least as much access as every other crawler, and sometimes significantly more access than any other crawler."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"On a related note, Cloudflare just introduced &#34;Super Bot Fight Mode&#34; (https://blog.cloudflare.com/super-bot-fight-mode/) which is basically a whitelisting approach that will block any automated website crawling that doesn&#39;t originate from &#34;good bots&#34; (they cite Google &amp; Paypal as examples of such bots). So basically everyone else is out of luck and will be tarpitted (i.e. connections will get slower and slower until pages won&#39;t load at all), presented with CAPTCHAs or outright blocked. In my opinion this will turn the part of the web that Cloudflare controls into a walled garden not unlike Twitter or Facebook: In theory the content is &#34;public&#34;, but if you want to interact with it you have to do it on Cloudflare&#39;s terms. Quite sad really to see this happen to the web."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"It&#39;s always surprised me that we haven&#39;t seem more attempts at co-op like models in spaces like this, and I&#39;m happy to see it.Uber/Lyft strike me as thin businesses in the value that they actually provide both to riders and drivers. Yes, they were responsible for some initial innovation, but now the cat is out of the bag, and the concept could absolutely be applied in a business structure that is more profitable and friendly to the people actually delivering the services.Getting initial traction with riders, and adequately investing in trust &amp; safety strike me as the two hardest parts up front. On the flip-side, they should benefit from less regulatory scrutiny, and less pressure from investors vs. the heavily funded players like Uber &amp; Lyft.I&#39;m rooting for them and hope to see this go somewhere."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is doubly ironic and amusing if you think about how Uber/Lyft were &#34;disrupting&#34; the existing markets. Well, market forces are at work: if Uber/Lyft provide no additional value over drivers&#39; work (and treat drivers as disposable assets), they themselves will get &#34;disrupted&#34; and the drivers will get rid of them :-)Happy to see this happening, and I wonder how this will develop."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I hope this takes off. Ride-hailing apps always seemed like a model that was extremely conducive to a cooperative, worker-owned model. I would gladly (and will try to next time I&#39;m in NYC) use this service over Uber or Lyft. Power to the drivers!"</p>

All of this would&#39;ve been unimaginable a mere 10 years ago, right around the time when Google Chrome was in its infancy (or just out of it, to be precise) and the web browser market was still dominated by Internet Explorer, with Opera, Firefox and Safari (back when there was a Windows version of Safari) taking up small slices of the market share.Another cool site to check out: https://coveryourtracks.eff.org -- a great tool to see how unique your browser&#39;s &#39;fingerprint&#39; is and how well it protects you from trackers and other annoyances online."</p>

It&#39;s always a cat and mouse game with the browser vendors and ad makers.Like web push notifications and popups are two really useful features but the amount of abuse they have had to endure is amazing. Every shitty site from newspapers to reddit to facebook must show a dark screen and ask me to subscribe to web notifications before i can see anything.Then there are hidden APIs for which no permission is needed, like trapping of the back button (where a site gains access to my browser&#39;s back button and won&#39;t let you go back) and page close button (where it shows a popup asking you to confirm you want to leave)."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I think the conclusions miss the mark slightly and focus on a symptom of good bosses: they care about tasks from a state of understanding what is required to do them well, they have empathy for the challenges, and respect for the talent in completing them. Obviously the easiest way to get to this perspective is to experience it first-hand, hence the correlation between those who could do the job and being good managers of the job, but I don&#39;t see this as a requirement, just a common path.I also don&#39;t see this a refutation that we shouldn&#39;t hire good engineers into management, rather we shouldn&#39;t do this blindly and as the single criteria. My best managers were all top quartile engineers but probably not top 5-10%, because they also cared about the non-technical requirements that a good manager needs to cover, and this inevitable consumes focus, effort and time that your best engineers don&#39;t want to allocate.I&#39;m a relatively new engineering manager (~3 years) and wrote about the traits of a good development manager from my perspective here:https://www.codeleadmanage.com/articles/20200204-four_qualit..."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"One of the most fascinating breach analyses I&#39;ve ever read.Reading between the lines, I sense the client didn&#39;t 100% trust Mr. Bogdanov in the beginning, and certainly knew there was exfiltration of some kind.  Perhaps they had done a quick check of the same stats they guided the author toward. &#34;Check for extra bits&#34; seems like a great place to start if you don&#39;t know exactly what you&#39;re looking for.Their front-end architecture seemed quite locked down and security-conscious: just a kernel + Go binary running as init, plain ol&#39; NFS for config files, firewalls everywhere, bastion hosts for internal networks, etc.  So already the client must have suspected the attack was of significant sophistication.  Who was better equipped to do this than their brilliant annual security consultant?Which is completely understandable to me, as this hack is already of such unbelievable sophistication that resembles a Neil Stephenson plot.  Since the author did not actually commit the crime, and in fact is a brilliant security researcher, everything worked out."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Superb work. The &#34;who&#34; of attribution is more likely related to the actual PII they were after than any signature you&#39;ll get in the code. Seems like a lot of effort and risk of their malware being discovered for PII instead of being an injection point into those users machines. I rarely hear security people talk about  why a system was targeted, and once you have that, you can know what to look for, inject canaries to test etc."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I also like that the boat is stuck, but not for the same reasons.A stuck boat in general is not usually a big deal, but this particular stuck boat is giving visibility to how fragile and interconnected everything is. Of course we &#34;know&#34; that, but we often don&#39;t see the extent of it until a disaster happens.A system&#39;s capacity got stretched. For a while this worked fine, but safety margins became smaller. It was just a matter of time before an accident like this would happen. And there is no redundancy (on this part of the canal).So I like this stuck boat because it shows where &#34;the system&#34; has weaknesses. The system extends of course into many areas. Trade, finance, engineering, probably politics, etc.Unfortunately, due to greed (oops, &#34;efficiency&#34;) we will always be running systems at, or slightly beyond capacity so accidents/disasters like this will continue to happen.I also like that the boat is stuck simply because it is an example of how quickly the world can &#34;unite&#34; in peaceful discussions around an absurd situation."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Was this article written with GPT3? It sure reads like it....This is what Shortlyai spat out for me:I like it that the boat in the Suez canal is stuck,
I really do. I can&#39;t help but feel good about this, 
Not for myself or because I know someone aboard, 
But just because it&#39;s so nice to see orders being reversed. 
Such a long process for me to travel back and forth, 
Sometimes with a visa and sometimes not. It would be great if they could shake things up back home.
I like it that the boat is stuck.I like how the people onboard are still sending their messages, 
And I&#39;m sure many of them are thinking that if they wanted to, 
They could get off the boat and walk around in Ismailia or Port Said, looking for a job. It&#39;d be great to be able to find work in Egypt, but not everyone would think it&#39;s worth all that effort. Plus if they did go ashore there might be an investigation so even if they did a little work for someone on board they might still get into trouble. I know that things will eventually calm down back home but first we&#39;ll have a few good years where people can travel freely and without much hassle."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is what I like about engineering... The problem is there, right in front of you. It can be a very difficult problem, but at least it&#39;s right there, you can see it and measure it and talk about it without debating the underlying facts of the problem.Edit: I&#39;ll rephrase... I like that the problem is tangible. It may not always be obvious. :)"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Housing cannot both be a good investment and affordable by definition unless new supply outpaces demand. The problem is that for so many Americans, their house constitutes the majority of their net worth which naturally causes them to advocate for policies that increase their property values which among other things, includes zoning limitations that depress new supply."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The average 30-year mortgage rate in 2000 was 8.05%. Given a $2500/month target payment and 20% down, someone could buy a $423,870 house.The average 30-year mortgage rate in 2020 was 3.11%. The same $2500/month payment with 20% down buys a $730,892 house.Ignoring down payments (which differ greatly between the two examples) and other expenses like property taxes, the 2020 mortgage rate allows someone to buy 172% as much house as they could in 2000. This doesn&#39;t translate perfectly to rental prices, but property affordability via low mortgage rates is heavily correlated with increasing rent prices.Not a perfect comparison, but it shows how much mortgage rates are driving the housing price boom. Scary to think what&#39;s going to happen when (if?) rates start going back up.Source for historic numbers: http://www.freddiemac.com/pmms/pmms30.html"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I wonder how much of this is due to supply/demand and the simple fact that more people want to live in about the same number of dwellings. Even if population growth doesn&#39;t explain it, urban population growth might. e.g. San Francisco has seen huge growth but constructed basically no new units. So it&#39;s not exactly surprising the prices go up.The funny thing is, all the rich people living in these cities would never be able to survive without all the poor people commuting into the city to support them. The more expensive the city gets, the longer those commutes get. It&#39;s a horribly regressive system because now the poor people are spending multiple hours a day commuting, which is a huge opportunity cost of time that they could have spent advancing their social mobility.At some point something has to give. You can&#39;t just keep filling cities with rich people if nobody is there to keep them running."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&gt; One weird inconsistency I’ve noticed is that hair color is done via ZWJ, while skin tone is just modifier emoji with no joiner. Why? Seriously, I am asking you: why? I have no clue.Mainly because skin tone modifiers [1] predate the ZWJ mechanism [2]. For hair colors there were two contending proposals [3] [4], one of which doesn&#39;t use ZWJ, and the ZWJ proposal was accepted because new modifiers (as opposed to ZWJ sequences) needed the architectural change [5].[1] https://www.unicode.org/L2/L2014/14213-skin-tone-mod.pdf[2] https://www.unicode.org/L2/L2015/15029r-zwj-emoji.pdf[3] https://www.unicode.org/L2/L2017/17082-natural-hair-color.pd...[4] https://www.unicode.org/L2/L2017/17193-hair-colour-proposal....[5] https://www.unicode.org/L2/L2017/17283-response-hair.pdf"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Fantastic post that builds up knowledge along the way. A fun case where this type of knowledge was relevant: when creating emoji short links with a couple characters (symbols), I made sure to snag both URLs: one with the emoji (codepoint + `U+FE0F`) and one with just the symbol codepoint.Another thing worth calling out: you can get involved in emoji creation and Unicode in general. You can do this directly, or by working with groups like Emojination [0].[0] http://www.emojination.org/"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The article is great, but there is one slightly misleading bit at the start:&gt; The most popular encoding we use is called Unicode, with the two most popular variations called UTF-8 and UTF-16.Unicode is a list of codepoints - the characters talked about in the rest of the article. These live in a number space that&#39;s very big (~2^23 as discussed).You can talk about these codepoints in the abstract as this article does, but at some point you need to put them in a computer - store them on disk or transmit them over a network connection. To do this you need a way to make a stream of bytes store a series of unicode codepoints. This is an &#39;encoding&#39;, UTF-8 and UTF-16, UTF-32 etc. are different encodings.UTF-32 is the simplest and most &#39;obvious&#39; encoding to use. 32 bits is more than enough to represent every codepoint, so just use a 32-bit value to represent each codepoint, and keep them in a big array. This has a lot of value in simplicity, but it means that text ends up taking up a lot of space. Most western text (e.g. this page) fits in the first 127 bits and so for the majority of values, most of the bits will be 0.UTF-16 is an abomination that is largely Microsoft&#39;s fault and is the default unicode encoding on Windows. It is based on the fact that most text in most language fits in the first 65535 unicode codepoints - referred to as the &#39;Basic Multilingual Plane&#39;. This means that you can use a 16 bit value to represent most codepoints, so unicode is stored as an array of 16-bit values (&#34;wide strings&#34; in MS APIs). Obviously not all Unicode values fit in, so there is the capability to use two UTF-16 values to represent a code-point. There are many problems with UTF-16, but my favourite is that it really helps you to have &#39;unicode surprises&#39; in your code. Something in your stack that assumes single byte characters and barfs on higher unicode values is well known, and you find it in testing fairly often. Because UTF-16 is a single value for the vast majority of normal codepoints, it makes that worse by making it only happen in a very small number of cases that you will inevitably only discover in production.UTF-8 is the generally agreed to be the best encoding (particularly among people who don&#39;t work for Microsoft). It is a full variable length encoding, so a single codepoint can take 1, 2, 3 or 4 bytes. It has lots of nice properties, but one is that codepoints that are &lt;= 127 encode using a single byte. This means that proper ASCII is valid UTF-8."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"We used this a couple times at Sandstorm back in the day. At the end of the interview the candidate would play Factorio cooperatively with the team for a while.I think it is remarkably effective at identifying the kinds of skills and personality traits that a software engineer actually needs to have in day-to-day work. You can find out if someone is self-directed, how fast they work, whether they produce clean designs or spaghetti code, whether they are good at cooperating or tend to go off on their own, etc. Some people will just sit and watch and do nothing unless instructed... that&#39;s bad. Some people will build stuff, but with obvious efficiency flaws and &#34;bugs&#34;... also bad. Some people identify what needs doing and get it done effectively but without trying to be perfect... that&#39;s good. Factorio essentially compresses real-world work patterns into a shorter time period, giving you the chance to see how someone works in the space of a couple hours. I don&#39;t know anything else that does that.But, obviously, it&#39;s problematic. A person who has played the game before will have a big advantage. A person who doesn&#39;t play video games at all will have a big disadvantage. For these reasons, I don&#39;t think I could seriously recommend this approach be adopted more widely.But then, I don&#39;t know of any approach to interviewing that I think is fair. Everything has problems:* Regular interviews bias towards people that are charismatic, not effective.* Coding interviews bias towards people who can code under pressure with someone looking over their shoulder, which is almost nothing like real-world coding.* Puzzle-y algorithms questions identify people good at clever solutions but that&#39;s hardly what most people need to do day-to-day when coding.* Take-home assignments bias towards people who have lots of free time, and still don&#39;t really tell you how that person works with others.* Looking at GitHub history biases against people whose lives are too busy to code in their free time (e.g. maybe they have kids) and who weren&#39;t lucky enough to have a previous job that touched a lot of open source.* Looking at past work experience misses brilliant junior programmers coming out of college.* Don&#39;t even think about using ML for this, that doesn&#39;t solve biases, it just hides them in a black box.It seems like there&#39;s no right answer here."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Please don&#39;t. Better, I&#39;ll remove the please and go JUST DONT FUCKING DO IT.Hiring is broken because most people hiring aren&#39;t good at it and the people working in tech are pretty much idiots (I&#39;m focusing more on SV-startup, 5hour discussion about aeropress, put people down because they chose vim or emacs - people kinds). From &#39;cultural&#39; fit interviews (who the fuck cares if you are a sikh or an atheist, whiskey drinking or think alcohol is evil? You are hired to do a job, not much more). This &#39;i have my social life at work, so I want people I can hang out with&#39; shit has got to end. I work remotely for 10+ years and I can see in interviews/meetings the people that seem to base their identity and life around work, and the ones that actually are well rounded people that don&#39;t care about which coffee grind size you use on your morning crap of joe.I have been a professional boxer and dabbled with MMA/Grappling. I can say most things in the article can apply. So.. at the end of the interview just get them in gloves and duke a few rounds? I would be sued out of existence, but for some reason, between take home assignments, 10h whiteboard drilling and whatever the fuck is hip now (leetcode or what not), interviewing is broken because people are idiots. I have been interviewing people for the last 5 years. If in an one hour talk that is semi technical, you can&#39;t understand if the person knows what the fuck they are doing or not, then the problem is you, not the whiteboard or the take-home or the paid assignment. Just admit most people interviewing others for technical positions have not fucking clue or training, BUT, hey, they are smart people from Standford or MIT, so &#39;how hard can it be&#39; and we get the clusterfuck that it is now"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Good lord, this is an awful idea. I&#39;ve played a ton of Factorio, and I&#39;m a decent engineer, and while the skillsets are similar conceptually, the actual execution and mechanics of them are very very different. Factorio involves a lot of care with spatial layout, tricks to optimize loading the conveyer belts, ensuring that the right ratios of pre-cursors are sent, etc etc.You could get a candidate who perfectly understands design patterns for programming, because they&#39;ve studied programming and know how to program using programming languages and programming tools, but they don&#39;t translate that very well into the spatial environment of Factorio. Debugging and optimizing in Factorio again are conceptually similar to doing so in a programming language, but the actual techniques and patterns available to do so are very very different, and you have to learn them. Most of us do not figure these things out from scratch by ourselves.As others have pointed out, it also is begging for a monoculture. Plenty of people who are good at programming don&#39;t give a shit about video games, and will either do poorly in this interview, or will skip it altogether. The result would be hiring one type of person, and not having any other skillsets on your team. Even as someone who would do well in this interview, I would run screaming, as I do not want to work in a monoculture."</p>

A good ramp-up from basic splitting to ranking.It does need to be said that when Lucene had a set of features this small, it was also pretty tiny.

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I worked previously for a very high traffic ecommerce company (Alexa top 300 site).As part of the search team, I worked on a project where we deliberately rewrote the whole product search engine in Python and Cython, including our own algorithms manipulating documents for deletion, low latency reindexing after edits, and more.We did this because SOLR was too slow and the process of defining custom sort orders (for example, new sort orders defined by machine learning ranking algorithms, and needing to be A/B tested regularly) was awful and performance in SOLR was poor.It was a really fun project. One of the slogans for our group at the time was “rewriting search in Python for speed.”The ultimate system we deployed was insanely fast. I doubt you could have made it faster even writing the entire thing directly in C or C++. It became a reference project in the company to help avoid various flavors of arrogant dismissal of Python as a backend service language for performance critical systems."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"In the mid nineties I worked in a research institute. There was a large shared Novell drive which was always on the verge of full. Almost every day we were asked to clean up our files as much as possible. There were no disc quota for some reason.One day I was working with my colleague and when the fileserver was full he went to a project folder and removed a file called balloon.txt which immediately freed up a few percent of disk space.Turned out that we had a number of people who, as soon as the disk had some free space, created large files in order to reserve that free space for themself.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I don&#39;t think people are giving enough credit to how stuck the ship is.Look at some of the photos of the front of it.  Look at how far out of the water it is sitting.  The ship might look like that if it were totally empty, but not when it is full of containers like this.Some people saying: just drag it off of the sand.  Okay!  And what happens when that causes you to rip a hole into the hull of the ship?  Now it&#39;s really stuck.Some people have suggested unloading the ship.  I don&#39;t think you realize the infrastructure required to unload a ship.  You&#39;re basically asking to build a port in the middle of the egyptian desert.

You can maybe unload a few per hour with helicopters. There doesn&#39;t exist any infrastructure which could get to that location and lift off containers. You could build a custom crane barge but that would take at least a month to fabricate and get to the site. The easiest way to remove containers will be using cutting equipment, winches and possibly explosives. It won&#39;t be easy and will likely take several weeks to unload a significant number of containers, the ship and containers will be damaged in the process.That leaves dredging the sand under the ship. Again the infrastructure to do this rapidly doesn&#39;t exist. You can dig out the sand around the ship but there is a huge amount that the ship is resting on. It will take specialist dredging equipment to start removing this sand."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&gt; There is a popular opinion among developers that SQLite is not suitable for the web, because it doesn’t support concurrent access.No, the issue is it doesn&#39;t have high availability features: failover, snapshots, concurrent backups, etc. (Edit: oops, comment pointed out it does have concurrent backups.)SQLite isn&#39;t a toy DBMS, it&#39;s an extremely capable embedded DBMS. An embedded DBMS is geared towards serving a single purpose-built client, which is great for a desktop application that wants a reliable way to store user data.Once you have multiple clients being developed and running concurrently, and you have production data (customer accounts that are effectively legal documents that must be preserved at all times) you want that DBMS to be an independent component. It&#39;s not principally about the concurrent performance, rather it&#39;s the administrative tasks.That requires a level of configuration and control that is contrary to the mission of SQLite to be embedded. They don&#39;t, and shouldn&#39;t, add that kind of functionality."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;ve built a complex CRM that handles 2.1 million USD in transactions every year. It is running sqlite with a simple in-memory lru cache (just a dict) that gets purged when a mutating query (INSERT, UPDATE or DELETE) is executed. It is very simple and more than fast enough.Friendly reminder that you shouldn&#39;t spend time fine tuning your horizontal autoscaler in k8s before making money."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"With no sense of overstatement here, SQLite is one of my favorite creations in the entire world, so I have a bunch of links some of you might find interesting if you want to dig further:https://github.com/sql-js/sql.js - SQL.js lets you run SQLite within a Web page as it&#39;s just SQLite compiled to JS with Emscripten.https://litestream.io/blog/why-i-built-litestream/ - Litestream is a SQLite-powered streaming replication system.https://sqlite.org/lang_with.html#rcex3 - you can do graph-style queries against SQLite too (briefly mentioned in the article).https://github.com/aergoio/aergolite - AergoLite is replicated SQLite but secured by a blockchain.https://github.com/simonw/datasette - Datasette (mentioned at the very end of the OP article) is a tool for offering up an SQLite database as a Web accessible service - you can do queries, data analysis, etc. on top of it. I believe Simon, the creator, frequents HN too and is a true SQLite power user :-)https://dogsheep.github.io/ - Dogsheep is a whole roster of tools for doing personal analytics (e.g. analyzing your GitHub or Twitter use, say) using SQLite and Datasette."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Whatever was said at the time, I’m convinced Google Reader was collateral damage from the Bay of Pigs Google Plus effort. It had social features (which I honestly never used) and anything social had to be G+.Still, I honestly don’t understand why this is the hill people want to die on, what they feel most betrayed about. Like I haven’t seen some people this upset since Firefly was canceled."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"It was in the summer of 2008, three years after Google launched Reader and had at least 5 million users, when I decided to write my own RSS reader. There were just so many features I wanted that I knew Google would never build and for some strange reason I thought I could make money with my own opinionated take on a news reader.Then at 4pm on March 13th, 2013, I got an email from Nilay at The Verge asking if I&#39;d heard the news. That was a difficult month as I scaled (and wrote about scaling[0]), since by then Google Reader had 10 million active users. After Reader was sunset, about 5 million found their homes on the news readers that remained.It&#39;s strange to think that naively competing with one of the big platforms paid off, but there&#39;s plenty of companies that did well in the wake of a giant choosing to ignore the ecosystem near their feet.[0]: https://blog.newsblur.com/post/45632737156/three-months-to-s..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"All these years later, I still use the Google Reader frontend (with newsblur as the backend).It turns out that Reader&#39;s UI assets were stand alone enough that you could just implement the backend API and it all would work.I saw this originally in a project for viewing your Reader Takeout data[1], and just built on that idea to make my own personal Google Reader experience.[1]:  https://github.com/mihaip/readerisdead"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Probably an unpopular opinion, but I don&#39;t think most people who buy a Linux phone actually want a Linux phone. They want an open-source phone. The Linux philosophy isn&#39;t important to them, they essentially want open-source iOS (with all of the polish and out-of-the-box doodads). They want the ability to make modifications, and they want the freedom and transparency that open-source gives them, but they don&#39;t necessarily want to open a PR against the camera app if they want it to more closely match the polish of iOS."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"OK I&#39;ll bite. I wrote a plugin to get mmsd to function with modem manager and I wrote a reference implimentation to integrate MMS functionality into chatty. I also took the time to make sure my patches were upstreamable, and I have taken and worked on every feedback to ensure my patches are upstream able. I filed the ITP bug to include mmsd into Debian proper.I did all of this back from December to February.I still have no idea when Debian will bother to look at the mmsd packaging to include it into their repository, nor when my changes for chatty will be integrated. The ofono mailing list and IRC channel (i.e. the original authors of mmsd, but i think they abandoned it as they have said it hasn&#39;t been maintained in 8 years) have ignored me, so I doubt my changes will ever go back into upstream mmsd (I just consider what I have a fork now). I&#39;m waiting on the chatty dev to finish off a current project to then get to integrating my MMS patches into chatty.I still really want to help, but there&#39;s not much for me to do except wait for upstream devs to get around to integrating my work.Being frank, I&#39;m frustrated that I spent all of that time to implement a feature I want and I know a lot of other folks want, but now I&#39;m just in a limbo hoping that others will get around to it.So I&#39;ll ask, if you want folks to help on the boring things or missing functionality, how do you prevent that from happening?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Yes I want a Linux phone. But I also want one that has similar app support to Android and iOS.The problem is not with the Linux phones that are out there, it is that no apps are and likely never will be compatible with (non-Android) Linux phones. Until that is solved, most people (like me) could not switch out their phone for a Linux phone as a daily driver, however much they would like.Having Linux as an alternative for Windows is a lot easier than having Linux as an alternative for Android/iOS. A lot of the Windows applications we use can be replaced by opensource applications on Linux. And browser based applications already work on both.However, apps on Android/iOS are mostly tied to cloud services. Unfortunately services that most people need in this age. Messaging systems like WhatsApp and Signal are usually tied to your phone, and going without them would result in social isolation for a lot of people. But also for banking and sometimes government services, you likely need to use their apps. And there will never be opensource alternatives for such apps."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&gt; Cal Newport said it best in his book Deep Work: the ability to perform deep work is becoming increasingly rare at exactly the same time it is becoming increasingly valuable in our economy. As a consequence, the few who cultivate this skill, and then make it the core of their working life, will thrive.The people who cultivate that skill, stay up late at night while everyone is asleep so they don’t get distracted. Then they come in late because they need sleep like every one else. As a consequence, deep thought workers are seen by their immediate and responsive counterparts as obtuse, eccentric, or worse: lazy and unable to manage their time.This really comes down to the workers dilemma. Do you spend your time marketing your self to others and letting people know your accomplishments, or do you spend the time doing work that will benefit others? Deep thought workers will bias heavily towards work that will benefit others. This benefit is often non-obvious deep thought workers will run the risk that their peers, that are more connected and more reachable, will take the credit for the results."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;m constantly amazed at how the mainstream population uses phones.Most people tend to have phone with alarming-notifications, so they get informed that they have a message, or email or whatever. The phone interrupts them and directs their attention. They train themselves to be controlled by their phones.I&#39;d go crazy trying to live like that. I have no audible notifications, and vibration only for actual calls. Everything else: I&#39;ll see it when I see it. I tend to think of it as receiving a letter -- I&#39;ll see it when I check if there&#39;s any post, I don&#39;t need to be interrupted right away. Personal space and all that.It just seems so mentally unhealthy. The same applies to sleeping with your phone in the same room."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I recently ported a reinforcement learning algorithm from PyTorch to Julia. I did my best to keep the implementations the same, with the same hyperparameters, network sizes, etc. I think I did a pretty good job because the performance was similar, solving the CartPole environment in the a similar number of steps, etc.The Julia implementation ended up being about 2 to 3 times faster. I timed the core learning loops, the network evaluations and gradient calculations and applications, and PyTorch and Julia performed similar here. So it wasn&#39;t that Julia was faster at learning. Instead it was all the in-between, all the &#34;book keeping&#34; in Python ended up being much faster in Julia, enough so that overall it was 2 to 3 times faster.(I was training on a CPU though. Things may be different if you&#39;re using a GPU, I don&#39;t know.)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Julia is such a wonderful language. There are many design decisions that I like, but most importantly to me, its ingenious idea of combining multiple dispatch with JIT compilation still leaves me in awe. It is such an elegant solution to achieving efficient multiple dispatch.Thanks to everyone who is working on this language!"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;ve been running the 1.6 release candidates, and the compilation speed improvements have been massive. There have been plenty of instances in the past where I&#39;ve tried to &#39;quickly&#39; show off some Julia code, and I end up waiting ~45 seconds for a plot to show or a minute for a Pluto notebook to run, and that&#39;s not to mention waiting for my imports to finish. It&#39;s still slower than Matlab for the first run, but it&#39;s at least in the same ballpark now."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This is cool! I really enjoyed playing around. Some feedback:1. Do not ask for signup before making a theme. There is so much power in allowing users play around without friction. You will get signups from users that are interested.2. Make the editor preview itself a selection tool for various colors and other items. That would make it a whole lot easier to use3. Allow grouping of colors. Some colors are always set to the same value. Allow setting the colors individually too. But users often want harmony."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Hi HN,I built the VS Code Theme Studio after realizing how hard and annoying it is to create a theme the standard way.
You have to tweak tons of hex color codes in a huge JSON file... yuck.
Most of the time you don&#39;t even know which settings to edit, or how they actually affect the UI.
I wanted to build a much more intuitive and user-friendly way of designing VS Code themes, so that anyone could design a beautiful, polished theme in under an hour (instead of a week).
In a future iteration, I want to make the theme studio even handle the process of publishing your theme to the VS Code marketplace for you.
This way, all you&#39;ll have to do is design the theme, and click a single button... &#34;Publish&#34;.
I had a lot of fun building this and I look forward to seeing the themes you create :)(Built with my favorites: Vue.js + Nuxt.js + Firebase)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This looks really really slick. The signup process only worked for me if I turned off tracking protection in Firefox.One bug, entering hex code aggressively tries to convert 3 digit into 6 digit. So you can&#39;t actually type a 6-digit hex code because as soon as you type the first 3 digits, it expands it into 6, so you have to like backspace and mess around with it to get the color you want.It would also be nice to have more flexibility in syntax highlighting section. Not everyone wants to group things in the same way for setting colors."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"There are ways that people talk about gentrification that always makes me slightly uncomfortable. As a non-white person, something always feels like gentrification is something that “good” white people like to blame “bad” white people for doing, when the real problem tends to be wider and more systemic.In this particular instance I find myself asking why it matters that the Weaver residents were originally not from Austin. If you’re born in Chicago, shouldn’t you still have the same rights as someone who was born in Austin? That includes the right to complain. However it doesn’t mean anyone has to listen to you. As other users have pointed out, it’s not exactly a new situation for people to move to a neighborhood and immediately try and kick their neighbours out. It’s just that most of the time they’re told to kick rocks.It seems to me the real crux of this issue is that rich white people are so much more prioritized by the law that a couple of irate Karens can overrule an entire neighbourhoods opinion. It has nothing to do with where they’re from or gentrification.Not that gentrification doesn’t cause it’s own problems. But the way some people talk about it, as though existing residents are entitled to a higher set of rights, leads down some pretty dark paths, especially when newcomers are of a different nationality, or race than current residents. It reminds me of something that used to be said a lot in jest when I was younger in the 90’s and 00’s and working in fast food. Whenever people gave me extra work to do, they justified it by saying something like, “well, he should just be grateful he isn’t working in a rice paddy” (I’m from Singapore originally, but ok). There seemed to be this view that because my parents chose to move to Canada when I was young, I was somehow entitled to fewer rights, even as a citizen."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I live in this neighborhood, about three blocks north of where the car club meets. I’m white. I’m a homeowner. You get the picture.Honestly, these people complaining in Weaver sound insane. They moved into a community and it’s their job to integrate with the community. We have a Brit who lives on my street that does community organizing and he’s been wonderful about building a sense of community that integrates the old and new residents. They should really be talking to him or Pio, mentioned in the article, instead of calling the police and accusing the car club of dealing drugs. Yeesh.With that said, I think there are legitimate criticisms about the car club. For one, they absolutely trash the place every Sunday. When I walk down to the lake on Monday, there’s just tons of trash on the ground. I don’t know who picks it up but it’s certainly not the car club.Also, doing burnouts and donuts on public streets sounds fun but it leaves the road covered in tire rubber and I imagine it smells awful while they’re doing it.Those are basically the two things I’d like to see change, and in my humble, gentrifier opinion, they seem like reasonable issues to talk about with the community. Instead of having those conversations, we get white people leveraging their white privilege in the worst ways and anarchist groups like “Defend Our Hoodz” intimidating new businesses that open up. Fun times in my little corner of the world."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"To be fair, I&#39;m a middle-aged white engineer raised in San Jose, CA relocated to ATX in Dec 2020.I live at the corner of I-35 east-side frontage and 5th in a mega apartment complex. I&#39;ve tried meeting many of my neighbors and most are asocial/antisocial. There are 2 women roommates and an African-American kid who are legit cool that I&#39;ve met so far. Also, I don&#39;t even know the people across the hall. My conclusion from many interactions is my neighbors are mostly phony, little life experience, selfish, corporate clones who steal shopping carts and leave them blocking the hallways, let their dogs pee everywhere in the hallways and don&#39;t clean it up, throw garbage on the floor, don&#39;t wear masks, don&#39;t talk to one another, sit by the pool on their phones, and act phony cool like they&#39;re still in high-school. Heck, my upstairs neighbor complained about my music on the weekend during the day without introducing themselves and not diplomatically. Point being: gentrifiers tend to be mostly uncool and don&#39;t care about anything other than forcing their own bubbles on everyone else.More power to Austin car clubs. Let the gentrifiers pound salt.Edit: I would like to move somewhere near cooler people, but I&#39;m probably going to have to grow a social circle to find that. Also, I wonder if more upscale or cheaper housing tends to attract or repel cool peeps."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I&#39;d love to use ClearURLs, though last I checked it had a major flaw: it allows arbitrary code execution by the provider of the filter list. Among other things, it can redirect script URLs to arbitrary sources, and the filter list is periodically updated from a GitLab page, which enables the filter list provider to perform a targeted attack by serving a malicious filter list to a specific device.The only filter list provider is the extension maintainer, so this information should be safe to share. I have not had the time to set up a PoC, but I&#39;m confident that the filter rules are way too powerful.At the very minimum, the current filter list should be included in the extension package rather than periodically updated from a remote URL. That way the filter list can be audited and must pass a review, without having a negative impact on the effectiveness of the extension, since the filter list does not appear to frequently change.https://github.com/ClearURLs/Addon/wiki/Ruleshttps://gitlab.com/anti-tracking/ClearURLs/ruleshttps://kevinroebert.gitlab.io/ClearUrls/data/data.minify.js..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"It looks like the developer may be in the EU. If they offer the add-on as a business, it may be worth looking at if any of the internet rights legal groups will help take the case up under the 2019 EU platform rules.https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX:32...These make various requirements around how Google act, and include requirements around removing products from platforms.As an aside, it seems crazy that we allow platforms to take action when in positions of such clear conflict of interest, but that seems to be the way of the tech sector."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This reminded me of a library I released in January 2005.  Part of the embedded docs from the 2011 release:    ;;; The @b{urlskip} Racket library provides a function that translates some of
    ;;; the Web URLs that might be used to track a user across sites, by removing
    ;;; intermediate HTTP redirectors or information that might identify the user.
    ;;; Such a function might be used as part of a privacy-enhancing Web browser,
    ;;; or to canonicalize or un-obfuscate URLs for Web analysis projects.
    ;;;
    ;;; Note that @b{urlskip} is not intended to remove information used by
    ;;; ``affiliate&#39;&#39; referral programs to identify site operators that have sent
    ;;; users to a site.  However, in some cases this affiliate ID information
    ;;; might be lost in the process of removing a intermediary URL that is used by
    ;;; a third party to track and profile users.

It had special-case handlers for various URL server authorities and the paths under them.  So, for    http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/redirect?tag=AAA&amp;creative=111&amp;camp=222\
    &amp;link_code=bn1&amp;path=asin/b333

it was coded to preserve only certain query parameters, like:     http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/redirect?tag=AAA&amp;path=asin/b333

A lot of the cases it handled were redirectors, which usually meant only the target URL, which was usually in a query parameter, but might be in the path, and might or might not be URL-escaped.  So, for example,    http://www.google.com/url?sa=l&amp;q=http://www.shopping.com/xGS-AAA_BBB~NS\
    -1~linkin_id-111&amp;ai=REALLYLONGNONSENSESTRING&amp;num=3

would skip the redirector, to be simply:     http://www.shopping.com/xGS-AAA_BBB~NS-1~linkin_id-111

I was going to link here to the code of `urlskip`, but it&#39;s no longer in the package repository where it used to be.  (I added a lot of libraries to that repository, and don&#39;t recall whether there was some reason to remove this particular library.)  It was a pretty niche library, and in a fringe language, so its impact might&#39;ve only been as an example, pointing out that this could be done, and some rules for it."</p>

Apparently, a basic google search is too difficult for HR.Second, it says this:
&#34;On March 9th, we added extra protections for this employee, including actioning content that mentioned the employee’s name or shared personal information on third-party sites, which we reserve for serious cases of harassment and doxxing.&#34;OK, and they _still_ didn&#39;t check why people were opposed to this person? Still no Internet search or, oh, reading the comments people were posting?Notice that this &#34;protection&#34; was two weeks ago, not recently."</p>

Nobody knew whether another in the group is an agent provocateur or a genuine radical. Nobody knew who were throwing the molotovs. Nobody even thought that the protest was likely achieve any its goals. The only thing that could not be faked is the sheer volume of people showing up; nobody could pay that many people to show up at a protest.Therefore the only thing they could do is to keep showing up in support of the demands for as long as they could personally afford to do so, and try not to pay attention to the methods of others when they already knew that all methods were probably going to fail."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This is a great solution to a problem that seems to becoming more prevalent. Reminder to devs that bolted on third party scripts should not be in the critical path. Meaning, if you are doing something like capturing a click event in a Google analytics handler and blocking the redirect until you’ve tracked the click - you’re going to have a bad time. Many tracking scripts are designed for this and will gracefully/silently fail via something like an array push mechanism but I’ve encountered the opposite as well.Being an indie dev with a pihole setup has been tough - I’ve gotta turn it off a lot for various client projects - but it’s also helped me build more resilient applications that work just as well for people who don’t have trackers enabled."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; The SmartBlock stand-ins are bundled with Firefox: no actual third-party content from the trackers are loaded at all, so there is no chance for them to track you this way.Those third party scripts may not be able to track, but I wonder if the act of loading the stand-in scripts quickly (?) from within Firefox would lead to other issues.&gt; We also want to acknowledge the NoScript and uBlock Origin teams for helping to pioneer this approach.Not to belittle the effort by others and other projects, but these two extensions, along with some others (like Privacy Badger), have helped users immensely in protecting themselves."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Next step (please): block all 1x1 sized images.The transparent pixel tracking trick is common enough now that it should be blocked by default in all &#39;Private&#39; modes."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"AMP exists not because it&#39;s impossible to build fast web sites without it, but because it&#39;s possible to build slow web sites without it. Which means most big sites not using AMP are slow because most places don&#39;t have direct incentives for keeping their stuff fast. Against all odds, AMP convinced these sites to build an alternative experience that&#39;s reasonably fast. It&#39;s good that AMP is no longer required to get good rankings for fast pages. That was always a silly requirement. But from a user&#39;s point of view, I&#39;m grateful for AMP, despite that being an unpopular opinion around here."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Usually the answer is &#34;no&#34; to any question in a headline. My answer is &#34;I sure hope so&#34;.AMP launched in 2015. At that time, Larry Page was CEO, Eric Schmidt was Chairman and David Drummond was the Chief Legal Officer. I don&#39;t know how any of them signed off on AMP.Giving advantageous ranking (including, but not limited to, showing AMP content in Top Stories) is the very definition of using your market power in one area (search) to force publishers to adopt something else you created.For a company that is (or should be) very careful about attracting antitrust attention from the US/EU, this seems completely reckless.And what is the upside for Google here? Fast pages? That seems like one hell of a gamble.And on the user side? I, as a user, absolutely hate AMP and wish I could opt out.I have poor vision so use larger fonts on iOS. AMP pages routinely render with the edge of pages cropped off and you can&#39;t scroll so here so this happens to me way too often:1. Click on a link2. Get an AMP page3. Can&#39;t read the page, click back4. Force touch the link to bring up the preview of the page, which is the non-AMP version5. Click on that preview to get the non-AMP page.Why is this still an issue? Why can&#39;t I just get this version of the page always? It&#39;s ludicrous.But I honestly don&#39;t know why Google pushed so hard on AMP."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I sure hope it is the end of AMP (even though it was launched by a close friend of mine at Google).Quite honestly, the concept never really made any sense to me, and often the load speeds were just as poor as the original website itself.One thing that really bugged me was how disorientating it was for the user; on some AMP pages, you literally could not tell if you were on a legitimate website or some spoofed version. The AMP bar at the top was about as trashy a UI design as I&#39;ve seen since 1997. And, God help you if you wanted to share the link - it was hard to know if the AMP link would be &#34;persistent&#34; or &#34;sticky&#34; enough to share, or whether you should go to the actual underlying web page (which the AMP bar did a great job of hiding) and share that.But what is most annoying of all is that smart people at Google were kidding themselves that their botched up implementation of AMP was a great thing to have launched upon the world. It really was not. I bet it didn&#39;t really do much for their bottom line either."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"These secret scanning integrations have been very helpful. We had a client ask to take a project open source recently that had started a few years ago as closed source. We of course checked over the current version of the code and have had linters in place to look for secrets for a while but not in the very early days of the project. In that one codebase we had:- AWS IAM token for S3 upload access to a throwaway dev bucket. The bucket had already been deleted but still... Got an email about it informing me the IAM token had been revoked by AWS within 5 minutes- A Slack webhook notification URL/secret. Committed as a example on a working branch and then git rm&#39;ed but still active. Got an email about it and token revoked by Slack automatically within 5 minutes.- A Mapbox API token. This one was funny. The token was indeed in there and functional but was in the docs/sample code for a dependency. Still, we got an email within the hour about it and were able to investigate.Edit: In this case we intentionally kept the commit history. A safer alternative (and one we normally practice) is to start a fresh repo for the open source variant."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"FYI pypi tokens look like pypi-9NX39cdNn0AH1cCl1bMT48eKzf4Rhvw1mipk1FZTPrpR9The integration means that GitHub knows to recognize this format, and calls some API of pypi.org when it finds one so PyPI can revoke it.As always, please allow me to lament that we don&#39;t have a standard for this, such as secret-token:pypi.org/9NX39cdNn0AH1cCl1bMT48eKzf4Rhvw1mipk1FZTPrpR9, which would let any system know that this string is a secret and that pypi.org should be notified (for example via POST pypi.org/.well-know/compromised-secret).

I can&#39;t wait to upgrade to Fedora 34 to use it.I use Mac OS daily on my work computer and Gnome daily on my personal computer. Yes, I know there are a lot of Linux open source applications that are not very polished, but the quality in Gnome and its core applications is extremely high. There are even some things that Gnome does better than  Mac OS.Now, you might not like Gnome and that&#39;s perfectly fine. Fortunately, Linux is the land of choice and there is an alternative for every person. It baffles me to come here and read so much negativity! Come on! this is a big milestone for a community that has been working a lot to bring you something of quality for free! They have been doing this for decades already and they have put a lot of effort and love into this. How many open source projects fail to abandonment after just a few months?Why is it that so many people in internet communities such as HN can&#39;t take a minute to appreciate the effort and instead the only thing that they are motivated to do is to nit-pick something and trash. Criticism is always welcome, there are even some appropriate channels to do it, but seriously why is this the only thing that you are able to say about a community driven product? Why is there only space for negativity? Why not a small &#34;thanks&#34; or &#34;I liked that feature&#34; before your criticism? They are bringing this thing for you for free, why can&#39;t you at least say something nice?"</p>

I would pay up to $200 USD for such a product. Why not an intel NUC? Because I want to leave this on 24/7 and run various cron jobs etc, so I want the low-power ARM chip.Yes I can build it myself, but shopping for, gathering all the parts etc is time consuming and I&#39;d rather be writing my apps etc to run on the device instead...EDIT: formatting"</p>

Every time my Pi based systems have gone down, it&#39;s due to a faulty microSD.  I was using well rated microSD cards and they still died relatively quickly(months, not years).I suspect they&#39;d be fine if I was running a read-only rootfs, but with a lot of the applications I run(i.e. HomeAssistant) you need R/W capability."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"A lot of people miss the fact that Plan 9 was a real distributed operating system. It&#39;s not just UNIX with a couple features (&#34;ooh everything is a file&#34; &#34;ooh UTF8&#34;). You can effortlessly execute any program across multiple hosts on a network. You can use any resource of any host on the network, including files, processes, graphics, networks, disks. It all just works like magic, using a single message-oriented protocol.If Linux worked like this today, you would not need Kubernetes. You could run systemd on a single host and it would just schedule services across all the hosts on the network. Namespaces would already be independent and distributed, so containers would only be used for their esoteric features (network address translation, chroot environment, image layers). Configurations, files, secrets, etc would just be regular files that any process in any container on any host could access using regular permissions models. About 50 layers of abstraction BS would disappear.I think because nobody&#39;s actually seen how it can work, they can&#39;t imagine it being this simple."</p>

Either this is because HN users are flagging it, or because something else is going on. As Reddit is a YC company it&#39;d be really nice to hear an explanation.This exact same thing happened with the previous threadshttps://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=26554697andhttps://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=26556187There are some awful transphobic comments in those threads, but they appeared _after_ the threads had been penalised."</p>

But I thought the point of professionalism was refraining from this kind of behavior and applying rules consistently even when there is a personal connection. This kind of special-case behavior in favor of people with ties to the site is likely counter productive."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I wish there was a solution for those of us who develop web interfaces for embedded products designed to live on LAN, often without any internet access and no well defined domain name.I&#39;m all for HTTPS everywhere but right now for my products it&#39;s either: https with self-signed certificate, which basically makes any modern browser tell its user that they&#39;re in a very imminent danger of violent death should they decide to proceed, or just go with good old HTTP but then you hit all sorts of limitations, and obviously zero security.I wish there was a way to opt into a &#34;TOFU&#34; https mode for these use cases (which is how browser dealt with invalid HTTPS certificates for a long time), although I realize that doing that without compromising the security of the internet at large might be tricky.If somebody has a solution, I&#39;m all ears. As far as I can tell the &#34;solution&#34; employed by many IoT vendors is simply to mandate an internet connection and have you access your own LAN devices through the cloud, which is obviously a privacy nightmare. But it&#39;s HTTPS so your browser will display a very reassuring padlock telling you all is fine!"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"That makes a lot of sense. HTTPS adoption is now very high[1], and this might push it a little bit further for sites that don&#39;t redirect to HTTPS automatically. I&#39;ve been using Firefox in the experimental HTTPS-only mode, and the web is quite usable without cleartext HTTP.[1] https://transparencyreport.google.com/https/overviewIt&#39;s not a big change from security perspective though. HTTP requests shouldn&#39;t be getting cookies any more, and the redirect isn&#39;t revealing anything new (not until we get DoH + ESNI). You still need HSTS preload to defend against active downgrade attacks.An interesting side effect of the change is that sites won&#39;t have have a working HTTP redirect any more. Inevitably, there will be sites that let their HTTP versions rot and break, which will eventually force all other web clients to default to HTTPS for web-compatibility."</p>

Then we&#39;ll be at just:examplewhich is just one step from the final solution which is that no URLs will be needed because the browser will just open up to Amazon who after final approval of their purchase of Google will at that point own not just the internet but the entire world."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This is an example of a common antipattern in software: some piece of software fails to correctly implement something (here, modern HTML autocomplete=&#34;cc-exp-year&#34;), and another piece of software goes through all kinds of contortions to work with incorrect or incomplete implementations with the result that it now behaves undesirably with a third piece of software. Specifically, 1Password has to do complicated guesses of what to fill where because many sites don&#39;t set autocomplete properly, so inevitably it will guess wrongly sometimes.Other examples are problems with lock files and file versioning (because programs tried to roll their own when the operating system didn&#39;t provide them), and the complexity of parsing &#34;HTML soup&#34; and emails with all kinds of bizarre invalid syntaxes.I can&#39;t offer a general solution, but if password managers simply refused to autofill to any field other than the one with the matching standard autocomplete attribute, web developers might start doing the right thing. (Do Safari, Chrome and Edge already do this? Only they have the clout to make it happen.) The user could still fill out a text box lacking the standard autocomplete attribute by right-clicking and manually selecting the correct field. Password managers should also get cheaper because their vendors would not need armies of developers adding workarounds for popular sites.Somehow this kind of nonsense has become culturally acceptable in the software industry. If the car industry worked this way you&#39;d have to take your car back to the dealer once a month to be patched to take account of constantly changing fuel formulations. Standards exist for a reason."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I had a similar 1Password moment. I was buying airline tickets; entered my name, my wife’s name, address, declined insurance, declined hotel offer, scroll scroll scroll... Then I let 1Password fill in my payment details, which it did perfectly fine. But... what it ALSO did, on a field now well off the top of the screen, was change my wife’s first name to my full name.I caught this when I got the confirmation email. I called the travel website, and they said since it was within 24 hours I could just cancel the tickets for free, or if I liked I could pay an outrageous fee to the airline to change the name on the ticket.  Unsurprisingly I chose the former.So, nor harm done, but if we’d gotten to the airport and my wife couldn’t come on holiday because I didn’t have a ticket for her... could have gone badly. :P"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;ve put &#34;temporarily&#34; in the title because the post now says the money has been refunded. The article is worth leaving up because, unlike the typical riler-upper, it touches on a phenomenon which is interesting in its own right. But I don&#39;t think it&#39;s fair to leave up a title that implies that there&#39;s an uncorrected injustice to get angry about. If anyone has a better solution, we can do that instead."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"What&#39;s interesting about acquisitions like this is that the actual value that is being transacted is the userbase and their data, along with the inability for either of those to easily move elsewhere.No one wants to buy the actual chat application itself, because they could build equivalent technology on their own. But users are locked into platforms so heavily and for such long time periods that they themselves give the platform almost the entirety of its value (not to single out Discord, since we all know this is how a lot of acquisitions work in practice). [As an additional caveat, I will add that Discord has definitely built something that its users love, and I don&#39;t want to undermine the absurd amount of UI, feature refinement, and scaling work they&#39;ve done successfully. It isn&#39;t negligible, but it is also not &gt;$10B of software engineering.]I&#39;ve read many discussions where someone says something of the form &#34;I wish I didn&#39;t have to use X, but my friends and family all use it, so I&#39;m forced to&#34;, and I think upon consideration of this statement that there is something deeply wrong with the way network effects and protocols function on our Internet such that this can even be a common scenario. We really do have quite a crisis of non-interoperability that generalizes towards a complete lack of user control, be it software, hardware, data, or anything in between.With that said, if Microsoft does purchase Discord, it might not be as bad as some foretell. While we can point to something like Skype as a failure, we can also point to something like Github, which has been doing very well post-acquisition, and in my opinion hasn&#39;t gotten worse at all. It&#39;s quite possible they wouldn&#39;t want to profit off of Discord individually, but rather use it as another tool to expand their general ecosystem horizontally. On the other hand, they could also do the exact opposite and start harvesting data and maximizing advertisements en masse, lest my post become too optimistic in tone, since this is still HN. Lastly, remember that this is still just a rumor that various news outlets have picked up on and is nowhere near guaranteed.For those looking for alternatives due to this, or just because they&#39;d like to own their own data for once, I think Matrix is likely to be the best general solution in this product space, both with respect to similar app functionality as well as quality constraints (real encryption, decentralization, FOSS, etc)."</p>

No downloads required.Would you like to try Discord in the new Microsoft Edge, &#34;the browser recommended by Microsoft&#34;?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Discord would be crazy to not take this deal. They could go public, but they have no clear monetization path to ever reach that valuation.For Microsoft, however, it holds incredible strategic importance to their Xbox division. If suddenly the #1 gaming voice and text chat on PC is fully cross-compatible with Xbox and Xbox services it puts Sony at a huge ecosystem disadvantage. When added to the context of Microsoft&#39;s acquisition of Bethesda and their shift in strategy to Xbox as a service it makes perfect sense."</p>

I&#39;ve really missed traveling and watching video walks while exercising has been a great way to satisfy that travel craving a bit and also trick my brain into experiencing some semblance of normalcy (not sure I could remember what a crowded street feels like otherwise haha).I&#39;m partial to Japan so my favorite channel has been Rambalac [1], and I recently also started watching another channel with the very creative name JAPAN 4K [2]. There are tons of other channels and places too, for example I recently watched a few in Lisbon [3] and Seoul [4] and Copenhagen [5]. They&#39;re very relaxing and fun to watch and going from place to place with no cuts captures the usual tourist experience quite well. If you like traveling you can probably find some that are interesting to you![1] https://www.youtube.com/c/Rambalac/videos[2] https://www.youtube.com/user/keikaikeikaikeikai/videos[3] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MXlFDpaQ1ec[4] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqj7l0Xk0Ho[5] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nl69sN5PtgM"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Working from home. I realised being in an office - especially an open-plan office - was setting off my social anxiety all the time. Working in a place where I could choose to engage with people instead of having it forced upon me made it so much easier to work. I became a lot more productive and started enjoying what I did, even picking up more side projects and learning actively. It&#39;s a shame it&#39;s coming to an end, and I can&#39;t seem to find many places that are going to remain remote."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Transitioning my gender. Living my truth. Coming out to everyone in my life and being forced to confront the shame that held me back for decades.It took a lot of reflection and was cause for a lot of growth. But now I&#39;m not only mentally happier, I&#39;m taking better care of my body because it finally feels like it&#39;s my own."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&#34;One day the magic was finally gone. There was no more wonder. What before would make you question what sit beyond the veil, and its impossibility in a linear universe, no longer did. Everything was catalogued, every inch of soil, wrinkles around the corners of your mouth, the reflection on your iris when you were happy, or sad, circumstances you found yourself in. All of that had a rational thread that could be followed back to the big silent eye, data point by data point. There was nothing else to question, no possibility of impossibles, of something unseen. Just this never ending stream of letters that told you that&#39;s all there is, all that you are&#34;"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is fundamentally wrong. I doubt the NGA is actually lying to these writers and more likely just not saying anything and leaving people to guess, but we have long had the ability to see the entire earth and commercial imagery is still a tiny, insignificant part of the national geointelligence enterprise with capabilities dwarfed by the state-sponsored tech this writer doesn&#39;t know about. Private companies gaining the ability to track vessels that turned off their transponders is cute and all, but this is not a new capability by any stretch."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Lots of little cameras up there.  Ok.  They can see ships.  That is a far cry from total surveillance.  There are countless physical limitations that prevent the concept of total space surveillance, from lens diameter to the atmosphere&#39;s absorption of certain frequencies.  I remain far more concerned by the cameras in my apartment building, or taps on my internet/cell connections, than I am about space cameras.Be more worried about your local police operating airborne camera systems.  Drones hovering over cities are far far cheaper than any space-based surveillance scheme."</p>

The lack of support for TLS 1.3 made it impossible to download much of anything.  It was basically impossible to update or upgrade.  Most of the web (and HTTPS APIs) was inaccessible via curl.  I imagine similar issues plague retrocomputing with other OSes.Are there any resources for retrocomputing in the TLS 1.2+ era?  Maybe something like an HTTPS downgrade proxy that requires manual installation of a new cert and is targeted at retro OS isolation?"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This is a great article explaining why a lab leak should always be a suspect. The alternative theory is that a virus traveled on its own (via bats or other animals) from bat caves 900km away to Wuhan where there are 2 labs researching bats. One of the labs is lesser known but is right next to the seafood market and the hospital where the outbreak was first known. [1]This article points out that a lab outbreak could have happened in the United States and many places in the world. We need to avoid demonizing China over this if we want to ever find out the truth and learn how to prevent another pandemic outbreak.[1] https://web.archive.org/web/20200214144447/https://www.resea..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"My understanding of the author&#39;s central thesis is this: the US, despite its world-class virology and disease study labs, regularly has lapses in procedure that regularly lead to situations in which the public might be exposed. Given that this is happening in our own backyard, we might reasonably expect countries of similar status (like China) to experience similar lapses.That reads as reasonable to me, but raises a subsequent question: if these lapses are so common and so many countries possess the capacity for serious mistakes, why don&#39;t we see more regular outbreaks (if not full-blown pandemics) caused by labs? In other words, what makes COVID special? I didn&#39;t find a satisfactory answer to the latter question in the article.It&#39;s my (uninformed, uneducated) opinion that the severity of the author&#39;s claims don&#39;t correspond to the reality of the last few national and international disease crises (AIDS, Ebola, Zika, COVID). Which isn&#39;t to say that we should absolutely dismiss the possibility that COVID originated in a lab, only that claims that it did amount to currently unsubstantiated claims about COVID&#39;s special status among other recent pandemics."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Peter Daszak, member of the WHO Covid origins team, was also the project lead for the US funded gain of function research of novel coronaviruses that was going on at the Wuhan BSL4 lab.There is historical precedent of authorities blaming local meat markets to cover up a lab leak.https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sverdlovsk_anthrax_leak"</p>

But at the same time RMS has been attacked for some statements very probably stemming from his autism that, while they may seem a bit shocking and at odds with the mainstream, were not illegal or intentionally offensive."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"For those who do not know RMS personally: &#34;I worked for RMS longer than any other programmer. ... This was an own-goal for RMS. He has had plenty of opportunities to learn how to stfu when that’s necessary. ... I can confirm the unfortunate reality that RMS’s behavior was a concern [in the 1990s], and that [Marvin Minsky&#39;s] protection was itself part of the problem. He was never held to account; he was himself coddled in his own lower-grade misbehavior and mistreatment of women. He made the place uncomfortable for a lot of people, and especially women. ...  RMS’s mere presence on the scene in this way has served to make it harder to deal with other cases of bad leaders’ bad behavior. It is time for the free software community to leave adolescence and move to adulthood, and this requires leaving childish tantrums, abusive language, and toxic environments behind.&#34; — Thomas Bushnell https://medium.com/@thomas.bushnell/a-reflection-on-the-depa..."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"This reminds me of the trip I took to Iceland in 2010. Just on the day we were about to fly back home we were instructed to turn on the Hotel TV, which was showing very eerie video footage of Eyjafjallajökull erupting. The stark emergency chyron combined with the vague video footage gave us a very unsettled feeling.Then we walked into the lobby where some 80s pop was playing, the staff was cheery and asked what we&#39;d like to have for breakfast because we&#39;d probably fly home a few hours delayed. I guess you become unflappable when you literally live on top of volcanoes :)On the Iceland Air flight home we watched a very interesting documentary about the Eldfell eruptions in 1973.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I actually don&#39;t see any issue that isn&#39;t simply a matter of money.Everything they list that&#39;s an issue seems to revolve around the fact that the employees with domain knowledge for the system have left the company.Reach out to them and hire them on as contractors.  If they left under bad terms because the business was a bunch of dicks, expect to pay 10x market rate.  If this is truly &#34;fix this or the business is out of business&#34; - then it shouldn&#39;t be a tough decision to make."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"How people handle this level of disaster is always very revealing. In every case I&#39;ve ever experienced someone kept their head and a solution was found. Usually there was reputational damage but surprisingly most times the actual business bounced back. But it was always the actions of someone in particular in those first hours that made the difference.Thinking you&#39;re fucked is unhelpful, because you start talking about resumes and expecting some deus ex machina to appear and resolve the situation (for good or ill)."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This reminds me of when the Danish mega-corp Maersk was attacked by ransomware and had all of their computers locked and decrypted with no access.All computers except one, which due to a power failure had been offline the whole time.This computer had the critical DNS information needed to restore the network.Only problem: it was in Africa, in a country that required Visa which would take weeks to apply for and receive. So someone from the African office had to bring the hard drive to an airport that someone from the London office could travel to and pick up the critical hard drive, then bring it on a plane back to London.A sweaty and nervous trip, I can imagine.Whole story here:

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Many of these WiFi-LED lamps contain esp8266 devices, which have a lot of open source alternative firmware available, like esphome[0] or tasmota[1]. You can reflash them by opening them &amp; connecting a cheap (1$) usb-to-tty adapter.If that isn&#39;t an option (for reasons like not wanting to permanently damage them or being afraid of electrical shocks) a lot of them come with tuya firmware, which you can (still) often exploit and convert with TUYA-CONVERT [2].I found the Tasmota Device Templates Repository[3] to be a really valuable resource, although I&#39;ve been using zigbee devices for lightbulbs.[0]https://esphome.io/[1]https://github.com/arendst/Tasmota[2]https://github.com/ct-Open-Source/tuya-convert[3]https://templates.blakadder.com/index.html"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I think I&#39;m missing a few major points. I wonder if someone here might be able to clarify.1. The real meat of this &#34;pwning&#34; was (it seems) a google search to identify the WEB API endpoint. Then it turns out that sending POST requests to this endpoint can turn the light on/off, change its temperature, and change its brightness.2. In order to turn a light on/off using the &#34;found&#34; api, it is first necessary to connect to the lamp&#39;s network. So if I were doing this on my own linux machine, which cannot as far as I can tell connect to multiple wireless networks at the same time, my script to change the settings on the light would include disconnecting from my true wifi network, connecting to the lamp&#39;s network, sending the signal to the lamp, disconnecting from the lamp, and then reconnecting to my own network. Is that right? Is this what the bash scripts and apps mentioned in the post are doing?3. If I lived in the apartment above the OP&#39;s (say), and I were malicious, I could even now also access the lamps&#39; networks and, say, set their values to be whatever I wanted.  And there is simply no way of stopping this (S in IoT, after all)."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"One thing I haven&#39;t seen mention much with these &#34;smart&#34; devices is how inconvenient lack of physical buttons is. Instead of just reaching over and adjust the volume/brightness whatever, I now have to unlock the phone, find the app and do some gestures to achieve same results, all of which now requires some mental bandwidth for these banal tasks."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I had to quit reading any FIRE (financial independence, early retirement) blogs because they were full of people headed down this same path: Extreme frugality, bare minimum savings, assuming their lifestyle would never change and nothing would ever go wrong.Retiring at 30 sounds great, but no one&#39;s life goes exactly to plan for next the 30-40 years until traditional retirement age. People change, expectations evolve, possessions wear out and need to be replaced. Living frugally may be fun when you&#39;re in your 20s, but it&#39;s not so fun when as you get older and your friends want to do things that require money (vacations, hobbies, dining out). Even worse when your romantic partner has different goals in life, as happened here.Many of the leanFIRE stories have their roots in people who hate their jobs so much that the only thing that motivates them is early retirement. They grind through the job the hate, counting days on their leanFIRE countdown until they can quit working and never look back.Most of these people would be much happier if they simply invested time and energy into finding a job they enjoy, or at least one that doesn&#39;t make them miserable. Even if it requires a pay cut and a later retirement date, it&#39;s much better to spend your time doing something you don&#39;t hate than it is to grind out a bad job in misery just to reach dreams of early retirement sooner."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"In my early twenties, I had a business mostly on autopilot that let me work maybe an hour a day. I mostly spent my time writing poetry, hiking, making friends, etc. It was great. It was not sustainable, but it was perfect for a twenty something exploring the joys and freedoms of youth.Now, I work much harder, have kids, and responsibilities. That being said, I know the work I do is meaningful, and serves many people. We have significant savings. Though living in a big city means we can&#39;t retire early. That&#39;s beside the point though: I motivate myself to work because it is meaningful. The same with kids: I don&#39;t do things because I enjoy them, I do them in the service of my kids and my family.  Reading the story in the OP, I get the sense that the OP hasn&#39;t made that transition to thinking about work in terms of serving others. A happy life is not a life of retirement, its a life of meaning. What was meaningful once (aiming for retirement), loses its meaning once it has been attained. You have to keep moving forward. This is not about &#34;Keeping Up,&#34; but about stepping outside of oneself, and learning to put others ahead, even if it requires personal suffering. (Something parents of young children know very well.)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This was a really refreshing and honest take on early retirement, especially among the FI blogosphere.&gt; I looked at other FI bloggers who quit work and retired.  They all appeared to be blissful. Stoic.  Confident and without reservations.  Since I ran into problems myself, I started to feel like I was defective.  Like something was wrong with me and that’s why it didn’t work so well.  Maybe it has to do with my personality (a nerdy introvert).  Or it could be because I’m not trying to sell product and make money off of my choices, like almost everyone else who blogs about FI seems to.There always seemed like a potentially strange conflict of interest with many of the FI bloggers who are ostensibly &#34;retired early&#34;, but still earn a significant amount of money from their FI blogs. Which isn&#39;t to say they shouldn&#39;t be earning that money, but it does bring up questions about some of the conclusions that they make. (There&#39;s also a bit of a groupthink or even cult-like mentality among some of them, particularly in the MMM sphere.)"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"A different take: Microsoft, Oracle, et. al. waged a war against OSS in the 90s. They went as far as using mental illness as a weapon against the community (equating participation in the commons as an equivalent to mental illness).It’s not a coincidence the class of human that weathered the storm looks like Stallman, Linus, ESR, et. al. That’s what it took. The toxicity in these communities is a result of what was leftover. These humans grew up amongst OSS activists that also weathered the storm.They carried the flag when no one else would. Vilifying them now, at a time where Microsoft just purchased the two largest infrastructure/tooling providers for the commons (npm, GitHub) is concerning to me. Without them, the commons wouldn’t be what it is today."</p>

The crimes included: “being super involved with Wikipedia,” retweeting a “hideous” New York Times editorial, and being friendly with famed democracy activist and law professor Lawrence Lessig. Publicly calling out each board member in turn with a clear implication: associate with a thought criminal and you too could be in jeopardy.Did she really do that? wow"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; Luckily, another co-author on the book has spent a lot of time pondering inclusion, women’s rights, children’s rights, and free speech. Her name is Nadine Strossen and her credentials run deep. She served as the first female President of the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), America’s largest and oldest civil liberties nonprofit, from 1991 to 2008. When she stepped down as President, three Supreme Court Justices participated in her farewell luncheon (Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Antonin Scalia, and David Souter). Strossen is a Professor Emeritus at New York Law School and currently an advisor to the EPIC (Electronic Privacy Information Center), FIRE (Foundation for Individual Rights in Education), the ACLU, and Heterodox Academy. She is the author of the widely acclaimed books HATE: Why we should fight it with speech not censorship (2018) and Defending Pornography: Free Speech, Sex, and the Fight for Women’s Rights (1995). She has far too many awards, publications, and prominent appearances to name.A credential sheet of PC accolades long enough to whip a horse shouldn&#39;t be required to publicly disagree with the ideology of Google and ACLU without being fired."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Google results have gotten dramatically worse over this last decade. Google now seems to fixate on the most common terms in my query and returns the most generic results for my geographic area. And, it seems like quotes and the old google-fu techniques are just ignored or are no longer functional.There are a whole host of factors behind this, but I&#39;m certain that the switch to Natural Language Processing / Semantic Search drove this decline."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Many moons ago, I put a ton of work into a (now defunct) content site that provided specific information in a small vertical. Each post took hours, but I enjoyed writing the articles, and the revenue from the ads was enough to enjoy a little extra cash every month (we&#39;re talking just about enough to cover a car payment, for context).Google decided they liked a lot of the content and started providing it in their knowledge graph. It was initially great to be validated and the link to my content at the top of the search result was pretty cool to see. But it did tank traffic, as Google scraping my content and giving it away at the top of their search result page meant people didn&#39;t need to navigate to my site.Felt pretty terrible, if I&#39;m being honest, but I also have always subscribed to understanding the risks for relying on other networks for my own benefit.BUT!!!As a regular user of search engines, I love getting the answer super fast without necessarily having to guess what sort of ad-trap I&#39;ll have to navigate to get the answer I&#39;m looking for on some random content site.As a user, when I&#39;m asking some non-critical question, it&#39;s nice to just get a snappy answer. I appreciate it.The problem of course arises when content creators stop making the content for Google to scrape and index, what then?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"If Google ever started including copy-pasteable code from Stack Overflow, I might never follow a link from Google again.Which I think says a lot about how Google is used now. I don&#39;t use Google to find web pages, I use it to find an answer to a pressing question. When I&#39;m looking for something to read, I go to a content aggregator like HN or Reddit.Of course this isn&#39;t sustainable. If Google is just presenting other sites&#39; data &#34;for&#34; them, and thus depriving them of traffic and revenue, eventually there won&#39;t be any incentive to create the content Google is scraping. Long term, this seems self-defeating for Google, just as its ruinous to the sites they scrape."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&#34;Don&#39;t try to make a career out of optimizing the SQL queries to display a preference page on a line of business app at a company that no one has ever heard of. That is not the straightforward path to having other people learn you are capable of doing meaningful work.&#34;This is so sad. Optimizing that SQL might require being really clever and can bring enormous value for the company that maybe nobody heard about but might be providing some not so sexy but useful service for half of the country.I&#39;ve never heard about company that is building software that runs nearby power plant, but certainly this company is much more useful and have more positive feedback for the society than something &#34;sexy&#34; like Facebook."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I like this framing.In graduate school, I worked for 2+ years before my first paper was published. In that time, I passed my PhD qualifying exam, took classes, wrote code, read papers, learned math, and so forth. Yet when I applied for internships, I received no interest from employers. I suspect this was because I had no concrete signal that I knew anything in my field.While working on my second paper, I started blogging. In the language of this article, I started generating public intellectual capital for myself. I have definitely experienced the effects of this capital on subsequent job hunts. Now I can point people to my blog to demonstrate knowledge, technical skills, and communication skills beyond the scope of my peer-reviewed work. Furthermore, there is no question about who contributed to my blog, and when I learn something new, I can externalize that quickly."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I mean, what the hell is with all this 60-90 hours per week stuff going on? Am I an incredibly defective human being or something - I cannot even fathom working anything even CLOSE to that (in software/tech, maybe if you&#39;re in med school or work an an ER I can see it). There is no way in hell I could ever even be close to productive for that period of time for more than, say, one week a year or something (and even then I&#39;d need weeks to recover).  I&#39;d guess I&#39;d ask everyone, &#34;Really?&#34;. When you work those kind of hours, are you _actually_ doing value-adding or value-optimizing things, or just engaging in work theater?I&#39;ve found the most incredible thing is just to say &#34;no&#34; to things. Not doing things has this fantastic side effect of not causing more work. When you don&#39;t do more things, you don&#39;t cause more problems, which doesn&#39;t need more work, which doesn&#39;t need more staff, which doesn&#39;t require more money, which gives you less stress, and gives you happier staff, happier customers, and a happier self.I wonder if I&#39;ve totally lost my marbles if this kind of thing only makes sense to myself..."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Nyxt seems amazing, but it&#39;s hard for me to imagine using a browser without Ublock Origin. I understand that it doesn&#39;t really make sense for everyone to support webextensions, and it&#39;s a huge amount of extra work, but it&#39;s just a huge barrier to adoption.It&#39;s hard to trust the smaller browsers to keep me private online if there isn&#39;t something that gives me that same level of control over blocking. And there&#39;s a huge adblocking community built around this software that maintains lists, fixes websites, and it&#39;s just a bunch of privacy-focused community effort that is hard for any small team to replicate.But aside from webextension support, Nyxt looks really exciting, and I&#39;m glad that people are building browsers that are actually innovating in this space."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Oh this is very exciting!Not exactly Nyxt (which looks amazing), but that people are  are starting to &#34;emacs&#34; the web. There&#39;s a social process whenever humans make a thing where we rumble around a lot and try different things and eventually we settle on a kinda-ok-for-now-if-I-can-make-some-adjusments thing (like how I just used written english).I&#39;m a little skeptical (for me) that we&#39;ve arrived at a &#39;durable state&#39; for the web. I think it may change a little too quickly for it to make sense (for me) to invest time into learning this particular browser but I am very excited about the trend.Edit: I wrote this comment without even seeing that they support list but of course they do."</p>

They are pointless. But then so is most of the art world - and going a step forward - so is much of what we value.As several people have pointed out they are no less arbitrary than a limited edition print vs a commodity print. The value of fine wines escalates exponentially whilst the extra utility you get from any quality improvements trends towards nothing.Much of what we value is pointless and bordering on delusional.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"It’s bad that Backblaze did not do their due diligence while integrating with Facebook pixel, but the bigger problem is the tendency of third party integrations having default settings that are overly aggressive when it comes to access of user/site data.This should be a warning to every developer, when you integrate with any third party - don’t just copy the default snippet of code they recommend, read the docs thoroughly and then test/monitor what is being sent back to the third party.  And if you are writing a third party widget, be considerate and make the defaults the least aggressive possible when it comes to accessing user/site/server data."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"PSA for any devs out there implementing FB Pixels:– Facebook&#39;s pixel will, by default, attach click listeners to the page and send back associated metadata. This simplifies implementation needs, but can create unintentional information leaks in privileged contexts. To disable this behavior, there&#39;s a flag[1] you can use. After which, you can manually trigger FB Pixel hits and control both when they&#39;re fired and what information is included in them.– There&#39;s a feature for the FB Pixel called Advanced Matching[2] that allows you to send hashed PII as parameters with your FB events. &#34;Automatic Advanced Matching&#34; can be enabled at any time via a toggle in the FB interface. I believe that setting autoConfig to false as mentioned above will similarly prevent Automatic Advanced Matching from working (since it disables the auto-creation of all those listeners to begin with). When manually triggering pixel calls like above, you can use this functionality via &#34;Manual Advanced Matching&#34;[3].As a general rule, I&#39;d strongly encourage anyone implementing a Facebook pixel to also include the autoConfig = false flag. This makes it work like most other pixels, where the base tag just instantiates an object. After which, hits only occur when explicitly defined in the site code, and include specifically what details you include in it. That way you&#39;re fully aware of the scope of data disclosure happening and any need from marketing to include sensitive (or potentially sensitive) information in these calls has to be explicitly requested (and theoretically vetted) as part of the standard dev process.[1] https://developers.facebook.com/docs/facebook-pixel/advanced...[2] https://www.facebook.com/business/help/611774685654668[3] https://developers.facebook.com/docs/facebook-pixel/advanced..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"One easy way to avoid this kind of mistake in your own product: make a clear distinction between your publicly-facing web site (&#34;corpweb&#34;) and your web app for logged-in users. Preferably, they should be served from separate infrastructure.Corpweb should be as static as possible, except for whatever third-party JS the marketing professionals think is necessary. It&#39;s their job, they know what&#39;s best.Your app should have zero third-party JS except for technical analytics (New Relic, Datadog, whatever).(This distinction can be fuzzier for free services, and for consumer stuff with non-sensitive data; Backblaze is neither of those.)"</p>

E-ink panels is where it&#39;s at, and a Raspberry Pi powering it is perfect.Unfortunately, the only real general-purpose e-ink tablet I&#39;m aware of is the Boox, but their models are all $400-800, which is way too expensive (when similar tech in a Kindle is $80).All I want is a relatively low-power, low-memory, low-storage touchscreen e-paper tablet (i.e. specs of an old Kindle) that I can run Linux and a WebKit browser on.And I want them to be cheap enough in bulk so that other companies and startups can build home devices on top of them to resell."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Huh. Like other commenters, I’m surprised to see a multi part JOIN be the answer for “I want the results of Query A as well as the results of Query B”.If anything, I think many folks would say “whatever, make the two requests in parallel and zip them together in the application”. If not, WITH expressions to make the two independent queries and then a final SELECT to merge them however you prefer would be reasonable (whether that’s a join flavor or UNION/INTERSECT/etc.), but the super explosion JOIN just doesn’t cross my mind.I think there must be a different example that they tried to anonymize for this post, otherwise they don’t need the IDs (and probably want a sum of quantity). If the author is around, what was the more realistic example behind:“In order to audit inventory, the logistics team at the corporate headquarters requests a tool that can generate a report containing all meal_items that left a given store’s inventory on a particular day. This requires a query that includes items that were both sold to customers as well as recorded as employee markouts for the specified store on the specified day.”?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Keep your matching logic simple.With SQL, matching is (by far) the most computationally expensive bit of most queries. Your goal should be to use only sargable[1] operators, and eliminate any functions, in all your WHERE clauses and JOINs.Complicated matching criteria will force the engine to make tough trade-off decisions, which can be affected by out-of-date table statistics, lousy indexes, and a million other things, and will often force the engine to rule-out more optimized algorithms and fall back to the cruder, primitive algorithms.[1] For most queries, &#34;OR&#34; is not usually a sargable operator: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sargable"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The author didn&#39;t mention the reason the query is slow.I dare to challenge that the non-optimal query is something that a person with advanced SQL skills would do. A seasoned engineer knows that by joining two tables, you are looking at, worst case, NxM comparisons.The problem is that you are joining the customers table with THREE other tables - the merged result of stores, employees and markouts. No matter how hard you try, you can&#39;t escape the fact that you are joining way more rows than just stores and customers.I would call it a layman issue SQL beginners learn the hard way. Advanced SQL users know the very basics of the db they are working with."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Please test their models before you take it at face value.Eleuther has a history of claiming to replicate projects when they haven&#39;t. For example, they shipped a DALL-E repo a few days after OpenAI announced it (https://twitter.com/theshawwn/status/1348017515897659392) which was broken, and they&#39;ve walked back their GPT-3 replication claims to replicating 1.5B due to the fact that their architecture doesn&#39;t scale.As far as I can tell, they&#39;re generating a large amount of hype with grandiose claims that they can&#39;t deliver on.All I care about is whether you like their models and actually use them in practice. If you do, please let me know and I&#39;ll pipe down. But so far, I haven&#39;t heard of anyone who uses anything they&#39;ve produced, and that worries me. Has anyone?One specific claim they made: https://twitter.com/BlancheMinerva/status/134727697554780980...&#34;DALL-E is quite straight forward and already coded. We just need data to train it.&#34;No, DALL-E is neither straightforward nor was it successfully coded, especially back on January 7th.Anyway, carry on. I really don&#39;t like speaking badly of AI projects, and I hope that they succeed. The model release today is a good step forward, assuming it works. But it might be better to have the expectation of &#34;the models don&#39;t work&#34; until proven otherwise.I&#39;d also like to point out that there are some capable people doing work at Eleuther. Sid in particular is one of the best TPU hackers in the scene. I just wish they would scale down their claims, release more models, and not claim that they&#39;ve done X until actually doing X. For example, the readme says they have &#34;the ability to scale up to full GPT3 sizes (and possibly more!), using the mesh-tensorflow library,&#34; which they don&#39;t."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is a nice release, but the title is a bit misleading as the released sizes (1.3B and 2.7B parameters) do not yet compare to the size of GPT-3 (175B), but rather GPT-2 (1.5B) instead (although future releases may have significantly more!).Edit: title improved, thank you!"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"A great start for a truly open approach. It&#39;s ironic that OpenAI isn&#39;t particularly open about its tech."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I have some recommendations for you as an EE graduate, you can club Digital Circuits and Systems, Embedded Systems and Digital Hardware with one book in one continuous course withthe book Digital Design and Computer Architecture by Harris and Harris (A RISC V Edition will release soon in 2-3 months, buy that one)For Electronic circuits choose Microelectronics by Behzad Razavi.  Instead of Purcell go for &#34;Engineering Electromagnetics with Ida&#34;, it is more intuitive.And th first book you should start with is &#34;Foundations of Analog and Digital Electronic Circuits&#34;Then you go for DDCA and Ida in parallel.The list does give me head scrather, this is too broad to be ever accomplished. My recommendation to redo the list is first find out what piques your interest in EE, Digital hardware, analog hardware or control systems or embedded systems and try to have a self study focus in that concentration.The way I see it with this plan you are setting yourself up for failure.Edit:Removed the ditching recommendation as I see it relevant to OP&#39;s goals."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Why push yourself through a degree-style path? So much of what EEs learn in their coursework is of low utility. (I&#39;m a physicist who transitioned to working as an EE. I have never had a single EE course, and yet I find myself with no obvious deficits compared to my colleagues who have.)There are two ways to learn an existing technical-ish subject: you can spend a lot of time reading textbooks, then  do some projects (the &#34;slow-fast&#34; approach); or you can dive in to projects and refer to textbooks when you get stuck (the &#34;start-stop&#34; approach). In the slow-fast approach you will go slowly through a lot of textbooks for a long time, and then in theory you will be able to do projects very quickly once you are done. In the start-stop approach you will start a project, quickly get stuck and spend a while searching for and understanding the answer, then go back to your project.In my opinion electrical engineering, being a subject where fast feedback is generally possible, is very well suited to project-first learning. I would recommend grabbing a few textbooks (Horowitz and Hill&#39;s Art of Electronics holding pole position for a practically-oriented learner, in my opinion), reading their introductory material (table of contents, preface, etc.; enough that you know what each book has in it), and then setting all the books aside until you need them. Avoid books targeted at &#34;makers&#34;; most are fine but a sizeable fraction are written by people with no clue what they are doing, and they will actively set you back. (It is very difficult to learn from an author who does not themself understand the subject, and all the worse if they do not realize that they do not understand. Since there are plenty of better sources out there, it&#39;s little trouble to just avoid the whole class.)Trying to work on brain-computer interfaces is challenging because it blends biology with electrical engineering. The biology will naturally drive things, because you cannot really control it like you can the electronics. So learning EE in this context is about two things: 1) What can I do with circuits? and 2) What do organisms behave like and respond to electrically? Your project is then using your knowledge of circuits to solve R&amp;D problems relating to bioelectric signals.This isn&#39;t easy (I think you know that), but the benefit is that you can quit with &#34;just&#34; EE skills and still come out ahead."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I used to build BMI systems in graduate school, from the lowest level (mixed-signal analog design for 70 uV extracelleular signals) to DSP (128 DSPs doing real time analysis) to the network (built my own ethernet MAC, foolishly!) to all the vis and RT-linux-based analysis. I left the area and switched into ML in grad school, but if I had to do it all over again there&#39;s one thing I think is missing:Optics. Optics optics optics.A tremendous amount of neural interfacing, especially in non-human primates and other organisms, is done via optics. ~All the advances in neural data acquisition over the past decade have been optical. Microscopy is the future for a tremendous amount of neuroscience and more and more people are considering it seriously for human-scale BMI.I know optics isn&#39;t always thought of in an EE context, but it should be! Many people doing amazing computational imaging and optics work are in EE departments. Computational imaging is the new hotness and can let you combine your existing CS skills with signal processing and optics to do things like build a lensless camera! https://waller-lab.github.io/DiffuserCam/If I were you I would ditch the RF part of your plan and study optics. Yeah, it&#39;s all EM, but the order-of-magnitude differences in the frequencies involved makes the underlying engineering quite different."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Beautiful times. I especially loved swapping - that is you got a list of people and their addresses from a magazine and you saved on disks your favourite demos and zines (preferable those nobody else had) and then you added some random stuff for example label off your favourite drink, wrote some poems, maybe added a dried flower and so on and then you also added postage stamps. Then you were hoping that whoever received it on the other side liked it and he or she would have sent you something else. Sometimes you would just just pass on the disks you received and just added your name to a txt file or some funny looking directory. There was also a trick to put a glue over your stamps and it was the custom that the person would send you those stamps back so you could then dissolve the postage stamp and reuse them :-)
The internet somewhat killed this unfortunately.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"A big part of the problem is people just not following the guidelines. If you have a toolbar with buttons that have labels, it’s not going to fit. But if you’re following the guidelines, you don’t have labels and it fits.If you have a list with a refresh button on the bottom you have to scroll to see that button on a small screen. But if you use the standard pull to refresh control, you don’t even need the button.If you use these smart hamburger menu overlay or scroll controls, they look bad on untested devices. Don’t use hamburger menus.Most of the screenshots in this article are from iOS apps that show Google Material Design. It’s not too surprising this doesn’t work properly on Apple devices, the design doesn’t fit and you can’t implement it using the toolkit Apple designed, built and tested to work on all their devices.Edit:By the way you don’t even need to get a tiny phone to test this because most of the problems also show up when you increase the operating system font size which you’re also supposed to test."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The Google Maps thing isn’t entirely about screen size (though I would hope it wouldn’t be quite so bad on larger screens—but I’m only familiar with how it looks on a small-by-modern-standards Android phone, where it’s about the same as on the iPhone depicted in this article, or even a little less); it’s about the product’s overarching philosophy, which has changed over the past decade (in a direction I strongly dislike). It used to be about, y’know, maps, but maps are now incidental, a means to a different end, ably demonstrated by their icon change a year ago from a map to a location pin. It’s all about the destinations now, and mapping has progressively deteriorated and been deemphasised.At least in the case depicted, you should be able to get it to show just the map by tapping once in the map area.(If you’re interested in more about this, https://www.justinobeirne.com has some excellent long-form content analysing all the major maps products, how they’ve changed over time, &amp;c. https://www.justinobeirne.com/google-maps-new-app-icon and https://www.justinobeirne.com/what-happened-to-google-maps are good brief starting points.)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"One thing that really annoyed me who always preferred the smaller iPhones like the SE: When Apple updated their Music app to make everything super big and bloated it basically got unusable. Especially for classical music where you could not see past the long name of the symphony to see which movement it was. And even while playing you had to wait for the running text to reach the important part.And all this was just blown up, they did not have to cram in a lot of infos they just increased the size of every UI element, made fonts bigger and bolt. It was really poor design, it felt like a phone for the elderly. Also one feature was gone that the old Music app had which would&#39;ve helped here: hold down on a song to get the overlay of the whole name...In general classical music is really poorly supported by many music services and apps but this was such a huge annoyance that I had to switch to a third party app and delete that shitty Music app."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The followup tweet indicates that the CPU has to be in an unlocked state before this is possible, which on a typical system requires there to be a Management Engine vulnerability first. Given what we currently know, this is going to be interesting for people interested in researching the behaviour and security of Intel CPUs and might well lead to discovery of security issues in future, but in itself I don&#39;t think this is dangerous.Edit to add: https://www.intel.com/content/dam/www/public/us/en/security-... is a discussion of a previous Intel security issue which includes a description (on page 6) of the different unlock levels. This apparently requires that the CPU be in the Red unlock state, which (in the absence of ME vulnerabilities) should only be accessible by Intel."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Nothing against the original post (which just says what they found), but this seems to be really overblown. Yes, of course Intel has instructions to update the micro code, since that&#39;s a thing that they do. Neither is it particularly surprising that they didn&#39;t bother to document operations that only they would ever have reason to use (in their eyes). If, as sibling comment notes, you have to be in a specific unlocked state to use this instruction, it should be perfectly safe assuming someone hasn&#39;t compromised other layers of security. So yes, this is certainly interesting, and it could be used as part of a chain of exploits to do some really nasty things, but by itself this seems like barely news?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Look up &#34;Intel VISA&#34; if you want to go down one of the many rabbitholes of undocumented x86... it makes me sad that there are whole subsystems in the hardware whose documentation is not publicly available; not from the security perspective, but from the &#34;I bet someone could do some really interesting things with this functionality&#34; perspective, like what LOADALL enabled (unreal mode, real-mode paging, etc.) decades ago.Intel isn&#39;t alone; search &#34;9c5a203a&#34; for some equally interesting stuff on the AMD side."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The video is worth a watch: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=antLneVlxcsI think it&#39;s fair to say that there are definitely some sketchy moments in there. The one that surprised me the most was marked &#34;Near Collision (2)&#34; in the video (12:25). A car really close to the Tesla doesn&#39;t seem to be picked up at all until it&#39;s too late: https://i.imgur.com/BG0gN2R.jpegYou can see in the first frame there that on the screen there&#39;s nothing in front of the Tesla, it&#39;s just the usual white background. But right out the windshield we can see the car is already very close. At the bottom frame which is a split second later, the car is finally detected and we can see the screen now shows the car. But at that point the driver manually intervened with a sharp swerve right as they were about to hit the car. Going frame by frame on Youtube the green box indicating the car was only there for 4 frames before the driver disengaged.I was aware that self driving is far from ready but I didn&#39;t know that even basic detection stuff like this is buggy. Double parked cars, people walking in the street, etc, I would expect to be problematic. But this is not really an edge case, it&#39;s just a regular car at close range with no obstructions in between..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"December 2015: &#34;We&#39;re going to end up with complete autonomy, and I think we will have complete autonomy in approximately two years.&#34;January 2016: &#34;In ~2 years, summon should work anywhere connected by land &amp; not blocked by borders, eg you&#39;re in LA and the car is in NY&#34;June 2016: &#34;I really consider autonomous driving a solved problem, I think we are less than two years away from complete autonomy, safer than humans, but regulations should take at least another year,&#34; Musk said.March 2017: &#34;I think that [you will be able to fall asleep in a tesla] is about two years&#34;March 2018: &#34;I think probably by end of next year [end of 2019] self-driving will encompass essentially all modes of driving and be at least 100% to 200% safer than a person.&#34;Nov 15, 2018: &#34;Probably technically be able to [self deliver Teslas to customers doors] in about a year then its up to the regulators&#34;Feb 19 2019: &#34;We will be feature complete full self driving this year. The car will be able to find you in a parking lot, pick you up, take you all the way to your destination without an intervention this year. I&#39;m certain of that. That is not a question mark. It will be essentially safe to fall asleep and wake up at their destination towards the end of next year&#34;April 12th 2019: &#34;I&#39;d be shocked if not next year, at the latest that having the person, having human intervene will decrease safety. DECREASE! (in response to human supervision and adding driver monitoring system)&#34;April 22nd 2019: &#34;We expect to be feature complete in self driving this year, and we expect to be confident enough from our standpoint to say that we think people do not need to touch the wheel and can look out the window sometime probably around the second quarter of next year.&#34;April 22nd 2019: “We will have more than one million robotaxis on the road,” Musk said. “A year from now, we’ll have over a million cars with full self-driving, software... everything.&#34;May 9th 2019: &#34;We could have gamed an LA/NY Autopilot journey last year, but when we do it this year, everyone with Tesla Full Self-Driving will be able to do it too&#34;Dec 1, 2020: “I am extremely confident of achieving full autonomy and releasing it to the Tesla customer base next year. But I think at least some jurisdictions are going to allow full self-driving next year.”-Elon’s just been repeating the same promise for the over half a decade now. Oldest trick in the book.Disclaimer: I drive a Model 3"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This [0] is much worse than the video in the article, IMO. It repeatedly tries to pull out in front of cars going 45+ miles an hour, in some cases giving the driver very little time to stop it. For level 5 (what Elon keeps claiming they will have very soon), they need to be able to go tens of thousands of miles without a crash-avoiding human intervention, not 10 minutes.[0] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uClWlVCwHsI"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I built a print-on-demand system that integrates into Shopify stores. To vent a little...* I can concur that their API is unreliable. About 1 in 5 of my CI runs fail with mysterious 500 errors. It&#39;s infuriating.* The support channels are a wasteland. Do not expect help.* The documentation is super thin. At first glance it looks decent - there&#39;s the objects, there&#39;s the fields those objects have. But it&#39;s missing all the details about how those fields are supposed to work. Example: A Fulfillment has a tracking_numbers array, but there doesn&#39;t seem to be any way to add multiple tracking numbers. The docs are silent, and questions about this in the support channels remain unanswered. For years.* There are two completely different APIs (graphql and REST), which do not have equal capabilities. If Shopify is planning on deprecating one of them, they should give us guidance.* The API is inconsistent. I count at least FIVE different representations of an Address structure, each slightly different for no apparent reason. Eg &#34;country&#34; vs &#34;countryCode&#34;. This is the kind of thing that creeps into projects in dynamic languages when nobody&#39;s paying attention.* There&#39;s a lot of overengineered stuff. The Metadata API  is really unpleasant compared to Stripe&#39;s simpler approach.* There&#39;s no way to set up common shipping scenarios like &#34;$N for first item, $M for each additional&#34;.I could go on. But I will say this: It&#39;s better than Etsy&#39;s API. Though Etsy is finally working on it again, so maybe that will change."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;ve been building Shopify apps for around 5 years now, and have 4 apps with around 15k users. I feel the pain this author feels with some additional notes..Our apps are built in PHP using the polaris.css for styling components. We have some embedded apps currently (before Shopify began requiring the session token). Personally, the embedded experience is only good for simpler apps. If your app is more complex with lots of options and settings and things to show, the embedded experience is SO SMALL. Literally 40% of the screen is taken up by the Shopify admin leaving only a small portion for your app. Makes interface design more difficult when so much of the top/left part of the screen is taken up by Shopify admin.Their API and webhooks are &#34;fairly&#34; reliable. We&#39;re consuming around 10k to 20k webhooks per hour and performing 20k to 50k API calls per hour. We rarely have issues. We are using their Amazon EventBridge integration to accept webhooks as a sort of buffer against them DDOSing our applications.The largest issue with their API at scale is dealing with the API limits of 2 to 4 requests per second. Since some things require performing multiple API calls, and we deal with massive e-commerce stores that may need to perform 100,000 tasks, it can take a long time to perform the work (we have to artificially delay the API calls to not hit their limits). Also their GraphQL API has a complex limit system based on the &#34;amount&#34; of data returned, which makes fetching data even more complicated than their REST API.My other big gripe with their API is that they have a GraphQL and REST API with different features. They support different filters, different fields they return, different types of objects... It&#39;s a real PITA to try and work seamlessly between two different APIs (e.g. data formatted differently). And neither API is 100% solid, depending on the features your app needs you will basically need to use both APIs.Generally my experience has been pretty good with Shopify. Their API changes can be scary, but at least they use versioning so they don&#39;t break the current version you&#39;re using. They are constantly adding new features too."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"My biggest problem with the ecosystem is how Shopify tries to deflect their own customer problems onto their partners to solve. And oftentimes, these same customers expect the partners to solve it for free.Examples:- Their default theme (provided by Shopify) has problems. Blame it on the app developer. &#34;It&#39;s the app&#39;s fault.&#34; Yes, there are some poorly developed apps, but this lumps together the good with the bad.- Customers use the app review system to hold developer hostage for feature requests. &#34;Create this feature for us and I&#39;ll edit my review.&#34;- Shopify&#39;s customer service reps says, &#34;It must be the app that&#39;s causing this.&#34; Reading the CSR&#39;s emails, it is clear that this person does not understand the (technical) issues and is only trying to close the ticket. Customer takes what the CSR says as gospel and you, as the developer, spends a lot of time trying to fight that mindset.I can&#39;t help but feel a big part of Shopify&#39;s early strategy was that the demographic of customers they were trying to attract just weren&#39;t a great type of customer, and that the partner program allowed them to enlist a lot of hungry developers willing to work for free (or next to nothing).There is definitely room for improvement. I have mixed feelings about it, as their ecosystem provided me with a way to make a living many years ago. I don&#39;t depend on them anymore, but I wouldn&#39;t argue against trying your luck out there if you&#39;re starting out. Just recognize that there is a certain culture and way of practice there."</p>

I don&#39;t see why that is confusing at all.&#34;Here, yyy has correct one and three significant digits relative to xxx, but incorrect 2 significant digits, since the truncation at x2x_2x2  and y2y_2y2  do not agree even to the first significant digit. &#34;This doesn&#39;t make sense. Y has the correct one?I think you might be confused about the purpose of significant digits. SD are intended to be paired with a tolerance. If there is no tolerence quote with the number, it is meaningless to talk about significant digits. You arbitrarily defined the tolerance as +/0.5 (half a unit). That is not always true, almost never true. Consider test equipment, not every multimeter is going to be +/0.5mV, some might be +/-.3uV. It varies."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"My rule of thumb is that anything title &#34;...for Hackers&#34; is crap.This link was not an exception.&gt;  Since the relative error is invariant under scaling (x↦αx)(x \mapsto \alpha x)(x↦αx), we will mostly be interested in relative error.No, No, No, No. This is very much dependent on what you are measuring/modelling, what is the tolerance you are willing to accept, the consequences and so on.A 1% of error in the change the cashier gave you back maybe is not a big deal. That same error in the national budget is equivalent to 2X the NASA&#39;s budget."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is such a great example of how people that know math(s) really struggle to explain things to people who don&#39;t, because they struggle to realise how much lingo they are using.The first point explains something as basic as absolute and relative errors. Great.1 page down (s)he&#39;s casually thrown in function notation with R representing the real numbers with no explanation. Anyone who isn&#39;t familiar with this notation is immediately intimidated. But I&#39;d wager almost anyone who is familiar with it didn&#39;t need to read the page before it. But also, I think it&#39;s just unnecessary to be this specific in the first place, if you&#39;re trying to quickly explain concepts.It&#39;s actually a huge problem in maths and even Wikipedia (I feel) is pretty guilty of this.If you take a (relatively) key mathematical concept, such as the Taylor series, then the opening gambit is completely incomprehensible to anyone who isn&#39;t already knowledgeable in maths: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taylor_seriesThis, to me, seems in huge contrast with other scientific fields. Medicine wikipedia, for example, caters towards the &#34;average reader&#34; first, and doctors later. This is entirely appropriate for an encyclopedia. For example: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AV_nodal_reentrant_tachycardia..."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Misleading Title. Visa says it will allow for Bitcoin to be converted to fiat, and the fiat can be spent using a Visa Card in the same way debit cards already work.This is already done with the Coinbase card, Gemini card, etcThe statement is very vague in terms of who is covering the conversion."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The number of people commenting who completely misunderstand Bitcoin and crypto is astounding.Bitcoin will never be used directly for payments, it&#39;s a value store. Immutable deflationary digital gold.I wrote it off for years too because it was too slow and the fees were too expensive. That was the dream they had, but they couldn&#39;t realize it at the base layer. I was still walking around last year believing that&#39;s the scam they were still peddling, but once you take time to investigate you&#39;ll see it will become a major part of the world economy.COVID helped push this over as bailouts and printing money in the US and the ECB is going to drive a massive movement of money out of the markets and fiat.Normally you&#39;d see momentum go to bonds when the stocks burst but the bonds situation is unsalvagable.Also expect a ton of movement to crypto when wealth taxes get implemented to fix economies. They&#39;ll use it to hide assets, guaranteed. Form an LLC, siphon the money out that way and into crypto."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"One of the reasons I&#39;m bullish on Bitcoin over the next decade is precisely because of the anti-BTC sentiment on this board."</p>
