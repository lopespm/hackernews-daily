								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"During my time as a research assistant / grad student there was a remarkable shift in the atmosphere. It started with massive layoffs of research staff, linked to the more general savings of our government.More esoteric professors were replaced with more efficient manuscript machines submitting manuscripts to more prestigious journals. Soon after the layoffs, the university&#39;s innovation and commercialization services became extremely active. Recurring events at lecture rooms where we were blasted on how our work is IP of the university, how the university takes only 50% cut if something works, how cool is it to be a researcher who commercializes ideas in comparison to being one those dusty farts in the science cave studying one protein or butterfly for their entire life.Being a believer and practitioner of open source, I once asked how does this all this apply to computational science. Basically all algorithms and tools should be passed through them to see if they have commercial potential - if no, we can go ahead. Found it appalling and interfering with my intellectual freedom, one of the many events that made me pursue life outside the academia."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Wouldn&#39;t be the first time universities have acted like patent trolls. For example, you know the filament-style LED lightbulbs that are really popular these days? The University of California has been going after a bunch of retailers with patent lawsuits for selling them, complete with PR push about how it was their invention that had been stolen from them. I looked at what they&#39;d actually invented and patented at the time, and it was nothing like those filament LED lightbulbs - it was a old-fashioned resin-dome LED that replaced the metal anvil the die is usually mounted on with a TIR reflector, supposedly to improve efficiency. This was completely impractical, pointless and had no market value - the metal anvil is really useful both as mechanical support and a heatsink, you&#39;d almost certainly lose any possible efficiency gain that resulted from capturing more of the rear light output due to higher temperatures. However, they&#39;d worded their patent claims in such a broad way that they could cover nearly anything, and the university used this to file for patents that were actually similar to the LED filaments after they&#39;d already been invented by someone else and put on the market but backdated in validity to their original patent.This isn&#39;t just a software-related problem."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Grants from the NSF, etc. should only be granted on the condition that the research produced enters the public domain. Taxpayer dollars should not go towards producing research the public cannot benefit from without paying to license a patent or access a $100 journal article."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Starting conditions (where one was born, levels of wealth and opportunity there, one&#39;s parents&#39; education and jobs) are shockingly predictive about an individual&#39;s future. Hard work leading to social mobility has always been the exception, not the rule. Most will not beat the odds since if they did, those wouldn&#39;t BE the odds. A lot of us are just so deluded by survivorship bias borne of listening only to success stories, but it seems more and more people are seeing through the illusion. In my opinion, that&#39;s a good thing, as recognizing the true state of things is the first step to improving them, and this combination of consciousness and lived experience can prove to be potent immunization against bad faith actors who want to maintain the illusion of widespread social mobility."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Working hard but doing so for someone else can often not lead to significant gains.  Many services like Uber or InstaCart or even McDonalds or Amazon Warehouse or Walmart or Retail Sales or call center, you can work hard but there is no where to progress to.  Your rewards are capped.You need to find a way to work hard such that your rewards are not capped artificially.  Startups were you get equity.  Large companies where you can progress to high salaries if you are able to rise.  Starting your own business and being competent at it.  Working on commissions in an area where the commissions can be large -- true sales, or real estate.  Being a professional, e.g. doctor, accountant, lawyer, has traditionally had high wages and you often run your own business.You need to work hard in a way that has unlimited rewards, or at least high rewards possible, and that aligns with your aptitudes.You need to not work hard at a minimum wage job if you can get something better.And if you are stuck in a minimum wage job, maybe you can organize with your fellow employees to demand better wages and benefits?  This is also another way of working hard in order to get more for yourself."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"As trite as it sounds, &#34;Success = Hard Work + Opportunity&#34; is still the default equation that makes the most sense to me.And while people from all strata of life work very hard, opportunities are obviously and incredibly unequally distributed (and perhaps becoming more so?).If you were born middle-class in US/Canada 20 - 40 years ago, your access to opportunities to improve your station were/are immense. Layer on your ethnicity, if your parents were in a stable relationship, if you grew up in relative safety, if you had a decent education... hard not to think that your opportunities were 10x or 100x someone who had none of those things.But you also need to define &#34;success&#34;. To this crowd, is &#34;success&#34; merely &#34;leading a better life&#34;? I&#39;d argue most of us already have this as our default reality. I.e. the gradual reward for working hard via promotions and relative safety of career.I remember after my startup was acquired, a few people would say to me (well-meaning obviously) &#34;wow it&#39;s great your hard work paid off!&#34;. And I just said something like &#34;thanks, ya, lots of people work a lot harder than me but didn&#39;t get the same outcome - so there was a lot of luck involved too!&#34; etc. Even thinking of my own immigrant grandparents - what THEY did was HARD.I think about those exchanges often. Tech -- at this particular moment in history -- disproportionately rewards &#34;hard work&#34; (which many of us find fun anyways). Or perhaps better to say that Tech provides access to the right kind of opportunities that allow for a DEFAULT &#34;life gets better&#34;, with the possibilities of &#34;life suddenly gets 100x better&#34;."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I&#39;m always super intrigued by the reMarkable 2, but I think it&#39;s because it paints an image of the type of person I think it&#39;d be cool to be, someone who can just write down notes and draw stuff with a really cool, slim device. Someone who carries around moleskines and uses them, instead of just buying so many of them in different shapes and leaving them in a drawer packed to the brim with notebooks.The problem keeps coming back to the fact that I&#39;m absolutely not the type of person who wants to carry that thing around everywhere and who likes or is good at hand writing or drawing. I realize I won&#39;t base all my life and processes around this one device that is also supposedly hard to get info off of easily into things like OneNote. If I was somewhere without a computer, then I wouldn&#39;t be carrying this big tablet on me. I&#39;ve bought enough tablets and laptops with writable screens and MS surfaces over the years to know that I still never drew or took notes with the pen, but I still keep buying them hoping I will.The thing is still so cool and I want it, but maybe I&#39;ll wait for version 3 or 4 and extra disposable income that will go to waste on it!"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I bought a Remarkable 2 a month or two ago because I wanted a cool hackable e-ink Linux computer. But instead I immediately started using it as an e-book and document reader and note-taking pad, and nothing else. And, so far at least, that&#39;s perfect.The screen is beautiful (a bit gray, but the black is really black so the contrast is still good), the device is thin and reasonably light, I only have to charge it once a week or so, and there are absolutely no distractions. I have even rediscovered the visceral pleasantness of writing by hand.I especially like that it&#39;s *not* running Android (which I dislike more with each release). The biggest drawbacks, to me, are the fragile pen nibs and the inability to just SCP a PDF or EPUB to the device and have it work (their sync software works but isn&#39;t great)."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I bought the Onyx Boox Note Air some months ago, and I must say that I&#39;m really happy with it. Screen refresh is good, there&#39;s almost no ghosting in default mode, and refresh rates are acceptable.There are only two downsides about it: The vendor does not respect FOSS and does not publish the sources for their modified Linux kernel, and the device constantly phones home to China. However, the device can be rooted easily [1], and you can install a firewall to stop the preloaded apps from phoning home (verified it with Wireshark).[1]: https://blog.tho.ms/hacks/2021/03/27/hacking-onyx-boox-note-..."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is a great example of why Google FLoC is not incentive-compatible with consumers nor business owners.  Amazon (like Facebook) has a monopoly on ad targeting on their target properties—- properties they own.  Google FLoC is Google’s attempt to (further) monopolize their target properties—- the web at large, which Google does NOT own.  Google does NOT pay to service the traffic they generate.  Google does NOT pay to fulfill consumer orders.  Google wants you to think they’re acting in your best interests with FLoC.  Maybe if Google offered more free GCloud credits and subsidized conversions they generate, that would be a different story. (Maybe Google could start by paying Wikipedia for some of the traffic they generate).  But Sundar wants you to think FLoC is about privacy, because Sundar has said time and time again that Google has lost people’s trust."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Wow, the bias in this article is unbelievably blatant:&#34;[Amazon is] preventing Google’s tracking system FLoC — or Federated Learning of Cohorts — from gathering valuable data reflecting the products people research in Amazon’s vast e-commerce universe&#34;Compare with, e.g.:&#34;Amazon is taking steps to protect its user&#39;s privacy by blocking Google&#39;s heavy-handed overreach in leveraging its Chrome browser to spy on user&#39;s personal shopping habits and sell that information to other retailers&#34;.(Note: I&#39;m not saying my rewrite is unbiased.  It&#39;s not.  It&#39;s just biased in a different direction to highlight the contrast.)"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"To me this editor gets it right in the sense that we don’t need to get rid of code as the “nocode” movement is trying. Instead we need to make coding more enjoyable and figure out ways to make it more interactive.One specific thing Utopia addresses to me is the need for the code and the actual thing to be treated more as one single interactable component and not two separate things.Instead we&#39;re treating the thing as a one-way compile step. There&#39;s no way to sync the DevTools in-memory changes we make to the DOM with the actual code.The fact that Utopia allows the two things to be treated as one is a huge step towards making webdev more enjoyable.And they’re following good steps… SwiftUI’s editor is very similar in this regard. Using the code as the main thing but having all kinds of interactable components around it that make writing code simpler with cool visual autocomplete widgets &amp; visual aids.Before with direct DOM changes building something like this was impossible but now with the React paradigm is seems natural to have this sync between code and visuals.Kudos to the team for pulling this off."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"After five minutes of playing with it and failing to find it... where is the panel of components to drag and drop into the tree? Seems like the most basic functionality in an editor like this. Something that VB had in 1993. This should be something that is obvious and visible on a first glance.Another issue I have with the UI is that a lot of elements are greyed out even though they remain interactive. The convention is that UI elements that are greyed out are not interactive due to the current state of the application (wrong mode, unmatched requisites etc). This application seems to violate that and I&#39;m still baffled as to what greying out of UI elements means in in this app. If they aren&#39;t disabled why are they greyed out?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Product designer here. I just spent the past few hours fine-tuning some visual details in our Figma component library. Now I need to file tickets for each change and work with our frontend developers to make sure the updated Figma details get properly mapped over to React.I&#39;ve grown numb to the friction, but I think this Utopia demo just reset my pain tolerance. Going back to manually mapping designs from Figma mocks to React components feels so dated. Almost like those PSD2HTML websites of the early 2000s.The market absolutely needs a product like this."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I can’t help but see some kind of special interest or agenda whenever I hear a news story now. You have to ask why they chose to report this, why they slant things one way or another with their choice of wording and emphasis. What is the aspect of this story that is too politically incorrect or unfashionable to be included?I have never researched a topic deeply and found that the media had been covering that topic accurately, ever. The harsh truth is that generally speaking the news is almost completely useless. You might as well just never watch it.I think the very final nail in the coffin was the leaked recordings of the CNN technical director basically admitting what everyone pretty much already knew. That they spread misinformation deliberately, only give interviews to subject experts who they know will say what CNN prefers them to say and ultimately design everything they put on the screen to get hooks inside your limbic system and keep your eyes glued. The main tool they use to do this is the emotion of fear, and it was for this reason and no other that they created a COVID death counter. And every single one of those points is explicitly, literally and plainly stated on video by a very senior employee of CNN for all to see. so I’m afraid that I can’t be brushed aside as a Russian bot. It’s right there on YouTube.And what about all the other media companies? This CNN leak, which is maybe the very embodiment of a scoop, was not on the front page of any major newspaper or news website. It was not elaborated on. It was basically not reported."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Anyone else burnt out from the outrage cycle in recent times?I don’t know if it’s selfish but I just don’t have the energy anymore to care about what bad thing person X or company Y did this week.My current philosophy is to treat news/Reddit/social media like email in the old days.That is: log on to a desktop computer once a week and read the highlights. It is not accessible except through the desktop computer.The funny thing is this approach is completely opposite the “stories” trend in social media. It makes you really aware of the FOMO-by-design pattern these days."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Bill Ackman runs a hedge fund and was a guest on CNBC right at the beginning of the US getting hit with the pandemic proclaiming travel industry going to go downhill while having made bets on that happening. [0] For those outside the US, CNBC is a business/financial/stock market news channel.&gt; “America will end as we know it. I’m sorry to say so, unless we take this option,” he told CNBC on March 18, five days before ending his bet against the market. “We need to shut it down now. ... This is the only answer.”He then made $2B a week later.  I would assume most guests on that network are there to make statements to try and sway the market in some way to their favor.

Publicly available information doesn&#39;t mean that you will whatever you want with it.Tomorrow, (already their OS, Android is doing it), they will collect everything about a person and this is going way beyond who has signed up for. This needs to stop. All in the name of providing services or improving lives of people. Who cares about the dark side? How much profiling has gone into the collected data? What kind of risks it may pose in the future?This needs to stop... the sooner the better...Everyone has the right to be private. It doesn&#39;t mean one has to throw away everything in public about them. Isn&#39;t?I know I might start another discussion thread, but I&#39;m sure there will be people who will battle for and against... But it doesn&#39;t matter..."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Nice to see turtle graphics mentioned in this context. Back when I learned to code, it was one of the more common teaching techniques, and I still believe that it&#39;s one of the most &#34;hands on&#34; ways to explain loops, recursion etc.As far as development environments - have you tried Thonny (https://thonny.org/)? It has some nice features in it that are specifically geared towards explaining how things work. For example, when you debug, you can step through subexpressions, and their values are automatically substituted in the editor as they are computed."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"FWIW if you are operating on an extremely small budget and want to do something like this, you can definitely hit up your local thrift shops (or craigslist) for very cheap used monitors.  I know that doesn&#39;t get you the Pi systems, but new monitors can be quite pricy."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Great post. And kudos to the groundbreaking work by Eben Upton and others in Cambridge, for giving the Raspberry PI to us so this kind of effort can now happen anywhere in the world at minimum cost.PyTurtle is a great library for educational use - I used it to teach 11-year-olds in Scotland how to draw a house. The approach take was: instruct pupils to draw a house on paper, using only straight lines; teach them briefly what a coordinate system is (assigning numeric addresses - pairs of numbers - to points), which they haven&#39;t had in their maths curriculum at that stage, but which they easily picked up; translate the paper-based house into a sequence of PyTurtle Python commands."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Considering that Stripe was originally known for letting websites accept credit card payments without seeing your credit card number, one might assume that Stripe Identity only allows websites to see the verification result, and not your selfies and scans of your identity documents.That would be an incorrect assumption.  Per https://support.stripe.com/questions/managing-your-id-verifi... customers of Stripe Identity have API access to &#34;captured images of the ID document, selfies, extracted data from the ID document, keyed-in information, and the verification result&#34;.Thus, when you use Stripe Identity to verify your identity, you have to trust that:1. The website doesn&#39;t download, retain, and later leak your selfie and identity information.2. The website&#39;s Stripe API token isn&#39;t compromised and exploited by identity thieves to access your selfie and identity information.Stripe appears to be leaning heavily on their claim that they don&#39;t disclose &#34;biometric identifiers&#34; to websites and that these &#34;biometric identifiers&#34; are deleted from their systems within 48 hours. This is extremely deceptive considering that biometric identifiers can be reconstructed from the selfie."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The landing page contains logos for clubhouse, discord, and shippo, which are presumably companies use the service. Does anyone find those usages to be unnecessarily intrusive? Maybe it&#39;s just me, but a chat app or shipping site asking me for a drivers license scan + selfie would make me never want to use the service again. It&#39;s appalling how this sort of stuff is getting normalized, eg. google asking for id scans for age verification."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Smart. Banks haven&#39;t been allowed to monetize their KYC data, but this new non-bank class of payments companies have this opportunity. Interac has been trying to do this for many years.Some years ago I worked on a system let banks do identity assertions with proofs via SAML attributes instead of sharing customer PII. It is now a federation of banks in wide use for govt services in Canada. The use cases were really limited because the federation partners were too conservative to extend the identity services to relying party consumer applications real people actually wanted to use, and institutional sales cycles meant product feedback was glacial, so it has existed for over a decade in this relative backwater of gov-tech. I think identity companies have mostly failed to get traction because of a terminal lack of consumer sexiness, whereas Stripe has the jelly.Other companies in the identity space have been working on protocols and platforms, but none of them had a user base to extend an identity federation services into, which means they have never been able to make a real or viable product, just interesting techs. An internet payment provider with young consumer traction getting into identity is a Very Big Deal.It&#39;s going to position Stripe to knock out a lot of retail banks who can&#39;t offer similar services. Imo, this could make them bigger than Apple."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&gt; Surveys show anywhere from 25% to upwards of 40% of workers are thinking about quitting their jobs.This number is meaningless without previous year trends. In my circles, everyone from 25-35 is simultaneously preparing to FIRE and no-one that&#39;s 35+ has actually changed jobs despite being &#39;financially independent&#39;. Expressing intent to resign, and actually resigning are completely different things. (edit: to clarify, I mean changing jobs specifically in the context of making inroads toward the retire early portion of their goal. Changing jobs to increase compensation is as strong as ever)Real Translation: Covid has made people miserable in their jobs. The only way people can keep going is idle fantasies about a nondescript future date where this suffering ends.&gt; Workers have had more than a year to reconsider work-life balance or career pathsIMO, over the last year, people have only dived deeper into their delusions and relative sense of privilege. Suddenly, having good health insurance, WFH &#39;flexibility&#39; and a stable jobs are now being viewed as things to be grateful about rather than the norm for well educated and employable adults.&gt; &#34;Hopefully we’ll see a lot more people in 2022 employed and stable because they&#39;re in jobs they actually like,&#34; she says.Press &#39;X&#39; to Doubt"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I can tell you all the market for devs is white hot at the moment. I mean it was never cold, but right now seems to be insane.If the work-from-home thing has given you thoughts about what you like, now is the time to go. I see very few firms insisting on onsite work though, having interviewed with quite a few over the last few weeks. Even guys that I know would rather have people in the office and would pay them very well are feeling forced to let people work from home at least a couple of days.Salary wise it seems like it&#39;s breaking upwards too, though of course all I have is my own offers and the word of some recruiters. There&#39;s also just a lot of firms out there who are happy to create roles for people they like, or discuss new ventures with new people.Also, don&#39;t forget if you&#39;re going to look, absolutely everyone is interviewing remotely. You can sit at home at interviews all day until you find the job for you, something you might not be able to once more firms go back in the office."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"They want us back in the office July 16... I&#39;m going to pass so found a new remote role with higher salary and equity. I will be part of this wave. I didn&#39;t realy even try with how insane the market is especially if you are specialzed in the current hotness.Moreso, the rise of fully remote role has opened up our ideas about our current living situation. The real estate market in our city is shattered and broken. So we will also move 60 miles south to a different city... before the pandemic I was remote and missed the office. Post pandemic... fuck the office and 1+ hour commutes purely because the city, state, and country have mismanaged infrastructure for 20 years."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;ve used this to provide simple UIs to scripts for consulting projects where something more complex wasn&#39;t justified.It mostly works great. If you have a complicated UI with multi-selects, validations and default selections, it probably isn&#39;t for you. But if you really just need a desktop UI for a script, it does what it says. You can make a UI in a few minutes.There&#39;s also Wooey - a web-based take on the same idea if you need a Django web app to queue up and run your scripts. That implementation is a little more janky, but it also mostly works."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"So, it looks really cool, but it requires wxpython, which in turn seems to be an issue installing on Linux.  Which, since I&#39;m using Ubuntu 20.04 (not an exotic flavor of Linux) and python3, was surprising to me, but it appears to be a common issue (lots of blog posts saying lots of different ways to get around this).  Might be useful to make some docs on how to install on the most common flavors of Linux?  If this already exists, my apologies, I didn&#39;t see it."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This appears to actually go significantly beyond enforced password disclosure.  From the text ( http://www.justice.ie/en/JELR/Gen_Scheme_of_AGS_(Powers)_Bil... ), on Head 16 (p 28):- An officer can use these requirements on anyone who &#34;appears to him or her to have access&#34;.  They don&#39;t appear to need any evidence beyond that.  The person does not need to be a suspect or, it appears, the subject of a warrant, just a person present at the location subject to the search warrant.- It applies not just to access to information on the device, but information &#34;which can be accessed by the use of that computer&#34;, and thus presumably includes information that is on other machine, or potentially not even in Ireland or the EU.- It allows officers to freely operate computers on site during a search (this seems like horrible forensic practice?), and use passwords found on the site to try to access any information accessible from the computer.- It does not just include disclosing passwords.  It includes &#34;any password or encryption key&#34;, and anything &#34;to otherwise enable [the officer] to examine the information accessible by the computer&#34;.- It even appears that it allows officers to compel people not just to disclose passwords but to actually operate the device for them so as to enable information access, and &#34;to produce the information in a form in which it can be removed&#34;.- It is not clear to me that there is any restriction on the scope of information, so long as it is in some way accessible.- Head 17 appears to allow even legally (or otherwise) privileged information to be seized, so long as &#34;the confidentiality of the material can be maintained pending the determination by the court of the issue as to whether the material is privileged material&#34;.Combining these powers would seem to be able to result in ridiculous situations, for example, forcing a person to take data from a US server using an SSH key on their laptop, potentially violating US law by doing so, and for the person to do all the work necessary to do this themselves."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Interestingly, such a law does nothing against proper criminals. People that know they have incriminating evidence will either not carry it on their phones or uses some form of steganography to hide it perfectly. In the worst case, they will have some form of wipe-me passphrase that cleans the device before unlocking.Normal people, on the other hand, do not have these kind of (mental, time) resources. They will be forced to unlock their phones and something incriminating (for instance regarding &#34;hate speech&#34; or &#34;intellectual property rights&#34; or just &#34;traffic violations&#34;) will be found. I consider this approach one step more in the direction of keeping every citizen an on-demand criminal. There are so many, sometimes incomprehensible, laws nowadays that pretty much everyone is not compliant."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Here&#39;s a fun fact! If you appear to the police officer to have access or passwords, and don&#39;t give it to them, they can charge you with obstruction and jail you for up to 5 years!So if you can&#39;t prove that you don&#39;t have the password, you&#39;re in a bit of trouble!-------------------------------------16 (1).(e).(v) to require any person at that place who appears to him or her to have access to or to have under his power or control the information held in any such computer or which can be accessed by the use of that computer—(I) to give  to  him  or  her  any  password  or  encryption  key  necessary  to operate it,(II) to otherwise enable him or her to examine the information accessible by the computer in a form in which the information is visible and legible,(III) to produce the information in a form in which it can be removed and in which it is, or can be made, visible and legible67 (2).(d) A person who fails to comply with a requirement under Head 9 (1), (2) or (3), or Head 16 (1). is guilty of an offence and is liable—(i)  on  summary  conviction,  to  a  class  A  fine  or  imprisonment  for  a  term  not exceeding 12 months or both, or(ii) on conviction on indictment, to a fine not exceeding €30,000 or imprisonment for a term not exceeding 5 years or both"</p>

Which programs work for me? Or, I have {goal} and n days per week, what should I do? The programs would be populated with exercises from the DB, programs could be exported, etc.3. As much ELI5 info as possible - the barrier to exercise for a lot of people (myself included despite my experience) can be not knowing wtf something is, or why to do it, and generally what the benefits are.4. Treat warmups like any exercise - a critical part of the routine. Include lots of warm up exercises, whether it&#39;s something you make quantifiable progress with or not. Everything from skipping rope and light jogging to dead bugs. Include these as part of program generation.Maybe something does this, but my favourite tracker (Strong) doesn&#39;t cover all of it and I&#39;d switch in an instant if something did. I like the idea of switching programs every year or so, experimenting with warm ups, having convenient access to understanding programs and lifts better, etc. As it is, working out requires a crazy amount of research.

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I was wondering if https://musclewiki.com/ was going to pop up. My wife had just sent it to me earlier this week.It lets you pick gender, muscle group, exercise type (stretch, bodyweight, barbell, dumbbells, kettlebells) and has detailed instructions and videos. (It does not have sets/reps like the shared site.) Perhaps they would be good to use in tandem.Personally, I think for sets/reps, it follows most exercise advice. Choose what you&#39;ll actually do. If that&#39;s 3 sets of 5 reps, fine. Do that. If you can get yourself to consistently do more than that over time, you&#39;ll benefit from the increase in volume. (When I&#39;m active, I follow Starting Strength style - increase warm-up weight while decreasing reps; then a bunch of working weight sets.)"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Social and Economic Effects of the [Bubonic] PlagueSince it was so difficult (and dangerous) to procure goods through trade and to produce them, the prices of both goods produced locally and those imported from afar skyrocketed. Because of illness and death workers became exceedingly scarce, so even peasants felt the effects of the new rise in wages. The demand for people to work the land was so high that it threatened the manorial holdings. Serfs were no longer tied to one master; if one left the land, another lord would instantly hire them.https://www.brown.edu/Departments/Italian_Studies/dweb/plagu..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"By “quitting” they mostly mean getting new jobs or career changes. Not necessarily refusing to work in an office. The headline is misleading.It’s also still a relatively small number in absolute terms:&gt; In April, the share of U.S. workers leaving jobs was 2.7%, according to the Labor Department, a jump from 1.6% a year earlier to the highest level since at least 2000.The higher turnover is expected in a booming economy like the one we’re in.These articles with hyperbolic headlines and underwhelming actual data are very common right now. It feels like the journalists want us to believe some sort of revolution is happening, be it WFH or remote work or people quitting in droves. I’m beginning to think the reality is mostly a boring return to pre-pandemic normalcy, though, given how hard these articles are teaching for something noteworthy to share."</p>

They look and have geometry similar to a road bike, but they have enough clearance for nice fat gravel tires.I ride in Chicago (shitty roads, potholes &amp; construction are everywhere), and love that I can put nice 38mm+ GravelKing Slick tires on the bike, and still have no problem keeping up with most road bikes. I&#39;ve gotten funny looks from folks who&#39;re unfamiliar with the concept, but it&#39;s such a great setup.Comfy/soft ride too.Edit: Cannondale Topstone if anyone is curious."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I think folks might be interested to consider some of the other myths and tests in the series, such as:* Titanium is ligther than steel* Fenders slow you down* Stiffer frames are faster* Disc brakes work better than rim brakes* Higher tire pressure is faster* Bigger wheels roll fasterhttps://www.renehersecycles.com/category/myths-in-cycling/For more nuanced tire testing and results, check out these two more recent articles* https://www.renehersecycles.com/how-we-test-tires/* https://www.renehersecycles.com/bq-tire-test-results/"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Narrower tires, necessarily inflated to a high pressure, are actually inefficient on a bumpy surface.A tire&#39;s job is to absorb surface defects in the road, and that is not only for comfort, but rolling efficiency.The extreme example of this occurs off-road. Off-road vehicles benefit from wider tires that are inflated to a lower pressure. If you have an off-road vehicle, it behooves you to take some of the air out of the tires when you go off-road.25mm road bike tires basically require a polished velodrome; real roads consist of pitted, eroded and cracked asphalt.If your bike is vibrating from the crappy road, you&#39;re probably not going as fast as you could be. Letting some of the air out for a more efficient, smoother ride is risky, if the tires a narrow; you risk snakebite flats and damage to the rim.For commuting in run-down city with aging infrastructure, you want at at least 38 mm tires. 40 mm is a nice round number. You can vary the pressure for the kinds of roads you&#39;re riding on with a lot of margin, and can take it quite low for dirt roads.I&#39;ve commuted around town with pressures as low as 45 psi in the back, 35 in the front, in 45 mm tires.I have story in relation to that. One time I was riding along NW Marine Drive in Vancouver, from UBC down to Spanish Banks. I came down from the hill and then along the flats there were some Spandex-clad road cyclists ahead of me. I pulled up to them and we were neck and neck. There was road work going on up ahead and the pavement had been scraped, leaving it horribly bumpy. I stood on the pedals and just cranked right through it, hardly slowing down. I saw in the mirror mounted on my eyeglasses that road bike guys dropped off as if a sniper had taken them out.What is the use of narrow tires? It&#39;s just fashion, like stiletto heels."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I think it&#39;s easy to forget we&#39;re not the same people we were 20-25 years ago. I see all sorts of lamentations about various things in the world changing and becoming less magical. But as far as I&#39;m aware, I could still go and argue about bands in chatrooms. I could talk to other writers and dream about my future best-selling novels. I could go read random opinions about any subject and get into an exhilarating flamewar about it.I don&#39;t want to do any of those things. I&#39;m in my 40s and I have 3 kids. The internet 15-year-old me experienced was magical because _I_ was a blank slate. Every new friendship was thrilling, every new skill opened up infinite horizons, every nook and cranny felt like somewhere I could belong. But life moves on. I&#39;m more than half-way through my career, perhaps not the one I was expecting. I didn&#39;t marry the girl I met on IRC. I don&#39;t have strong opinions about Radiohead anymore. I find people, however delightful and kooky they are, quite tiring having got to know 10,000 of them at this point.I know all this is true because my kids love the internet and find their place in it with all the joy I used to. And I&#39;m pretty sure older generations frowning upon it all is part of the rush anyway."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"From my perspective, I was in SWE at Apple for over a decade, their documentation started going downhill as iOS development ramped up. By the time they got to the yearly release cycle for macOS and iOS documentation was an afterthought. Most was generated with doxygen from inline docstrings.The reason I think the quality and quantity dropped was the internal schedules barely (or don&#39;t) leave enough time for the engineering work so there&#39;s very little time available for high level documentation. Internally tons of &#34;documentation&#34; existed as Radar comments or exchanges on internal mailing lists. Maybe a group&#39;s wiki had some crystallized documentation or high level architectural descriptions but good luck accessing it from outside that org. My favorite was some discussion about overall design or architecture that got the &#34;let&#39;s take this offline&#34; where all the helpful details ended up shared in an in-person meeting.The internal secrecy and rapid development pace made it really difficult to get good overviews of technologies internally. I really sympathize with outside developers trying to cobble together an understanding of something where the documentation sucks or is missing.The DocC tooling isn&#39;t going to be anymore effective than doxygen or other auto generated documentation without good architectural documentation. A function definition is nice but knowing you need to decombulate a frobnob before snizzlizing or that decombulation can only safely be done on the main thread is often more important. I can read a function signature but I can&#39;t necessarily know all the keys that go into some configuration NSDict passed into it.I hope the situation improves if the DocC tooling lowers the friction for writing documentation. It sucks having to mix a WWDC presentation, sample code, and iffy docs into a semblance of usable architectural documentation."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This speaks to me. I’m not deeply involved in the iOS development world but I do a lot of webview-adjacent stuff so I keep a close eye on the WKWebView documentation.It’s a mess. Case in point: introduced in the new beta: loadSimulatedRequest:https://developer.apple.com/documentation/webkit/wkwebview/3...What does it do? Don’t know. I can make a few informed guesses from the name but I’m not sure if it’s maybe a performance measurement tool, or just a way of loading faked data. There is no documentation. To the best of my knowledge it isn’t covered in any talks either."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Isn&#39;t the real time most software documentation started going down hill was as the internet became the primary way of distributing and updating software?When software distribution was tied to hardware mediums, it froze snapshots in time, and the documentation thereof could be snapshotted with it (to varying levels of success). Even needed to be.But once it all became primarily net based, it meant the software was always fluid, in motion. Imagine the tech writer approaching a developer now days:&#34;Explain how this works to me&#34;&#34;Ok, right now, it works like this, but we&#39;re working on a revised version for next year...&#34;&#34;Sigh. Ok, explain that to me too.&#34;&#34;You bet, but make sure and check back with me before you publish, because some things might change yet.&#34;It&#39;s an irony, that the original dream of &#34;the web&#34;, a distributed documentation system, is rendered ever instantly out dated in the realm of software because of the distribution models it eventually enabled. Unintended side effects I guess.As a side anecdote, consider man pages for venerable established Unix commands. Now consider the man pages for newer Unix utilities. IME, the newer features are often under documented and require going to code portals to get detailed/up to date answers."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Rust has an interesting, and somewhat difficult, memory model.First, there&#39;s the single ownership tree. Single ownership is checked by the borrow checker. You can have only one mutable reference to a data object at a time, and that&#39;s also checked by the borrow checker. If you can stay within that model, if the program compiles, it will probably work at the data access level.But then there are all the escape hatches.There&#39;s &#34;Rc&#34;, which is reference counting for read-only use. This works fine for immutable objects, but not for mutable ones.There&#39;s &#34;Cell&#34; and &#34;RefCell&#34;. These allow multiple ownership, and only one mutable access at a time. Request mutable access via two routes and you get a panic, or an error if you use try_borrow();
The static analysis of the borrow checker is not able to figure out when you&#39;re headed for trouble via this route.There&#39;s &#34;Arc&#34; and &#34;Mutex&#34;, which allows access across thread boundaries. Request access via two routes in the same thread, and you deadlock.Designing the data structures for something tightly coupled with concurrency, like a window manager or a game, is difficult."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Wow, I&#39;m surprised I never ran across this excellent essay before.I also liked the use of the term &#34;memory model&#34; in this case to mean conceptual model, because the metaphors and affordances of a language are what give (or restrict) its expressive power and the level of abstraction you can bring to bear.  A mixed blessing."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&#34;Memory model&#34; has yet a third meaning, referring to interference between operations in multiple CPU cores, and mediated by variously-shared parts of cache systems of varying complexity.Here, complexity of the memory model is traded off against complexity of the primitives to manage the interference, (compare-and-set, load-locked/store conditional, etc.) and with the complexity of the cache system.Java&#39;s original memory model, perhaps the first formally specified, turned out to be unimplementable on common actual machines. The next language to get a formal memory model was C++, followed shortly by C and then others.Real multicore machines have sorted themselves out into two models of cache coherency; one more forgiving represented by mainstream x86 and now Apple M1, relying on deeply complex cache designs, and the other by the remaining lottery survivors, non-Apple ARM, and Power. The various RISC-V implementations will probably straddle the divide, like ARM/ARM-M1.Java, C++, and C can with some discipine be coded to work transparently on either, but very often programs accidentally depend on the x86/Apple model, never having been tested beyond it. Rust, absent &#34;unsafe&#34;, is happy on either. The Linux kernel works on either, and once supported other more exotic variations."</p>

[2], so it&#39;s a bit surprising that it is presented in this BBC article as something &#34;miraculous&#34; and new.What&#39;s curious to me is that the information presented in the BBC articles is slightly different from what has been reported here in Singapore. The BBC articles say that the wolbachia infection is passed on. Our reporting has been that male mosquitos infected with wolbachia that mate with females will not produce viable eggs, but otherwise, infected females will pass the wolbachia infection on. I wonder what the details are.[0] https://www.nea.gov.sg/corporate-functions/resources/researc...[1] https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/wolbachia-mos...[2] https://www.bbc.com/news/health-50487724"</p>

What more are you looking for?Apart from “not have the bug in the first place” -- and I hope and expect they’ll go into more detail later when they’ve had time for a proper post mortem -- I’d be interested to hear what anyone thinks they could have done better in terms of their immediate firefighting."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"What else should scientists do than challenging the status quo?Bret (Eric&#39;s brother, biology PhD) had a 2h long conversation with Pierre Kory (MD) and it was taken down by YT. One of the things they talked was the recommendations of WHO and other organisations to focus on supportive care only (supporting the patient while their organism fights the disease by itself). They insist on not using other treatments outside clinical trials. The argument that running experiments would cost lives doesn&#39;t seem coherent. It&#39;s not like we have this 100+ yrs practice of dealing with SARS-CoV-2 epidemic with well established protocols. What if we&#39;re clinging to a suboptimal strategy?"</p>

When Youtube mistreats me, where am I supposed to go? BitChute? Vimeo? Neither of those have even half the creators as Youtube. And if creators want to migrate off Youtube, how are they supposed to do that when they&#39;ll get less than 10% of the audience on the other sites? Youtube&#39;s moat way is too deep to be threatened by any competition no matter how technically advanced the competition is.Youtube is a monopoly and needs to be regulated as such. The electric company can&#39;t cut off my power because I was using their electricity to discuss experimental medications, so why should Youtube be allowed to deny me access to the online public square for the same reason? If Youtube wants to be the thought police of their users, they need to first allow an alternative to survive."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"You really don&#39;t need anything fancy to implement a queue using SQL. You need a table with a primary id and a &#34;status&#34; field. An &#34;expired&#34; field can be used instead of the &#34;status&#34;. We used the latter because it allows easy retries.1. SELECT item_id WHERE expire = 0. If this is empty, no items are available.2. UPDATE SET expire = some_future_time WHERE item_id = $selected_item_id AND expire = 0. Then check whether UPDATE affected any rows. If it did, item_id is yours. If not, loop. If the database has a sane optimizer it&#39;ll note at most one document needs locking as the primary id is given.All this needs is a very weak property: document level atomic UPDATE which can return whether it changed anything. (How weak? MongoDB could do that in 2009.)Source code at https://git.drupalcode.org/project/drupal/-/blob/9.2.x/core/... (We cooked this up for Drupal in 2009 but I am reasonably sure we didn&#39;t invent anything new.)Of course, this is not the fastest job queue there is but it is quite often good enough."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Redis to me is the magic solution to solve so many complex multiple process syncing issues, a global lock, rate limiter, uniqueness with a set, stasher of all the temporary things… no migration, quick solution to complex problems- streams of events to organize pending tasks, etc… to me it’s all about the temporal / temporary state my application needs to keep track in order to work in a multiuser - multiprocess and multi service environment… just a different tool for a different job then what I would use a database for… but really it’s computer science, to each is their own"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I think one of the biggest advantages of using Redis for job queing vs Postgres comes down to library support.For example Python has Celery and Ruby has Sidekiq. As far as I know there&#39;s no libraries in either language that has something as battle hardened with comparable features for background tasks using Postgres as a backend.There&#39;s a big difference between getting something to work in a demo (achievable by skimming PG&#39;s docs and rolling your own job queue) vs using something that has tens of thousands of hours of dev time and tons of real world usage.I&#39;m all for using PG for things like full text search when I can because it drastically reduces operation complexity if you can avoid needing to run Elasticsearch, but Redis on the other hand is a swiss army knife of awesome. It&#39;s often used for caching or as a session back-end so you probably have it as part of your stack already. It&#39;s also really easy to run, uses almost no resources and is in the same tier as nginx in terms of how crazy efficient it is and how reliable it is. I don&#39;t see not using Redis for a job queue as that big of a win."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"If you happen to have a VR headset and are looking to play around with the toys described in the article, I recommend VTOL VR. It has pretty low system requirements, and takes advantage of VR to create a virtual hotas (It is much more effective than you would expect). The physics simulation is, to my understanding, very good. And everything described in this article is present in the game to be played around with.VTOL VR taught me about &#34;Radar Notching&#34;. The article briefly mentions how radar can actively detect the doppler shift of targets. If you think about it, the doppler shift of the ground would be neutral, right? Or roughly the speed of the aircraft. So lets say you&#39;ve been locked on by a fighter at high altitude and they&#39;ve fired a radar seeker at you. Your backdrop is the ground, it can pick you out because you&#39;re moving so fast. So what you do is bank your aircraft to fly at a 90 degree angle to the oncoming missile. Now your doppler shift is the same as the ground and you blend in, the radar filters out the ground because of it&#39;s expected speed, which is now the relative speed you are moving. You get &#34;notched out&#34;, and the missile will lose track."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Becoming more religious has helped me identify religious tendencies in the secular world. Ideology doesn’t imply supernatural deities, and some worldly phenomenon can be elevated to a supernatural level.  Secular belief contains rituals, origin stories, deities, saints, priesthood, blasphemy, vice &amp; virtue just as religion does.One aspect of religion I appreciate is that these aspects are well codified and debated – i.e. much more explicit.In the secular world these aspects exist but they are implicit, making them difficult to debate and attack.Few people understand that most religions e.g. Judaism and Christianity have an apologetic discipline – a deliberate arm open to debate.The secular world would benefit from adopting more formal definitions of their belief system. I think that would reduce the conflict and neurosis that comes from engaging a nebulous system.If you believe you are not religious, it just means that you don’t have the cognitive tools to recognize the secular ideology that you have adopted."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I want to point out that this is incorrect:&gt; It’s rare to hear someone accused of being un-Swedish or un-British—but un-American is a common slur, slung by both left and right against the other. Being called un-American is like being called “un-Christian” or “un-Islamic,” a charge akin to heresy.In fact to be unswedish is not just a common idiom it’s a positive one. It’s when you don’t show the typical negative Swedishness. You aren’t “accused” of it, you are congratulated.“-I went to say hello to all the neighbors in my building. -What a nice and unswedish thing to do!”"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I think the real issue is laid out at the end&gt;&#34;If matters of good and evil are not to be resolved by an omniscient God in the future, then Americans will judge and render punishment now. We are a nation of believers. If only Americans could begin believing in politics less fervently, realizing instead that life is elsewhere. But this would come at a cost—because to believe in politics also means believing we can, and probably should, be better&#34;I think the author is part of a group of largely public intellectuals in the US who have subscribed to the theory of &#34;religion is the opium of the people, but that&#39;s a good thing&#34;.Yes, the loss of religion does away with a glue that in some sense kept a sort of false peace intact. Injustices can no longer be explained away with metaphysical explanations, superficial alliances under the banner of faith cannot be maintained. The people who stand to lose from this are the kind of people who write these op-eds. People who benefit from delaying conflict. The people who stand to benefit from the loss of religion are the people who need some justice in this world, not in the next one."</p>

Neither has ever had a job that lasted more than a month or so. Neither ever learned to drive even though they live in a town with little or no public transit. They haven&#39;t had any education beyond high school. They seem wholly unprepared to navigate life without their parents. It&#39;s a slow motion tragedy."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"What are the things that motivates them, and what do they themselves want to do in life?I ask this because much of the undertone in the article and in this thread is about the failure of meeting the gender role expectations that are put on young men. Do they have a job and a car? Have they studied hard so they can get a good job in order to support a wife and kid?Culture in the last several decades have hammered down on the negative aspects of stereotyping. A person who is 35 has gone through a life time of TV, movie and politics that on repeat has talked about the negative of gender roles for women, while the expectations on men has remained fairly unchanged. I do not find it strange at all if an increasing portion of men under this culture has rejected the role put on them.Which goes back to the original question I started with. What motivates them and what do they want to do with their life? If we want to avoid the slow motion tragedy, maybe the way forward is to help them answer those question in the absent of imposed gender roles."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This article suggests that you should not play too aggressive and not take continents too early (maximizing Reinforcing Feedback), because other players will then unite against you (Balancing Feedback).However, this article fails to understand that in Risk, most players are not willing to unite. In fact, if player A and player B decide to unite against me and player A had his turn and stopped me, player B is highly likely to backstab player A and then emerge as the winner.I&#39;ve found that playing very aggressively, and really get as many continents as possible within the first few turns, is the best way to win the game. I always win if I can get 2-3 continents in the first few turns, and if I fail then the game is usually won by whomever did manage to do just that.Being a turtle or &#34;mongolian horde&#34; as we call it can be interesting, but your only viable strategy is to wait for an opening while everyone else stockpiles their continental forces. If you wait too long, you&#39;re just an annoyance to the other players, but you don&#39;t actually have a good chance to win."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"In our gaming group, we decided Risk just isn&#39;t that good of a game. It&#39;s old and clunky and extremely long, there are 100 other better board games now. Our main plays have been Dominion, DnD, Gloomhaven, Wingspan, and Crokinole, all of which we greatly prefer."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"What a clickbait article. I’m really disappointed. The premise is interesting: win every time using a  new strategy. Then, discussion about the concept and preview of the “systems thinking” mentality. Not too bad (although the bathtub example was a pretty weak way to advocate for systems thinking, maybe that’s just me but it seems even in that example to be an overly reductive and not terribly insightful method of thought, but it was enough to entertain the next section). However, during the discussion of the strategy everything falls apart. “Let the other players fight each other. Win the game every time by not participating and hoping to inconspicuously amass an incredible army such that you can take over half the board and then turn the tide in your favor in one fell swoop.” If this fails the suggestion is then to play the meta game and beg for pity. Not a single piece of data to back up the claim that this strategy wins every time. In my experience it doesn’t. It also happens to be the strategy that most every player headquartered around Russia-Asia ends up playing because you simply cant control that part of the board early on. No “systems thinking required”. The author also claims hoarding cards is “safe” and wont trigger other players to consider you a threat to the balance of the system. Well, that’s just naive either on part of the author or requires other players to be pretty green to not account for the risk card factor. In reality, another player also using systems thinking would immediately identify you as a threat because they would be tracking unit quantity flow in and out for the players on the board and using that to inform their understanding of what constitutes a threat. I think that’s the disappointment kinda summed up: this strategy doesn&#39;t work in a game where everyone uses it because it depends on your opponents not paying attention rather than you making strategic moves to win the game. The author does not sufficiently incorporate all the complexities of the game and people to yield a solved game."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; Faculty members at prestigious universities are 50 times more likely than the average person to have a parent with a Ph.D. American meritocracy has become a complex, inefficient, and rigged system conferring its graces on ambitious children of highly educated and prosperous families.What’s the ratio in other fields of top achievement for kids to follow in their parents’ footsteps? It’s entirely unsurprising that academics raise academics, doctors doctors, Olympians Olympians, teachers teachers, etc.It’s equally unsurprising that the ambitious children of highly educated and prosperous families themselves pursue such a similar path and achieve similar outcomes. I’m an engineer and my spouse a scientist. Our kids have commensurately higher chance to pursue one of those or a closely related field due to exposure and biases."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Copyright 1991. This was probably making the rounds of homeschooling circles I hung out in.We tend to do a sucky job of teaching math to kids. A lot of elementary school teachers are women who were encouraged to go into early education because they weren&#39;t doing so well in math and this is very much gender bias.My ex husband wasn&#39;t good at math. No one told him he should spend his days teaching little kids because of it. He was a career soldier and he just got tutored in college (by me) for his math classes. He was just expected to work at it if it didn&#39;t come naturally and he did.So we just culturally pass around this idea that math is scary and little kids can&#39;t learn it rather than going &#34;Well, adults just need to up their game and, by god, explain it better.&#34;My oldest was math phobic by the time I pulled him out of school to homeschool. My one and only goal for math was to get him over his phobia.He loves physics. I hate calculus. Calculus makes sense to him and he has read calculus books for fun.I was good at explaining the math to him and he learned lots of solid math concepts even though he likely has dyscalculia and isn&#39;t good at crunching the numbers. But I got the concepts through to him and that&#39;s more important.He&#39;s what gets called &#34;calculator dependent&#34; in some circles."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;ve taught 7-year olds, rich kids specifically in technology magnet program.The pre-requisite information necessary for this would be way above their heads. Adding fractions, conceptualizing fractions to graphs, graphing functions... and that&#39;s just the first part!Most 7-year olds can barely conceptualize fractions. First/second grade math curriculums are centered around basic multiplication, shape recognition and counting.7-year olds aside, I don&#39;t even think most of the high-schooler freshmen I&#39;ve taught would be able to grasp this content."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I don&#39;t know how I feel about this.  I&#39;ve always been good at math, and was one of five kids (out of class of 120) that took Calculus as a senior in high school in the early 1990&#39;s.  To even take Calculus as a senior, you had to have taken four years of math in the previous three years.  I was even the HS Math Champion&#34; for my state.However, when I took Calculus in High School, it was taught similarly to this.  Lots and lots and lots of math foundations, infinite series, areas under curves, and I was able to trudge through it but I didn&#39;t really grasp what it all meant or why I was doing it.  Finally, about 2/3 of the way through the year, I was working on a problem and had an &#34;oh, shit, this is just about how things are changing&#34;.  It was a Eureka moment, and entirely based on such a simple statement that was never brought up in lectures or our crusty 1960&#39;s texbook."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Oil pipelines do one thing - transport oil. Not water, not milk, not corn syrup. Just oil.Rail can transport anything. Containers, tankers, even rocket booster segments.Yes, we&#39;re absolutely taking a short term hit, but investing in general purpose infrastructure that can be adapted for new technology and demands is a good thing. The continental rail network started off with coal powered steam trains, then diesel, now diesel-electric and even some pure electric locomotives. Maybe this century it will evolve past fossil fuels as well.So yes, cancel the pipeline, but in its place invest in the safety and reliability of rail networks."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"When I was learning to program, I tried to make a toy artificial life evolution simulation. Particle organisms on a 2D plane had &#39;dna&#39; which was a list of heritable traits, like size, speed, number of offspring.  Bigger organisms could eat smaller organisms, but they burn energy faster. 0 energy = death. When two organisms of opposite gender collided and had sufficient energy, they&#39;d give some of their energy split among the offspring, with each offspring&#39;s &#39;dna&#39; values set to one of the parent&#39;s +/- 5%.As I was developing this, I hadn&#39;t figured out how I wanted to do food yet, so as an easy first step, I just had a constant amount of energy that was split amongst all organisms on the screen.  Lots of little dots buzzing around, was kind of neat but nothing too special. I left it to run overnight.When I came back I was very surprised:  previously i was running at about 30FPS - now it was running at about 4 seconds per frame.  The screen was filled with dense expanding circles of tiny slow organisms emanating from where organisms had mated and nothing else.My simulation evolved to outsmart my simple food algorithm: when food is divided equally among all organisms, the best strategy is to use minimal energy and maximize offspring count.  I had populated the world with a default offspring count of ~5 and they had evolved to the tens of thousands. The more offspring an organism had, the greater the amount of the energy pool would go to their offspring.It was a very cool &#34;Life, uh, finds a way&#34; moment - that such a simple toy simulation of evolution was able to find an unanticipated optimal solution to the environment I created overnight was very humbling and gave me a lot of respect for the power of evolution."</p>

It is deterministic, internally consistent and vaguely resembles real chemistry. Tiny environments, simulated in the Autoverse and filled with populations of a simple, designed lifeform, Autobacterium lamberti, are maintained by a community of enthusiasts obsessed with getting A. lamberti to evolve, something the Autoverse chemistry seems to make extremely difficult.https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Permutation_City"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"If I loosely quote Louis Rossmann, one of the issue of right to repair is that more and more companies (Apple leading the trend) are using slightly modified chips from manufacturers, and them make then sign contracts that prevent any part selling to anyone.So technically even you can replace those chips, you can&#39;t buy them.And next Apple if putting serial numbers to prevent that even if you get the part, you will have a non-functional device.This bill does not appear to address that.Besides, the &#34;information they need to repair&#34; is also where the devil will be. Companies like Apple provide instructions on how to unscrew the laptop cover with a screwdriver (literally), but won&#39;t provide any data sheets."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Normally the next step would be a vote on an identical bill in the state’s Assembly.But Thursday is the last day of session for the NY legislature, and the bill has not yet escaped committee, making a vote by the full Assembly unlikely.The battle for fair repair in New York will continue into next year’s session, with a strong record of success.So eventually... maybe."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"From someone living in NY and having watched bills like this... Last time this came up it silently died without a vote. This vote is probably symbolic and it will languish in the Assembly forever. It is nice they voted for this overwhelmingly but it has not been &#34;passed&#34; as a law. It just passed step 1/3"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;d like to take this opportunity to share some relevant exercepts from In The Plex[^1] about Eric Schmidt, then-CEO of Google.&gt; One day Denise Griffin got a call from Eric Schmidt’s assistant. “There’s this information about Eric in the indexes,” she told Griffin. “And we want it out.” In Griffin’s recollection, it dealt with donor information from a political campaign, exactly the type of public information that Google dedicated itself to making accessible. Griffin explained that it wasn’t Google policy to take things like that out of the index just because people didn’t want it there. Principles always make sense until it’s personal,” she says.&gt; Then in July 2005, a CNET reporter used Schmidt as an example of how much personal information Google search could expose. Though she used only information that anyone would see if they typed Schmidt’s name into his company’s search box, Schmidt was so furious that he blackballed the news organization for a year.&gt; “My personal view is that private information that is really private, you should be able to delete from history,” Schmidt once said.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"In the mid-seventies at Swarthmore College, we were mired in punched card Fortran programming on a single IBM 1130. The horror, a machine less powerful than the first Apple II. My job six hours a week was to reboot after each crash. People waited hours for their turn to crash the machine. I let a line form once people had their printouts. I&#39;d find the single pair of brackets in a ten line listing, and I&#39;d explain how their index was out of bounds. They thought I was a genius. Late one Saturday night, I made a misguided visit to the computer center while high, smelled sweat and fear, and spun to leave. Too late, a woman&#39;s voice: &#34;Dave! I told Professor Pryor he needed you!&#34; We didn&#39;t know that Fred Pryor was the economics graduate student freed in the 1962 &#34;Bridge of Spies&#34; prisoner exchange. Later he’d learn that I was his beagle’s favorite human, and I’d dog-sit to find steaks for me I couldn’t afford, but for now I feared him. So busted! Then I heard this voice “See these square brackets? See where you initialize this index?” He was spectacularly grateful.One cannot overstate the rend in the universe that an APL terminal presented, catapulting me decades into the future. I quickly dreamed in APL. For $3 an hour for ten hours (a massive overcharge) I took a professor’s 300 line APL program translated literally from BASIC, and wrote a ten line APL program that was much faster. One line was classic APL, swapping + and * in an iterated matrix product for max and min. The other nine lines were input, output. The professor took years to realize I wasn’t also calling his code, then published my program.Summer of 1977 I worked as a commercial APL programmer. Normally one never hires college students for the summer and expects them to be productive. The New York-based vice president was taking the train every day to Philadelphia because the Philly office was so far underwater, and desperate to try anything to save himself the commute. He knew Swarthmore had a terminal, and heard about me. At my interview I made a home-run derby of the questions from the Philly boss. The VP kept trying to intervene so he could put me in my place before hiring me. The tough questions were “dead key problems”. How do you write the following program, if the following keys are broken?Our client was a mineral mining company, our task a reporting system. The reports were 2-dimensional projections of a 9-dimensional database. The accountants wanted all totals to be consistent across reports, and to be exactly the sums of their rounded components. I broke the news to our team that we needed to start over, rounding the 9-dimensional database once and for all, before generating each report. This took a few weeks; I wrote plenty of report generation helper routines. My coworkers overheard me say on a phone call that I was being paid $5 an hour, and at the time I didn’t understand which way they were shocked. I didn’t have much to do, the rest of the summer.The mining company VP found me one morning, to ask for a different report, a few pages. He sketched it for me. He found me a few hours later to update his spec. He loved the printout he saw, imagining it was a prototype. “It’s done. I can make your changes in half an hour.”At a later meeting he explained his own background in computing, how it had been key to his corporate rise. Their Fortran shop would take a month to even begin a project like I had knocked off in a morning, then weeks to finish it. He pleaded with me to pass on Harvard grad school and become his protege.Some Lisp programmers had similar experiences, back in the day. Today, APL just sounds like another exotic language. In its heyday it was radical."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Back in university (1974), I took a course in AI. The prof wanted us to write a brute-force solution to solve the 8-queens problem -- any language!I wrote the solution in APL in about an hour and it only had 3 lines of code. The rest of the class spent days on their terminals and keypunches trying to solve it. Most solutions took hundreds of lines of code.I got a D from my professor. I questioned why and was told that it was unreadable, and that the solution was inefficient. This annoyed me because he didn&#39;t know APL, and I figured that  since I solved the problem in one hour, while the rest took days, it was very efficient.I protested the result with the department head (who liked APL) and ended up getting an A+. As you can imagine, all the rest of my assignments, written in a variety of languages, were graded by that AI prof with significant prejudice.I passed nonetheless. I loved APL and ended up working for one of the major APL providers as my first job out of school."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I have a theory on why we&#39;re seeing so much &#34;bad management&#34; for software engineers: most leaders at workplaces have not been engineers themselves at a company with a great engineering culture (I wrote about what I think this means [1]: it&#39;s all the high-growth small and large tech companies we know)The CEO, and the people under the CEO know and understand traditional, top-down management. Let the people with context and decision power make the big decisions, and pass this downwards. Works with finance, works with marketing, works with IT support, and should work with engineering as well... right?But it actually doesn&#39;t work with software engineers as well as it could. Or with designers. UX researchers. PMs... all these people would produce a magnitude more output when given proper context and autonomy.A few leaders read about this, and try giving autonomy. These results end up even worse than the status quo, as you can&#39;t just make it a free-for-all and expect it works overnight.And to prove this point: look at companies where the founder had worked at a high-performing company before. Before founding Twilio, Jeff Lawson spent years at Amazon (he was one of the first AWS PMs), and in his book Ask Your Developer, he writes about just how much this experience shaped him, and all the practices he adopted from Amazon.There&#39;s this really weird divide between &#34;forward-looking tech companies&#34;[2] who &#34;get it&#34;, and everyone else. Which heavily benefits this first group.[1] https://blog.pragmaticengineer.com/the-developer-culture-tes...[2] https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=25717390"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; In most companies, management is actually to blame for deliberately isolating engineers from discovering the customer&#39;s needs. News flash! Developers actually like the idea of figuring out and fulfilling needs with epic software solutions and are fairly neutral-to-downright-annoyed at spending their time creating something that no customer wants.I agree with the first statement but disagree with the second. Yes, management is often at fault for not involving or engaging developers. That said, I&#39;ve seen many really solid developers be motivated by solving complex technical challenges instead of work that actually creates business/product value. Of course, it&#39;s management&#39;s responsibility to harness that energy and align it with creating value... But just saying, a lot of really smart people are driven more by intellectual challenges than product impact."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Developers have opportunities to improve management by increasing management-visible headlines about user goals, and decreasing management-visible headlines about implementation details such as UI, WBS, wireframes, flowcharts, and tech.Try this thought experiment: Imagine you have team task list with headlines such as &#34;Add red button to top of home page&#34;. Imagine rewriting the headlines such as &#34;Customer wants to contact us&#34; and similar kinds of user stories.When managers continually see headlines with user emphasis, and do not see headlines with implementation details, then management improves and developer autonomy improves, because both groups are looking toward users.It turns out focus on user stories can help significantly, even more than some developers might intuit. Look at your task board headlines and the opening paragraphs of your management-visible writing-- can you improve your writing to emphasize user goals?"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I disagree with so much of this! Though I can tell the author is coming from a lot of experience.How often is it that you don&#39;t know if you&#39;re expecting a map or a keyword list? I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve ever intentionally put myself in that situation (though it&#39;s nice that access supports both).They say to avoid piping result tuples, but I actually think their example code shows the strength and weaknesses of both approaches. I use pattern matching on tuples when you want more complicated behavior (that might be hard to read in a big else block for a with) and a nice with statement when there&#39;s &#39;one true path.&#39;In general, I think one of my favorite things about Elixir is that they&#39;ve done a good job of avoiding adding features you should never use. These all feel like personal judgements about tradeoffs rather than actual hard rules."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I love this article to bits. The elixir community loves blogging, but so much elixir content is absolute beginner stuff, and so much of the remainder is unopinionated, descriptive stuff. I&#39;ve found it really hard to strike on some good &#34;how to best do xyz, what are the tradeoffs&#34; style knowledge. This article is the first elixir thing I&#39;ve read in a long time that really made me go &#34;o wow yeah, I&#39;ve been doing that wrong&#34;. Cool stuff!"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Good stuff. I disagree about the first point, though, and have actually gone the opposite way, going from generic Access via `[]` to specific `Map.get` and `Keyword.get`.The reason is that the underlying data structures are quite different, and operations and access patterns on them shouldn&#39;t be agnostic.You should use Keywords basically only as options to functions, in my opinion, and that&#39;s just for historical consistency and interop with Erlang. Otherwise key-value pairs should be a map. And using `Keyword.get` and `Map.get` make it immediately obvious what the underlying data structure is, as well as prompt you to think about whether you should use the `!` version or provide defaults.Otherwise, I think the tips are all decent to great. I am a little on the fence with exceptions, though. I know there&#39;s a meme in the community of &#34;let it crash&#34;, but in my experience, that rarely feels like the right thing to do. I much prefer a Rust-style, &#34;Result-all-the-things&#34;. It seems hard, in practice, to rely on crashes and restarts to maintain the right state invariants."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"If you can afford a one off 1 second of latency for your SQL queries, then using logical replication with pgbouncer seems way easier :- setup logical replication between the old and the new server (limitations exist on what is replicated, read the docs)- PAUSE the pgbouncer (virtual) database. Your app will hang, but not disconnect from pgbouncer- Copy the sequences from the old to new server. Sequences are not replicated with logical replication- RESUME the pgbouncer virtual database.You&#39;re done. If everything is automated, your app will see a temporary increase of the SQL latency. But they will keep their TCP connections, so virtually no outage."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Braintree (IIRC) had a really clever migration strategy, although I can&#39;t seem to find the blog post now.  They paused all traffic at the load balancer, cut over to the new DB, and then resumed traffic.  No requests failed, just a slight bump in latency while the LBs were paused.This app apparently had robust enough retry mechanisms that they were able just eat the errors and not have customer issues—Color me impressed!  I&#39;m not sure how many teams can make that claim; that&#39;s a hard thing to nail down."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is one of the areas where Postgres is so far behind MySQL is embarrassing. Zero downtime migrations in MySQL have been a common method for over 10 years. This solution is far from ideal due to the use of Triggers which can greatly increase the load on the database and slow down transactions. If you don&#39;t have a lot of load on your DB thats fine, but if you are pushing your DB this will bring it down.In MySQL they started with triggers with PT-OSC, but now there is GH-OST which does it with Replication. You can do something like this with Postgres by using Logical replication, but its still requires hand holding, and to my knowledge there is no way to &#34;throttle&#34; the migration like you can with GH-OST. Where I work now we are building all this out so we can have first class online migrations, but the chasm is still pretty big."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"If this gets enough traction this could make historical maps so much more accessible. Instead of every historian writing their own magnum opus of a particular area and timespan, all the geographical information can be combined in a single system. Is there a system built in for keeping track of annotations/sources? How are debated topics/unresolved locations dealt with?What if different schools of thought exist for where something was in the past, could multiple hypothesized locations exist for a single object? Direct link with Wikipedia would also be usefulVery nice project, hope it becomes as useful and detailed as the present day OSM"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Being Dutch and a history-buff, I have one mayor gripe with historical maps, that sees land as &#39;moving lines&#39; on a fixed map. When I look at a historical maps (also in books), I often see the Netherlands represented in it&#39;s current form, i.e. containing land that is not even 50 years old, being prestent hundreds or even thousands of years. I get that it is an intricate history, and maybe too much effort in some cases, but please at least remove flevoland. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flevoland"</p>

Require app developers to submit a template string (and not &#34;\(message)&#34;) for each notification the app can deliver for approval in the App Store and let me have an on/off switch for each one.&#34;Notifications&#34; across every platform drive me crazy, because they usually start out as useful, but because people tend to pay them more attention than all the other channels that have already been tuned out, companies start juicing them for engagement.

								<p class="story__comment_others">"The article wants Apple to save us from mindless browsing, but I see mindless browsing as unavoidable. Not because of some technical or legal thing, but because mindless browsing is a good thing. We need it. Mindless browsing is like a walk through the woods, just looking for what is happening, navigating a huge amount of information that is hardly important at the moment – oh, the cherry tree is blooming – but could be important later.The &#39;outside&#39; is made up of myriads of tiny details – wind is moving the leaves, slowly and irregularly, the birds are singing, insects flying through the air, the earth feels soft and damp and smells of freshness after the rain, the movements of clouds and the sun are inexorably changing the lighting. We are, however, spending time in concrete boxes where nothing ever moves, and even seal off the sounds and air flow from the outside. Within those boxes we sit and lie and enter other, flatter spaces of our screens, which nonetheless offer us the possibility of some kind of change, movement in the world.. Of course we will browse those changes mindlessly.Since mainstream social media has turned into a manipulative toxic landscape, I find myself retreating to more niche and better moderated sites, devoid of hate and over-strained emotions. I also find myself wishing for a digital space, be it a game or a website, that would feel similar to a walk in the woods – where a lot is happening but not much is important. Like watching the breaking of waves on the beach. Like sitting at a campfire. Like watching the tree tops move in the wind.I like mindless browsing. I enjoy it. Just give me the right space for it."</p>

I mean when I first got my 286 the machine was just full of possibilities. I think learning the ins and outs of it was more fun than doing anything productive.I used to hack away at it all day and night. Learning about interrupts, tinkering with the BIOS settings, hacking the serial port, irq, etc. Now everything is just locked down. In my latest phone I can&#39;t even run `fastboot` as that too has been locked down permanently because &#34;security&#34;.Thank god we have Linux created before all this Bullshit started happening. If Apple, Google and Microsoft was in charge of things as they are now, we wouldn&#39;t even have any hardware to run anything else than Windows and iOS."</p>

(There is one catch: to avail yourself of this, you must collect tax for all SST states, even though you might be below the threshold in some of them).The companies participating are Avalara, TaxCloud, Sovos, and Accurate Tax.For small online businesses I suspect that a lot more can take advantage of this than you might expect.

Although it is missing some big states that you probably do a lot of business in (California for instance), a lot of those big states have quite high thresholds for sales or number of transactions before tax kicks in.Some of the companies that provide the fee SST service will also add non-SST states for a fee. If you only need one or two non-SST states, it will still probably come out cheaper than using Stripe (and will include reporting and filing).[1] https://www.streamlinedsalestax.org/"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I was lucky to be part of the beta for my SaaS (https://turnshift.app) and I must say this new feature simplifies things A LOT.Especially as a EU business owner, I previously had to sync every VAT tax rate possible, use a complex workflow to know if a customer needed to pay taxes or not, link tax rates to customers, and create taxes reports for my accountant. Stripe tax does all of that automatically, based on the customer full address and VAT numbers.Here&#39;s a twitter thread of everything you had to do previously: https://twitter.com/vvoyer/status/1347488977738149888PS: Yes there were other services (Paddle) providing this (and much more to be honest), but the Stripe API and customization options makes it my go-to solution for integrating payments."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Honest question: can somebody enlighten me about Stripe&#39;s appeal? I am not an user (until recently they weren&#39;t even available in my country) but I used ShareIt (now Digital River) 20 years ago and Avangate (now 2checkout soon Verifone) in the past 15 years and they both:- had a much larger international presence, with localizations and everything- had sales taxes, VATs etc computed from day one- had cart (not sure about ShareIt though) &amp; API- integrated countless payment gateways: from credit cards to purchase orders, wire transfers and even PayPalHow comes Stripe won even if they arrived much later on the market? I believe their pricing structure was not very far from the competition. What did they offer to attract users even though they lacked such important features?I want to learn."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"A few years back, I had the opportunity to lead the Product Team of a 200+ people company. It took me over a month to understood who does what, and I tend to try to know things around me and at least have the idea of “what to do in an emergency.”I stumble on one DevOps guy who wrote every bloody thing happening in the system. He likes doing it, but from the way people were asking questions in the common chatrooms, group emails, I knew nobody read them. He loves plain text, nicely formatted with the old-school Unix-styles et al. I had talks with him outside of work and found him fascinating; I asked him help with my hobby, home-lab tinkerings, etc.By that time, I had already started internal blog groups and was encouraging people to write. And indeed, a lot of people came out to write about engineering, marketing, product, and it became a routine for people to show off what they can do, what they love, and what they are good at.In one of my regular company-wide emailers, I dedicated a big piece to the DevOps guy, pointing to his work and the beauty of his documentations. People loved it, and they began reading it. He remained a friend. That mailer was the only way I could highlight people I encounter doing good work, to the whole team up to the CxOs.By the time I left the company, I was responsible for many vital things in the company, but I could transition everything smoothly with the documents and credential details (thanks to 1Password).In the last year or so, I have been thinking more about -- always be dying. I think the similar vein of Always be Quitting; I try to document, write out details, just in case I die and my family has to figure out the intricacies."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"What does one do when they live by this philosophy of documenting everything and making sure knowledge is captured, but your team mates just refuse to volley the ball back? I find myself documenting how the software works, writing up proposals with beautiful diagrams etc, but my teammates won&#39;t take the simple step to even read the dang thing without scheduling a meeting with me to spoon feed / read it aloud to them."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Paradoxically, by being disposable, you free yourself.No, you just make yourself disposable.War is peace.
Freedom is slavery.
Ignorance is strength.Don’t listen to this article. It sounds like something overseers would tell their underlings.And when you’re quitting, that’s the company’s problem, not yours."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"There are a range of anti-vaccine opinions from idiotic (the example Linus quotes) to more reasonable. The way this issue has been handled is emblematic of the way many such political issues are handled: fringe views are promoted and &#34;debunked&#34; while more reasonable views that go against mainstream narratives are ignored. This is amplified by various high profile personalities in the media who shape the views people are presented with, so that all critics of the mainstream narrative appear to be lunatics. Thus stigmatizing anyone who has a more reasonable objection. This is not a new phenomenon but has played out much more frequently over the last year or so.Also, I got the vaccine, so if you interpret this as some sort of veiled anti-vaccine comment you are part of the problem."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"One of the interesting things that happened at my company is that productivity instantly doubled when we started working remotely. The reality at my company is that people are only getting 20 hours or so of work done in the office - the rest is socialization, pointless meetings, lunches, or trying to look busy. When we went home for lockdown and kept working 40 hour weeks, not only did productive output double, but everyone burned out in a few weeks.In my opinion, the reality of working from home is that 20-30 hour work weeks need to be acceptable and we should use the rest of our time on non-working things, just like we did in the office, but now that time can be more meaningful to us."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"So yes, as a &#34;boss&#34;, the work-from-home future is definitely and absolutely destroying my brain, but I think the whole discussion around control in the article completely misses my point. I couldn&#39;t care less about control and never cared about seat-in-the-ass time before.But as an engineer become manager, I can absolutely feel both sides here:While everything development is massively more chill remote (no interruptions and hey, just go fill your dishwasher while stuff compiles), everything about managing remotely completely sucks for me.Videocalls. Whiteboarding. Interviewing. Strategic work. Reading emotions and connecting to people. What was a matter of just getting six people in a war room for a week and getting that hard problem done now takes eternities and every meeting is an energy hog.Honestly, I really enjoyed being a leader for a technology organization, but right now, I absolutely hate it. There seem to be others who cope better, but it&#39;s certainly not for me.I&#39;m pretty curious on how all of this will turn out."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; Now, someone insufferable will read this and say “NOT ALL MIDDLE MANAGERS,” and let me tell you, if you’re thinking that, you are probably part of the problem.Clever.  Take the obvious objection--that this is all based on stereotyping of the role and, frankly, cynical assumptions about the way management is or can be structured--and then just turn it into another symptom of management dysfunction!How very tautological: Before you tell me I&#39;m wrong, let me tell you you&#39;re wrong for telling me I&#39;m wrong.And yes, I&#39;m a manager.  And no, I never spent time &#39;[walking] the floors, “[keeping] an eye on people” and, in meetings, “[speaking] for the group.”&#39;&#39; because I have far far more important things to do, like helping my staff understand the corporate vision so they can make good, independent decisions; helping solve problems for my staff when they come to me with issues; working with our sales team to manage customer expectations and negotiate on projects and solutions; managing the expectations of senior management based on the information I&#39;m getting from my staff.  And the list goes on and on.But, who am I to say.  I&#39;m just a middle manager who is, I&#39;m sure, just part of the problem..."</p>

It specifies a granularity of points are allowed to be endpoints of a validity period, but these are still POINTS AFAICT.&gt; It means that, for example 10:00:01 is AFTER 10:00, even though 10:00:01 is not a valid endpoint of a validity period (and it doesn&#39;t have to be, as it is a measurement result, not a validity period endpoint).&gt; Does RFC or BR requires a browser to round down the measured current time to full seconds, before comparing them against the validity period?As a random member of the public, this seems like a reasonable interpretation to me... though the time format which expiry dates are required to be expressed in is explicitly not allowed to include fractional seconds... so maybe it is meant as an interval not a point in time."</p>

Apple built a platform, where they take some cut for themselves, while allowing other people to sell digital contents on their platform.Other than the argument that this could be an anti-trust situation (i.e. in that case, the argument would be that Apple is abusing their market position), what differentiates these two cases ?"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Being a hedgehog is useful on the journey to domain mastery because sticking to frameworks saves you time and headache compared to not having any frameworks at all.The 3 stages of domain mastery:Stage 1 - No knowledge or structure to approach a domain (everything is hard, pitfalls are everywhere)Stage 2 - Frameworks that are useful to approach the domain (Map to avoid pitfall areas)Stage 3 - Detailed understanding of the domain (in which you can move through pitfall areas freely and see where frameworks fall short)Hedgehogs are at stage 2. You move from stage 1 to stage 2 by adopting frameworks; hence, hedgehogs are seen as &#34;thought leaders&#34; because they teach the frameworks that lead MOST people to more mastery. Except when you&#39;re at stage 3, in which case frameworks lead you to more inefficiencies compared to your own understanding.All good decisions must be made by stage 3 persons, but ironically, training is most efficiently done by stage 2 persons. Hedgehogs get more limelight because 90% of the population is at stage 1 and values the knowledge of stage 2 (and can&#39;t grasp the complexities and nuances of stage 3).Many hedgehogs struggle to touch stage 3, and instead see stage 2 as mastery. This is compounded by the positive feedback loops of success - the frameworks save time, it gives them reputation, it allows them to save stage 1 persons from their ignorance, and it&#39;s the foundation of their current level and achievements. Frameworks are also convenient and broadly applicable to many problems; detailed domain mastery in contrast is difficult, time consuming, and  highly contextualized.All of this makes it hard to move beyond stage 2 into stage 3."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"It&#39;s cathartic to read other people who have to go through this.I&#39;m fighting red tape for my team as we build out a dashboard.Outlook is packed with 1–2 hour meetings for the next 3 months where so far I&#39;m:* being asked to load test our system to make sure it can handle the load (of 3 people?)* being asked to integrate with various analytics platforms so we can alert some poor schmuck at 3 AM in case the API goes down then (it&#39;s not a vital part of any platform)* told to have this run in k8s since everything runs in k8s* other pedantic tasks by Sys Ops who think everything is a nail and love to argue their points ad exhaustium (or worse, argue why their fav stack is the golden child)I understand the need for standards and making sure they&#39;re followed, but there really needs to be a human element of, &#34;is this truly needed for what I&#39;m trying to do?&#34;. So many engineering departments are all about automation, but don&#39;t truly think through how much automation is needed, rather than a 1 size fits all approach.I appreciate that this article comes to the conclusion that the more correct an answer will be, the more complicated it tends to be. I wish more people in decision making positions would understand this."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I enjoyed that read. I suspect that it probably pissed off a few folks.I&#39;m a grizzled, scarred old codger that spent most of his career, saying &#34;Are you sure that&#39;s a good idea?&#34;, only to be ignored, and then put in charge of mopping up the blood.I have learned that &#34;I told you so.&#34; is absolutely, 1000% worthless. It doesn&#39;t even feel good, saying it.What I have learned, is that, when I see someone dancing along a cliff edge, I quietly start figuring out where the mops are kept. If that person has any authority at all, I&#39;ll never be able to stop them from their calisthenics.One of my favorite quotes is one that pretty much describes &#34;hedgehogs&#34;:    &#34;There&#39;s always an easy solution to every human problem; Neat, plausible and wrong.&#34;

There&#39;s another one, by the same chap (H. L. Mencken):    &#34;The fact that I have no remedy for all the sorrows of the world is no reason for my accepting yours. It simply supports the strong probability that yours is a fake.&#34;

Of course, the issue is that for every 10,000 appalling, messy, featured-on-rotten-dot-com failures, there&#39;s one spectacular success. Since humans are biased to think of successful outcomes as more likely than they actually are, the ingredients for that success become a &#34;recipe,&#34; and are slavishly reproduced, without any critical thought, or flexibility.It&#39;s like a witch doctor&#39;s formula for headache cure is bat urine, dandruff from the shrunken head of a fallen warrior chief, eye of newt, boiled alligator snot, and ground willow bark. The willow bark is what did it, but the dandruff thing is the most eye-catching ingredient, so it gets the credit, and everytime the chief gets a hangover, they start a war.Somewhere down the road, a copycat substitutes hemlock for the willow bark, and headaches become a death sentence."</p>

Wow, uh, I definitely did not expect to be featured on HN this morning, but seeing this linked put a massive smile on my face.There are just so many examples of captivating writing, innovative problem solving, and candid discussion throughout the FFFs. Taken all together, the Factorio journey is one of my favorite _stories_ to read...and it contributed to becoming a better designer and engineer along the way. I really encourage people to read more of their blog than just what I&#39;ve linked, since it crosses so many areas of interest.To anyone reading that&#39;s worked on Factorio, thank you and you all are wonderful people."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Quick links to the five &#34;must read&#34; posts that William highlighted:&gt; FFF #243 - New GUI tileset: Showing off their GUI design document. A MUST READ, if only for a good example of a comprehensive design style that fits the game theme perfectly. (https://factorio.com/blog/post/fff-243)&gt; FFF #176 - Belts optimization for 0.15 : Incredible analysis of transport belts and optimizing their performance. A MUST READ. (https://factorio.com/blog/post/fff-176)&gt; FFF #204 - Another day, another optimisation : Solid technical writeup on how a prefetching optimization patch works across a number of resource-heavy factory builds. A MUST READ. (https://factorio.com/blog/post/fff-204)&gt; FFF #296 - All kinds of bugs : The snippet at the bottom is a perfect encapsulation of their attitude towards problem solving. It’s such a simple concept, just going a little farther, that can take tremendous discipline and focus. A MUST READ. (https://factorio.com/blog/post/fff-296)&gt; FFF #356 - Blueprint library for real : Michal “kovarex” Kovařík, one of the two cofounders, talks about falling out of the development process, losing his sense of purpose, and how playing Factorio with his son brought him back. Reading this one, even through the sometimes-broken English, is inspirational and a wonderful look at how things fall apart and come back together. Like I mentioned in the intro, this is one of those rare, special offerings that is technical in nature but deeply personal and human-centric in form. A MUST READ. (https://factorio.com/blog/post/fff-356)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;ve been a huge fan of Factorio since 2014.A huge fan of the game, the team, and the entrepreneurial adventure.Their willingness to share insights, every weeks, for 7 years is quite rare in the industry.It was also awesome to read the thought process behind each design decision alongside some nerdy story about C++ optimization.Factorio team, if you&#39;re ready this, thank you!"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Here&#39;s why investors buy up houses: they know your neighbors will do the dirty work of artificially constraining the housing supply, which makes it a good investment.Here&#39;s one who comes right out and explains this:&gt; Meanwhile, local opposition to building is so commonplace and the approval process so cumbersome, time consuming, and expensive, even when a proposed project complies entirely with requirements, approvals are not forthcoming, at least in an expeditious manner and needed supply is simply not provided.  Recently I heard of a new acronym to add to my vocabulary: CAVE, Citizens Against Virtually Everything, to be added to NIMBYISM and BANANA (Build Absolutely Nothing Anywhere Near Anyone).https://www.clearcapllc.com/2021/04/27/q1-2021-clear-capital...Support groups like https://yimbyaction.org/ if you want to &#39;stick it to the investors&#39;.

Although, I suppose this situation isn&#39;t unique.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&#34;Bitcoin is positioned to disrupt the remittances industry in El Salvador, estimated at about $5 billion annually. Most families in towns like El Zonte do not have bank accounts, and rely on services such as Western Union WU +0.5%, which take 5-10% in fees. The closest Western Union is approximately one hour by bus, requiring the recipient of the cash transfer to take the bus back with cash on hand, creating a safety issue.&#34; [0][0] https://www.forbes.com/sites/tatianakoffman/2020/07/14/this-..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Amazingly shortsighted. The primary beneficiaries of this will be organised crime, who will now be able to wash the Bitcoin via El Salvador to convert it to dollars, which they can use to buy trade items and export the profits.The number one export of El Salvador is actually people. If they were concerned about remittance fees they could just set up a bank in the US with low fees, instead of getting kickbacks from OCGs and Western Union / Money Gram etc.El Salvador is set to be a big climate change loser, and every joule spent on bitcoin is bringing them closer to disaster.&#34;El Salvador has seen a steady increase in extreme events (storms, floods and droughts) during the last 30 years. The Pacific coastline is already experiencing rising sea levels and it is expected that 10–28 percent of the country’s coastal zone territory will be lost by the end of the century. Coastal areas, home to over 30 percent of the population, are highly vulnerable to the combination of sea level rise and El Niño events.&#34;https://www.climatelinks.org/resources/climate-risk-profile-...Coastal flooding risk is significant due to loss of mangroves.https://thinkhazard.org/en/report/75-el-salvador/CF"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"To give some technical background: yes, using Lightning (as they seem to do) for affordable BTC payments is challenging for most. As far as I am aware that is why they rely on custodial solutions [1]. People hold their money with someone from their village they trust, which is not ideal but neither is being unbanked. Down the road I could easily see this trust being spread over multiple people using multisig wallets.The amazing thing about all this is that everyone can become a BTC &#34;bank&#34;. You need a bit of capital but orders of magnitude less than a normal bank would require, maybe 2k$ to get started of which you might spend 400$ on hardware and fees to open some channels. The trustless nature of lightning lets you and your users then join the global payment network without asking for permission from anyone and you can engage in commerce internationally.I think, while we are still early, that this is an awesome experiment. It will highlight the UX problems so we can fix them. Hopefully at some point all this will make sense to the average westerner too, so we can finally have a money not controlled by anyone (states, incumbent banks) again. But that might take a long time.[1] https://github.com/GaloyMoney/galoy#status-of-the-project"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Your problem is not with SMS as a second factor though. (Unless you think the attacker had your password as well). It is with the use of SMS as a single recovery factor.The very things that make SMS a uniquely good second factor make it an awful only factor. Use of SMS for account recovery should in general (or at least for important accounts) have a delay (order of days) that allows the real user to intervene."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I lost my Microsoft account years ago. I still get emails from Microsoft stating that there&#39;s suspicious activity on the account. I got two just yesterday.Despite that, despite still having access to the email the account is on, I cannot recover the Microsoft account. Despite Microsoft notifying me that the account is still, years later to this day, being abused, cannot use any form of recovery. I cannot access the account with help from support or even after visiting a brick-and-mortar store.It&#39;s one big reason that I&#39;ve long since refused to purchase anything more from Microsoft and have ditched Windows.Good luck recovering your stuff."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"As others have said, it is not that SMS 2FA is insecure; it is that thieves have figured out how to defeat it using SIM jacking and a bit of facebooking and googling.  It is now trivial to figure out your home town, your favorite pet, etc.  Also as others have said, the current alternatives have their problems.  What if you lose all your Yubi keys?  What if your phone was accidentally wiped and you never got around to backing it up?  You cannot prove you are you and so customer support cannot help you.  Google, Microsoft, and Apple are not known for helping consumers get themselves out of this catch-22.It is a mistake to ask consumers to protect, backup, and secure their digital lives themselves.  Consumers don&#39;t have the time or skills to keep up with the hackers.  If Apple, Google, ATT, Verizon etc. cannot provide digital security, this is an opportunity for someone else to step in.  My personal suggestion is this is a ripe opportunity for someone like the US Post Office or Department of Motor Vehicles.  Consumers would go to the US Post Office or DMV and purchase a Yubi key from them.  The additional value they add, is they can verify the identity of the consumers who is purchasing the Yubi key and replace the key if it is lost/stolen.  Similar to how they process driver licenses or passports.  This service is optional and would actually cost money.  I would gladly pay a monthly fee for this peace of mind."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I am really curious to see where we&#39;ll be in a year, two, three down the line wrt remote/office/hybrid work at major companies.This forced experiment has had some surprising outcomes about the effectiveness of remote workplaces, but working from home for only a year, in pandemic conditions, is clearly not the same as indefinitely in normal times. But there&#39;s reason to think that may go even better, not worse; I am really curious to see how it plays out and glad more companies are continuing to let people work remotely."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;ve been back in my company&#39;s office in person (medium-sized tech company) for the last week with a small subset of employees before we all go back, and I&#39;ve become pretty convinced that these hybrid models will not go well. Even while wearing masks and social distancing, I feel far more connected to the others that work in the office, and whether it&#39;s fair or not, personal connection and trust play a huge role in collaborating effectively and deciding who gets what work, who gets promoted, etc. If everyone can choose whatever combination of remote and in-person they want, it seems impossible to me that there won&#39;t be extremely strong in-group/out-group effects that will cause big organizational problems for companies. But I&#39;m saying this as a young person excited to work in person, so maybe others (parents, those with long commutes) feel it&#39;s still worth it."</p>

this year. And the interviewing process is so much faster today, companies are desperate, it takes me 2-3hrs of total effort to land a new job with thousands to chose from."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Vivaldi Mail? That took a while :-DVivaldi is developed by a team created by the former Opera founder and CEO. Vivaldi kind of tries to re-create the spirit of Opera, but I think it&#39;s going to be too hard to do it.For those who didn&#39;t use it, Opera was first a paid browser (which limited its reach), then an ad-supported browser (which again limited its reach). It then finally became a free browser but by then it was too late.It had its own, super fast, rendering engine (I forget its name, Presto?). It had a built in email client, feed reader, calendar (unfortunately with no Exchange or Gmail integration), a notes app, a powerful download manager and even a Bitorrent client. And a TON of features and UI flexibility.It was super compact, a marvel of engineering and UX design that managed to pack all those things in a package of about 5MB at the time, and you wouldn&#39;t even see or load the extra functionality like the email client if you didn&#39;t use it.Unfortunately with HTML5 and the Chrome-ification of the web, it couldn&#39;t keep up :-(Vivaldi tries to do the same on top of web techs and web techs just can&#39;t handle it. Web techs are almost as flexible but they&#39;re really slow and bulky.Still, I wish them luck."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I want to offer Vivaldi some praise, I switched to it as my main browser a few years ago, and it&#39;s been great. I had to look for a new browser when Firefox (that I had used since the Firebird days) kept breaking my settings and plugins with their updates. After yet another Firefox update I wasn&#39;t able to restore the browser to how I want it to be, so I tried Vivaldi.I&#39;m not even a big fan of the original Opera, but love Vivaldi&#39;s features such as easy screen splitting between two tabs and one-click actions to disable images or apply certain filters to a page. Picture-in-picture and pop-outs for media are also great, periodic tab reload is occasionally very useful.Ideally I&#39;d like to use a fully FOSS browser, but my patience with Firefox ran out, and Vivaldi is Chromium + custom open-source parts + closed-source UI layer. Good enough for me, though not ideal."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I switched to Vivaldi from Chrome earlier this year as I was uncomfortable with the level of Google integration in that browser.Vivaldi is based on Chromium and has lots of improvements over Chrome, like gestures out of the box, side panels, lots of clear options. And Chrome extensions work perfectly.
I&#39;ve had no issues so far.The complexity of managing a browser engine that does what everyone expects requires humongous resources so I can understand the move to Chromium. As long as the google bits are removed and the extensions work, it&#39;s great to have an alternative to Edge and Chrome.I mostly use Firefox as my daily browser and nothing would make me abandon it but it&#39;s nice to be able to segregate your various professional/private persona using different browsers."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"As I&#39;ve pointed out before, I think this problem didn&#39;t exist in 01974, or in CP/M at all, ever; I think CP/M was perfectly capable of creating files named AUX.H, or PRN.H, RDR.H, CON.H, LPR.H, etc.  IIRC, even CP/M PIP (which is what actually implemented the special device names) required the colon to indicate that you meant a device.  So if you wanted to print FOO.DOC on the printer in CP/M PIP you could say PRN: = FOO.DOC but not PRN = FOO.DOC.  You could also, I think, say B: = FOO.DOC to copy FOO.DOC onto drive B:.The problem was introduced, IIRC, in MS-DOS."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I knew what this was going to be as soon as I saw &#34;aux.h&#34; in the screenshot.Some years ago I was working on an embedded system that involved DisplayPort. For those unaware, DP&#39;s control channel is called AUX. One day, my new co-worker who used Windows asked me, who used Linux, why my AUX-related code wasn&#39;t checked in - which it most certainly was.And that, folks, is how I learned about this absurd property of Windows that exists to this day."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The thread inaccurately describes the limitation of these special names being on the &#34;OS level&#34; -- it&#39;s actually one layer down, in the DOS and Win32 subsystems. Windows NT doesn&#39;t throw fits about these file names if the subsystem you run under (see: POSIX, LXSS, OS/2) doesn&#39;t care about them. Cygwin can even override the Win32 behavior by just passing all its file handlers through the native NT API instead of the Win32 API."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The mob is a huge problem with Twitter (and adjacent social media), and the issue with a mob is purely that of its size. It&#39;s the size that makes the mob, and everyone who has ever considered chiming in to add their voice why so-and-so was bad should stop to think about whether the world really needs that additional voice. Each individual voice may be perfectly right. So-and-so may really have done wrong. But did they really do such wrong that the 10,000th voice is needed?I am ashamed to say I&#39;ve done it myself, back when I was on Twitter. My feed would start lighting up with some really Bad thing that so-and-so said -- and generally it was &#34;Bad&#34; -- and I&#39;d add my voice somewhere to that cacophony. Not necessarily writing to the Bad Person, but chiming in on someone&#39;s long thread.Now I look back and see I was another participant in the mob.Look, the author described in the post absolutely did herself no favors. Her book may have been great, but the way she interacted with people on social media was absolutely not. But being the 10,000th person to tell her that is never necessary. That&#39;s just wanting to join a mob, because mobs are fun, because you&#39;re all justified in this act together.Mobs are scary, because everyone thinks they are justified. A good friend of mine grew up in Kenya and recounted that when he was about nine, he saw a mob catch a thief. Joining in with everyone else, he took a wire and whipped the man. Next thing he knew, the crowd had put tires over the alleged thief and set him on fire. He has never forgotten the guilt he felt."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"It&#39;s not that the people who form a twitter mob don&#39;t think or &#34;let twitter think for them&#34;.It&#39;s that they actively enjoy hurting someone as a mob. They get a kick out of it, and it&#39;s not discouraged (as would be actually forming a mob out in the streets be). If anything, it&#39;s encouraging, and gives them not just the joy of kicking someone who is down, but also &#34;good person&#34; credits (because the one getting kicked is a bad person, of course).In other words, people are not mislead &#34;against their better nature&#34;: they are just encouraged to embrace their badness."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"There are so many comments here blaming Twitter while blissfully unaware that HN fuels the exact same online outrage. Almost every day there&#39;s a &#34;&lt;company&gt; did bad thing to me&#34; article on the front page and people immediately pick up their pitchforks and join the mob. You cannot fix the problem without acknowledging that we are all part of it."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Summary:1. Capital Gain taxes are delayed until you actually sell the stock.2. Corporate taxes are being reduced because companies are moving profits to foreign jurisdictions.3. Estate taxes &amp; income taxes are being avoided by the creation of charitable foundations.The 2nd and 3rd points are very valid, and I wish the author had spent more time on them.  Unfortunately instead, the author spends much more time on point 1, conflating wealth with income, and avoiding the obvious argument that capital gains are eventually taxed - the rich are not escaping that....unless point 3 (foundation) occurs.  And that should be the main story.Squabbling over a wealth tax is not useful.  The real issue is that the super rich create these personal &#34;foundations&#34; that act as never-taxed income holes, and then use them as personal and political tools.In total, there&#39;s nothing very revealing about this article.  It&#39;s everything we&#39;ve already known.  IMO, we need to curb foreign tax havens, and severely limit tax exemptions for charitable donations.A more interesting question is how did ProPublica get a copy of Jeff Bezos&#39; tax returns.  Seems like a leak at the IRS?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This article does not conflates income and wealth, stop saying that. This is NOT what it says. 
Thats&#39; the whole damn point, they say that the system &#34;tax the income&#34; is flawed because it allows to borrow as much as your wealth allows, and live your life exactly as if you had that in income, without ever paying the income tax.I am quoting &#34;Their wealth derives from the skyrocketing value of their assets, like stock and property. Those gains are not defined by U.S. laws as taxable income unless and until the billionaires sell&#34;"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Unless you are a wage or salary earner, it is trivially easy to avoid having to pay taxes, at least in the USA. Same with the much lauded “inheritance tax” and even, to a lesser extent, sales taxes. It costs about 4000us a year to maintain the legal structures required to pay essentially no taxes, except sales taxes in some locations.  In many cases, for lower levels of income, just having a small business can negate income tax burdens.Taxation always has been, and continues to be, a burden for the servile class to bear. The rich or enterprising pay taxes only when they are ill prepared or choose to, often to reduce scrutiny.The &#34; I should pay more taxes&#34; rhetoric from the wealthy is merely virtue signaling, it is totally legal to pay more taxes than you owe, and you can even reclaim the money later if you need to. There is nothing preventing anyone from paying the taxes that they feel that they should owe, in excess of legal requirements.By and large, sales taxes are more evenly applied, but that too is far from perfect."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"If we ignore all this culture war bullshit for a minute there&#39;s a really fascinating issue here.The concrete issue is flight search. When you google &#34;flight from a to b&#34;, rather then seeing search results linking to websites for flight search, the first thing you see is the results of Google&#39;s own flight search. Is that wrong? What about image search? When you search for &#34;skyline berlin&#34;, you&#39;ll see images of berlin&#39;s skyline, before you see links to other image search sites.Same is true for a lot other stuff. If you search &#34;timer&#34;, you&#39;ll see a timer, not links to various timers that look ugly as shit.As a consumer, I love it. So much easier.On the other hand, google could take over almost any business like this. At least, any business that is &#34;functional&#34; in the sense that the only thing you really want is to get some output based on your input.There&#39;s a clear tradeoff here between what&#39;s good for consumers, and concerns about democracy, the concentration of power, etc.. And also innovation. Why start a new company, if google can just take over everything?There are only two clear, non-arbitrary rules: Search engines are only allowed to show a list of links, or search engines can show whatever they want."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Terraform is such an underappreciated tool. It seems like so much of the hate surrounds HCL1 (back in Terraform before 0.12) and doesn&#39;t reflect modern Terraform.For example, after introducing `for_each` and dynamic blocks, it&#39;s possible to nearly entirely ditch variables files and local modules, and just add more infrastructure by editing a local YAML file. The only variables your Terraform code should have should be credentials / other secrets that are not loaded from environment variables by providers. A great public example of this usage pattern is supplied by https://github.com/concourse/governance to manage their GitHub repositories."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;ve been sitting on the fence wrt Terraform and other such tools for quite some time now. After being _forced_ to finally write massive k8s YAML files (and ansible YAML files) for a consulting gig, I&#39;ve been wondering whether these tools should be developed as _libraries_, that you glue together using a full-fledged programming language, instead of shoe-horning a programming language in YAML.For example, could the following be library functions that you could glue together in the programming language of your choice: (a) get current state of infra, (b) calculate diff between desired state and current state, (c) perform a single step (safely) that represents a granular change in infra, (d) perform a series of steps representing infra changes with safe rollback?Does something like this already exist?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Congrats to the talented people at Hashicorp.I love Terraform and have used it for years (before 0.12 I think). The workflow, meaningful diffs and reproducible &#39;infrastructure-as-code&#39; gave a user experience that really was a massive step up to what I was used to (basically cloud console and scripts in CI).In fact the Terraform workflow / philosophy inspired some of the design of an OSS &#39;data-as-code&#39; tool (https://www.getsynth.com/) that we&#39;re building a company around. We wanted to use HCL instead of JSON for our config to start off with, but the Rust HCL parsers when we started the project weren&#39;t really robust so we settled.Anyway, congratulations Hashicorp!"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Good essay overall, but this footnote in particular stood out to me:&gt; [2] Tiger parents, as parents so often do, are fighting the last war. Grades mattered more in the old days when the route to success was to acquire credentials while ascending some predefined ladder. But it&#39;s just as well that their tactics are focused on grades. How awful it would be if they invaded the territory of projects, and thereby gave their kids a distaste for this kind of work by forcing them to do it. Grades are already a grim, fake world, and aren&#39;t harmed much by parental interference, but working on one&#39;s own projects is a more delicate, private thing that could be damaged very easily.It&#39;s so true. I got obsessed with programming around 11, started off with my shitty vb6 programs and moved on to reverse engineering video games and writing hacks. I never told any adults what I was doing until I was nearly an adult myself, out of fear they&#39;d ruin my hobby like they did everything else. I remember thinking to myself how much school sucked and being determined not to let that poison the one thing I liked worked on. My parents thought I was a degenerate who did nothing but play computer games all day. Blew them away when I got my first programming job and eventually skipped college to start working right out of high school.I have a bunch of friends who say the same thing. They&#39;d find some new cool thing, show even the slightest interest in it and their mom would immediately start making them drill it three hours a day until they hated it and weren&#39;t interested in it anymore. It&#39;s a sad story."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Jared Diamond, in his book &#34;The Day Before Yesterday&#34;, talks about how children in Papua New Guinea when he was an anthropologist there would play at making a garden or raising pigs.  The kid would have a toy, wooden pig, and then eventually be given a piglet, and then gradually their &#34;play&#34; would become more realistic until it shaded into adult work.My daughter, as a youngun&#39;, wanted to play &#34;coffeeshop&#34; where she would set up a coffeeshop at home and charge her mother and I for drinks.  I think this says something about how much she saw the inside of coffeeshops while I was programming there.The main obstacle to still using the play-better-until-it&#39;s-real path, is that we don&#39;t have a good way for kids to see what adults are doing, in most jobs.  Otherwise, their natural instincts are still to &#34;play&#34; at doing what they see the adults doing."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Another aspect of personal projects is that if they’re truly enjoyable they can be a kind of salve for burnout.* If you feel like you can’t even open your IDE, a personal project can generate the excitement that reinvigorates your passion.There’s also less of a speed limit with personal projects — the things like: “before you go down that road let’s talk with X; hold off on that idea for now; let’s wait until...”This freedom is conducive to learning new things. My career success rests heavily on skills I gained pursuing personal projects, where I was able to try ridiculously complicated or “out there” ideas. I’ve worked for people in the past who were strongly against me spending free time on personal projects, but benefited from all the skills I had gained doing so. Beware of this mindset — it’s fear based and leads to unsuccessful outcomes in other ways.* Side note is: careful not to burn out on what’s supposed to be a fun personal project."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Nice that the cost has come down. Unfortunately, that which makes electric cars and planes feasible, namely energy density (Wh/litre) and specific energy (Wh/kg), has not improved that rapidly. The article mentions a factor of 3.4 over 30 years for energy density, ie 4% p.a., or doubling every 17 years. I think electric aircraft need another doubling or two in specific energy to become feasible, so another few decades :-/"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&gt; on the good side of things, getting an Intel CPU to enter the red state is not easy to accomplish. In fact, it should never happen unless there are vulnerabilities in the Intel Management Engine (ME), an almost undocumented subsystem present in all Intel CPUs since 2008 that Intel says is required to provide full performance.&#34;unless there are vulnerabilities or backdoors in the Intel Management Engine (ME)&#34;.There, fixed it for you."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"My initial guess was &#34;WRMSR, and the 64-bit version of WRMSR&#34;. Fortunately, this appears to be an actually new finding rather than the memorable case a few years back of someone claiming to have discovered something that was clearly documented in the datasheet.The whole idea that there&#39;s a &#34;red state&#34; and a bunch of others on a CPU, normally hidden, should immediately raise the attention of many who wonder what those extra modes can do, and more interestingly, why they&#39;re hidden. From the (very little!) research I&#39;ve done, it appears this is not unlike SGX where only Intel has the key[1] to some part of the hardware you bought from them, and based on some leaked internal documents, it&#39;s very plausible that this is indeed a backdoor which only they can use. Ostensibly, for debugging purposes. Here&#39;s a previous comment I made on this: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=26521359[1] If these keys were leaked, which I very much hope will happen at some point, no doubt the &#34;security&#34; community will be heavily against it and spread plenty of FUD about how it makes everyone&#39;s computers insecure. But IMHO it should be eagerly awaited and received with the same optimism as the other DRM key leaks (HDCP, HDDVD, etc.) --- it is a path to freedom."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The Australian Broadcasting Corporation is covering it in more detail than the Reuters article, including some of the mechanics of how it was pulled off:https://www.abc.net.au/news/2021-06-08/fbi-afp-underworld-cr...Apparently it revolved around duping Hakan Ayik, one of Australia&#39;s most wanted drug dealers now operating as an international kingpin from Turkey, to trust the app and recommend it to his associates.  It&#39;s a double whammy, in that the network has been blown wide open and the AFP is now telling Ayik to hand himself in to avoid recriminations from his associates.  No doubt there will be a movie about this one."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"As to how the FBI got access to the messages, Vice says[1] after Vincent Ramos of Phantom Secure was arrested in 2018, a confidential human source offered Anom, which the source was developing, to the FBI (probably in exchange for immunity or a reduced sentence, in my opinion). The source then seeded Anom phones to his existing distributors as a replacement for Phantom Secure phones, and from their they made their way into criminal organisations.[1] https://www.vice.com/en/article/akgkwj/operation-trojan-shie..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"What we&#39;ve learned is only what was in Austrlia&#39;s piece of the cake, given they started their day already. New Zeland had theirs already, too. I imagine thousands of arrests are still happening worldwide and several press conferences are going to be held today. Looking at the seal of the operation (https://www.anom.io/trojan_shield_seal.jpg), following countries participated in the operation:
Canada, Australia, US, Sweden, The Netherlands, Lithuania, Finland, Hungary, Norway, Austria, UK, New Zeland, Estonia, Scotland, Germany, Denmark.I expect this to be bigger than Panama Papers. Way bigger. I expect a few prominent politicians to be soon either arrested  or &#34;convinced&#34; to step down. I expect the US to have gained a lot of intel and leverage over those from the countries who did not participate in this. We will absolutely not learn about everything they discovered. CIA will and the respective intelligence agencies will.EDIT: Europol will hold their conference live on YouTube at 10 AM CST: https://twitter.com/janoorth/status/1402164252266409987EDIT 2: given how Serbia was in the top 4 of messages sent, I really hope that the info gathered will help Interpol fight child trafficking and exploitation in the EU.From the VICE article (https://www.vice.com/en/article/akgkwj/operation-trojan-shie...) quoted elsewhere here:&#34;Additionally, the review of Anom messages has initiated numerous high-level public corruption cases in several countries. The most prominent distributors are currently being investigated by the FBI for participating in an enterprise which promotes international drug trafficking, money laundering, and obstruction of justice.&#34;&#34;Late Monday, the FBI said that it would be holding &#34;a news conference announcing a massive worldwide takedown based on the San Diego FBI’s unprecedented investigation involving the interception of encrypted communications&#34; on Tuesday.&#34;"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&gt; Naturally, I took down my project right away...So a CEO bullied you. He threatened to have lawyers look at something, accused you of behaving poorly, and accused you of being difficult. He is being manipulative. He is trying to guilt / scare you into stopping. And it worked.For all readers... do not be afraid of lawyers. Especially if nobody has even talked to them yet. Lawyers do not like to lose cases, so will not push a losing agenda. Yet they also must do what their client asks, so lawyers looking into a concern, or even sending nastygrams... those are meaningless actions. It only becomes meaningful if and when if their lawyers indicate they believe they really have a case, or if your own lawyer believes they have a case. Everything before that is posturing and bullying.If I were in the same situation as OP, I&#39;d state that my intent was positive, ask to be informed of the results of discussions with attorneys, and wish them to have a nice day. Admit no wrong, make no apologies, ignore irrelevant statements (in particular personal attacks), and just let it slide until they take a real action of some kind.Once they do take an action, then it might be appropriate to do what they want. But seriously... stop letting people be bullies."</p>

After that I heard from my ex-coworkers that a manager from another area from the company told that I was fired because I was linking porn on some pages from our service. I didn’t knew at the time that those tools existed, but only today I realized that it is an option.I was really sad with that manager and didn’t understood the reason to lie to my friends the reason of my demission.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Seeing a lot of posts like this. Open source is wonderful in its way, but it&#39;s really not sustainable to work on projects that make money for other people - including big commercial interests - when they don&#39;t help out in any fashion. I&#39;m not just talking money or contributions. I&#39;m talking about simple acknowledgement: &#34;we use project X&#34; - even privately.A open source library that I worked on at Intel (the Hyperscan high performance regular expression library) had to shed most of its staff (including all the original folks who worked on it, including me). One of the big contributing factors was a sense that &#34;well, who really uses this&#34;. The answer was &#34;tons of people, including some major Intel target customers&#34; but a number of Hyperscan users picked up the library and never told anyone (not asking for public plaudits, but even a private communication would have been something to show our management).When you can&#39;t even say &#34;thank you, we&#39;re using your library now, it&#39;s great&#34; in a goddamn email, don&#39;t be surprised when 75% of the people maintaining and advancing it don&#39;t have jobs anymore. Never mind paying money or contributing - even acknowledgement.Open source is a recipe for burn-out. If something is important to people - especially corporate interests - there needs to be a way of getting paid. Much as I dislike those wacky &#34;free for non-commercial use, otherwise, give me a call&#34; licenses, I&#39;m starting to see the point."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"As somebody with experience in developing many OSS projects of different sizes (Redis, Hping, Jim Tcl, Visitors web analyzer, and many additional smaller ones), I think that the solution is simpler than it appears: just do what you want. When you are inside the flames of a successful open source project, you may think that the solution space is binary: don&#39;t do anything, or do everything people are demanding from you. Instead you can just keep doing what you want, cherry picking what issues you want to address, reply to, what features you want to add, and so forth. Just give you a fixed amount of time to spend on the project (in my case most of the time it was &#34;all the time I&#39;ve in a day, but up to 6/8 max&#34;, but it can be even just 10 minutes every day), and in this time do the things you like to do and ignore all the others. A few issues/PRs will be perfectly aligned to what you feel is right and you&#39;ll enjoy taking care of them. Others will not, and who cares?And anyway, doing things this way I was able to write a database that beaten, in the market, products developed with hundreds of developers while I was alone, so there must be some merit in what the original author feels is worth investing into. So, just do what you want, but:1. Don&#39;t fall in the trap of thinking that who asks you for things is doing some kind of mistake or abuse just because (for example) they are not paying you. Nope, they are fine asking for things, you are fine to ignore the requests.2. Don&#39;t fall in the trap that you are not accountable about the quality of the software just because it&#39;s free software: do only want you want, but ship finished work that is reasonably well written and well documented. To do what you want, at your own peace and according to your own personal expectation has NOTHING to do with the quality of your work. Software fails, but one thing is to ship terrible stuff just because &#34;Hey it&#39;s free&#34;, another thing is to do things the way you want, but with love.3. When people attack you, reply gently saying what you think. Don&#39;t get trapped into fights, don&#39;t feed the troll, remember that many criticizing you, if you are stealing money from the table providing something free, have specific agendas (but sometimes they are just assholes), and their goal is to mount a big case. Stop them replying carefully and without anger, then let the discussion end, or continue without you.4. Make good friends in the process. They&#39;ll help you immensely when there are hard times. Remember: the smartest people 99% of the times have a big hearth and are the most friendly."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"At my last gig I got budget to bring in the maintainer of an open-source testing library we using for some really important stuff.We paid him $1500 for a couple of days consulting. He showed us how to fix a couple of tricky bugs and gave a talk to the eng team. At this point we&#39;ve more than recouped the investment.He was psyched to see his tool being used and I feel the visit contributed to him continuing to maintain the project.After those two days we also tried to hire him (he declined because he was making bank elsewhere). But those two days were also the best interview process ever because we did hours of pairing in non-interview mode.If you&#39;re a senior dev at a tech company with money you can easily make this kind of thing happen and it&#39;s such a win-win"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I just want to throw my 2¢ out there, as a mid-20&#39;s who went to a high-rural-population high school, there&#39;s an entire new generation of farmers who have a) accepted that Deere&#39;s need constant/regular service calls, and b) don&#39;t care to learn how to fix it (or older equipment) themselves. At the end of the day farming is just a business same as any other, it&#39;s the same reason why a lot of trucking companies lease their trucks or warehouses lease their forklifts, it&#39;s generally cheaper and less of a headache overall.I&#39;ve tried to make pleas with some of my old friends who&#39;ve complained about the locked-down nature of their JD equipment, explaining that other companies like Kubota don&#39;t have that same limitation, but the branding is just too strong (&#34;the Kubota might be cheaper to buy, and cheaper to run, and I can easily maintain it myself, but, it&#39;s not a John Deere&#34; - actual quote from a SW Ontario farmer)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"No-one wants to sell hardware any longer, it&#39;s not as profitable as providing it on a subscription (dare we say &#34;rent&#34;) and forcing all support, maintenance and additions to go through your channels as part of the subscription package.Unfortunately this trend is everywhere now. It happened to servers, media, has started to happen to cars... but it&#39;s happened already to agricultural hardware.Super profitable if you are the provider (especially with all the data one can yield from operating the hardware), super annoying and frustrating if you are the consumer."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"diesel engine mechanic by trade here, and ive followed this topic with interest for about five years now.  Its similar to large over-the-road trucks in that its ultimately manufacturers catering to large fleets instead of owner/operators.most farms in America are corporate monoliths.  &#34;farmers&#34; here want mttf, mtbf, metrics, and a projection of how many cam chains, PTO knuckles, lockout converters, etc... they will need to buy in 30 years of depreciable service for a machine.  They want to be able to carve the machine they own down to the last cent...the only way to do that is to turn your IH or Komatsu into a rolling cloud.  even the windshield wipers get a sensor.smaller farms with actual farmers that wear hats and overalls already balk at a million dollar sticker shock from a harvester, and if you ever go to a farm and take a look around, most tractors there are nearly sixty years old.  the priority is farming, not investor return.  The tractor needs to perform its stated function first before anything else matters.  service interval warnings and degraded performance alerts here are a failure condition the farmer works around.  they arent incentivized to stop what theyre doing at 4:15 AM and call up the local JD dealer 143 miles away for an appointment.  there isnt a second tractor.If legislation isnt passed, ultimately youll end up with what commecial trucks got in response to sensor overkill:  Gliders.  gliders are 60 year old truck drivetrains and engines that get a new cab and body parts, and get recertified for the road.  they belch smog and roar like a freight train at idle, but all thats grandfathered into EPA legislation.  New manufacturers get to crank out fleet machines at high prices, and owner/operators get their old reliable filling the parking lot with NOx and waxy sulfur haze at 4 am.  they become a market that manufacturers refuse to tap, because it cannot be fully exploited to the disadvantage of the operator."</p>

I wonder what made them take this path?I also wonder if someone could build a Matrix bridge if it is available via web, that would be fairly cool.Some questions:- Is it phone-number based IDs? Or can I pick a username or get a random ID?- Is spam going to be a problem? Previous Apple had the advantage that you had to buy a multi-hundred dollar advice to call someone.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I&#39;ve experienced that repair shops ask &#34;and your password and username is?&#34;, many times when handing over my laptop - and i&#39;m always like &#34;what, no i&#39;m not giving you my password&#34; resulting in them looking surprised.Who the on earth gives their passwords, also all laptops should be encrypted by default. I find it absurd to give away the keys to your bank, search history, personal notes, images, whatever - it&#39;s beyond private and personal besides being economically dangerous and very bad job security wise for most jobs.Not blaming regular people though, but it&#39;s weird that people are so lax about giving the keys to absolutely everything."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Talented business consultant Nathan Fielder covered this topic not long ago.

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I wonder how many times this has happened and they didn&#39;t find out about it.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Not really sure why this was originally flagged (or this is possibly a dupe of the original post which was flagged?), but even though the comments that I&#39;ve seen so far are giving it a negative spin I think there are quite a few important points in the article about the way in which our (I&#39;m generalizing about the broad HN demographic) quite privileged lifestyles do have a concomitant cost for somebody who needs to service our day-to-day needs and wants.This ranges from everything like online shopping (I bought a pair of trainers yesterday on a Sunday afternoon, and they were shipped from the warehouse 2 hours later), to the people who are used in low-wage countries to make those trainers at a price I feel is &#39;affordable&#39;.I&#39;m reminded of a newspaper interview with a bank director here in Sweden a few years ago. She spoke at length about how we should accept that our children won&#39;t have regular jobs - they would have a few &#39;gig&#39; employments: driving a cab a few days each week before stocking shelves in the evening and maybe working part-time at an old-people&#39;s home. The obvious implication to me was that it was other people&#39;s children she was talking about not her&#39;s. On the contrary, they would obviously be sitting in the back of the cab, on their way to their well-paid career in banking, just like their mother."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"You have a 40+ hour workweek, until you put in enough intelligently focused 80 hour work weeks coupled with some dumb luck, to possibly arrive at anything resembling a 4 hour workweek.I&#39;m really tired of seeing online &#39;equality&#39; warriors think entrepreneurship is easy and should be used to pay for all of society&#39;s financial hardships; entrepreneurship is a significant toll that can cause financial ruin and mental instability just to have a chance at arriving at any sort of time liberation.When you create something you place your own time, finances, energy at risk - in many cases you get a low ROI in return. But like all educations, one can get better and improve over time.One must vision the system, design the system, find ways to finance the system, execute the system, manage the system, and optimize the processes. Then possibly, you might be able to receive benefits from that system - but it is in no way guaranteed.So don&#39;t pity the founder, but don&#39;t denigrate them either; actions taken on own volition mean founders must enjoy or live with the outcomes."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The author has crab in a bucket mindset. One person having enough success to have the lifestyle they want does not mean somebody they employ is being victimized by them. This might resonate with some, but for me it is a big turn-off. It smacks of jealousy and a rejection of all personal responsibility in charting a path to where you want to go in life.Tim&#39;s book isn&#39;t without flaws (and is now significantly dated in many of the details), but one of the core messages is to recognize we all have a choice to do something other than work 50 years at a job we hate and then retire/die. Tons of people go through life without considering any alternatives to the path they are on, or developing the self-knowledge about what they actually want, which is a big reason so many people end up so unhappy.He also emphasizes creating repeatable systems that you can then automate with software or hand off to other people. This helps you scale your business and income, but more importantly it preserves your time for other things you value more. The blog author thinks this is somehow a bad thing, but if nobody ever realized the efficiencies of exchanging money for services then most of us would be naked and starving; a huge chain of such exchanges is needed to produce the modern miracles of cheap clothing and food that are the foundation of modern living.Tim didn&#39;t actually retire to the beach for a hedonic 4-hour lifestyle with servants refilling the wine glass and fanning him with palm fronds; the guy works harder than most people with a new huge book every couple of years, lots of active investing, and running a major podcast almost every week. The difference between him and other people is that he&#39;s not wasting time on stuff that other people could do for him.I&#39;m not a &#34;bro&#34;, but I guess I&#39;ll stand here and defend Tim&#39;s book because it gave me a lot to think about."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Founder here,ToolJet is a no-code platform for building &amp; deploying custom internal tools. ToolJet is built using Ruby on Rails and ReactJS. ToolJet can connect to existing data sources of companies such as databases, Google sheets, API endpoints, external services, and more. ToolJet&#39;s drag and drop app builder can quickly create UI widgets such as tables, charts, forms, etc and connect these widgets with the data from data sources.I have been dabbling with the idea of ToolJet for a while. but the real progress happened over the last 7 weeks while I was in quarantine.  One of my family members tested positive for covid and then came to the state-mandated lockdown. Not being able to step out of my home has been particularly hard, but nevertheless gave birth to ToolJet.I believe that the tools that require access to sensitive data should be self-hosted ( data never leaves the premises) and open-source ( modify the software to fit organization-specific requirements )."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I feel like low-code apps like this have hit commodity level.A bit of history - in the late 90s, you could (and we did) build a multi-million dollar product doing basic content management for plain old web pages. That heydey lasted a couple years before Wordpress and other such tools came around and basic CMS was more of a solved problem than a unique product.The same has occurred over the years in multiple niches - a tool that would have been a terrific SaaS at one point gets built out, normalized, and well understood... to the point that it is no longer a unique value prop to just build a tool that solves problem X. You need to build the tool AND have some unique perspective and value prop that escalates it above all the others.Low-code CRUD builders with DB integration and some basic workflow, reporting, and security now have hit that mark. There have always been big players in this market (Microsoft, IBM, Salesforce, etc.) It is good to see smaller players coming into their  own in recent years, and this specific one is open source, which is a nice differentiator between it and many others."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Pretty cool project to build in 7 weeks! Congratulations! Your lockdown has been way more productive than for some of us.I&#39;m a founder of Appsmith, which Tooljet mentions in the GitHub project as an inspiration. https://github.com/appsmithorg/appsmithWe are an Apache 2.0 licensed internal apps builder that&#39;s being used by teams in Adobe, IBM, MSFT, Rappi, Swiggy, and 1000&#39;s of other companies.Difference vs. other projects mentioned here:
1. Community edition is free for unlimited users
2. Great developer experience(local development, debugging, &amp; Git sync is coming soon)
3. Pricing model will be usage based and not user based"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"There are many parallels with seismic interpretation here.  Many companies/etc keep promising to &#34;revolutionize&#34; interpretation and remove the need for the &#34;tedious&#34; work of a geologist/geophysicist. This is very appealing to management for a wide variety of reasons, so it gets a lot of funding.What folks miss is that an interpreter _isn&#39;t_ just drawing lines / picking reflectors.  That&#39;s less than 1% of the time spent, if you&#39;re doing it right.Instead, the interpreter&#39;s role is to incorporate all of the information from _outside_ the image.  E.g. &#34;sure we see this here, but it can&#39;t be X because we see Y in this other area&#34;, or &#34;there must be a fault in this unimaged area because we see a fold 10 km away&#34;.By definition, you&#39;re in a data poor environment.  The features you&#39;re interested in are almost never what&#39;s clearly imaged -- instead, you&#39;re predicting what&#39;s in that unimaged, &#34;mushy&#34; area over there through fundamental laws of physics like conservation of mass and understanding of the larger regional context.  Those are deeply difficult to incorporate in machine learning in practice.Put a different way, the role is not to come up with a reasonable realization from an image or detect feature X in an image.  It&#39;s to outline the entire space of physically valid solutions and, most importantly, reject the non-physically valid solutions."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Radiologists are not even trying. They treat their methods like FDA-approved medical devices. Even basic image segmentation to help with 3D structure recognition is off-limits. The benefits of neural networks in diagnostic radiology will not occur in one shot, and I don’t think it will happen at all in the United States until people start sending their data elsewhere. But good luck getting it. I just got my CT scan from a total mis-diagnosis that resulted in an unnecessary surgery. It came on a CD that won’t read in the only drive I have access to. And even that is just images. It’s not possible to get the actual data. This is not a failure of DNN. This is active AMA hostility toward technology, and not just in radiology. Just watch, people are going to start going elsewhere for medical care. They will do everything they can to get insurance requirements, subsidies, and laws against it, but they will lose. They are a dishonest Luddite cartel, and they’re hurting people."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Radiologist here with an interest in this topic. I think the problem with most AI applications in radiology thus far is that they simply don&#39;t add enough value to the system to gain widespread use. If something truly revolutionary comes along, and it causes a clinical benefit, healthcare systems will shift to adapt this in a few years. AI just hasn&#39;t lived up to it&#39;s promise, and I agree it&#39;s because most of the people involved don&#39;t get that the job of a radiologist is way more complex than they think it is.Everytime I open a journal, I see more examples of either downright AI nonsense (&#39;We used AI to detect COVID by the sounds of a cough&#39;) or stuff that&#39;s just cooked up in a lab somewhere for a publication (&#39;Our algorithm can detect pathology X with an accuracy of 95%, here&#39;s our AUC&#39;).Hyperbolic headlines - Geoff Hinton saying in 2016 that it&#39;s time to stop training radiologists springs to mind - don&#39;t help the over promise of AI, and then they shoot themselves in the foot when they underdeliver.Earlier discussions about radiologists being self interested in sabotaging AI is tinfoil hat stuff - if I had an AI algorithm in the morning that could sort out the 20 lung nodules in a scan, or tell me which MS plaque is new in a field of 40, I&#39;d be able to report twice as many scans and make twice as much money.Companies come along every month promising their AI pixie dust is going to improve your life. It probably will, but 10 years from now, not today. The AI Rad companies are caught in an endless hype cycle of overpromising and under delivering."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"It&#39;s a good list, but like most (all?) of these lists it doesn&#39;t offer too much advice on organizational best practices.IMO a security program which cannot justify its own worth to others in the organization is incomplete.Most security professionals I&#39;ve met (and I&#39;ve been one of them, too) assume that security is or should be everyone&#39;s top priority. They struggle to deal with people for whom security is just one of many competing concerns."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I think of myself as pretty security-conscious. But it&#39;s striking to me just how _long_ this list is. Even as someone who is trying to constantly think about this stuff, if I were faced with a list of this magnitude, I&#39;d be tempted to throw in the towel and admit defeat right off the bat. It&#39;s no wonder so many SaaSes end up getting exposed. Even with a lot of best practices built in to so many cloud providers... how did we as an industry end up in a place where it&#39;s this dang hard to keep systems secure?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This list is the &#34;brute force&#34; security algo. Eg &#39;just make everything more secure&#39;. This would have someone upgrading a door lock with a hole in an adjacent wall.There are at least the following major factors:* what might happen (event A,B, ...) ?* how probable is eventi?* what is the cost if eventi happens?* how can one deal with eventi? (action 1, 2 ...) ?* how much / how long does actioni take?* what actions should we perform with the skills/resources/time we have?My algo:1 enumerate possible security issues2 assign approx probability and cost to business3 re-order by prob*cost4 imagine ways to address issues, assign cost to address5 decide on courses to address issues6 for next epoch, address issues7 goto 1"</p>

So these ships go in and out at the 200 miles that limit the international waters. It’s easy to see by satellite, but hard to control with a small and under equipped coast patrol."</p>

I had to track it down myself for a bootstrap.sh, but I don&#39;t like using undocumented sources for critical infrastructure.My use case was needing to set the result of `hostname -f` in /etc/hosts in an automated fashion if a VPS provider didn&#39;t already add a line for the public Internet address in that file. You need to do this so that sendmail doesn&#39;t fail on `apt install` when it attempts to read your FQDN. So I couldn&#39;t use the NGINX example posted elsewhere here.It seems like https://checkip.amazonaws.com/ is much more &#34;reliable&#34; in that it is publicly documented at https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-net/v3/developer-guide/s....To anyone who needs to read this: please don&#39;t use &#34;services&#34; like icanhazip for your provisioning.

This, in my mind, is one of the big differences between a senior and a staff engineer (where such distinctions exist).I highly recommend this article on &#34;giving away your Legos&#34;: https://review.firstround.com/give-away-your-legos-and-other.... Have shared it with many senior engineers that were looking to grow to the next level.Oh, and +1 to the author&#39;s book &#34;The Manager&#39;s Path&#34;. Best one I&#39;ve seen for anyone looking to go down that road."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Yea no, can we stop putting ALL of the weight on the technical people that already are MASSIVELY skilled on their field and are chronically overworked? The soft people skills responsibilities fall on the soft skills people i.e. management. That is THEIR job, not mine. They can&#39;t do shit else so they better do at least that.This is the fundamental problem with our profession, we are goal oriented and try to make things work at all cost, and we get taken advantage all the time even when we are holding all the cards (high demand for us, low supply).Stop making their work easy by making yours hard, you are not a fcking lap boy, you are an engineer, you solve the technical sht. Make the &#34;management and meetings&#34; people earn their over inflated checks or simply move to the next job for an even better pay, simple as that.All my PM, TL, RRHH, QA, and the rest of the spreed sheet crowd have always been the same: Lest waste an hour every day in a pointless meeting to show them who is boss and pretend that we do something useful, then lets spend the rest of the day in Facebook and social media while I pest the nerds on chat every few hours asking &#34;how is that going? do you have an estimate?&#34;. That is not working, that is been a parasite. Force them to earn their living."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"From the perspective of a diesel engine tech, this is a controversial opinion, but I&#39;m absolutely glad to see this breakthrough.Lithium is a conflict resource.  its scarce, its hard to mine, and as a result so far electric cars are a fanciful plaything for what i would consider &#34;the rich.&#34;  This paves the way for electric cars that a working class mom and dad can afford to get to and from work and the store.  and of course electric trucks that have obscene amounts of torque means never &#34;getting stuck&#34; behind a slow truck ever again. it also means cleaner cities and hopefully cheaper trucking for over the road drivers and owner/operators.Ive told my coworkers and apprentices this for as long as i can remember:  expect to service elecric long-haul trucks in your lifetime.  Learn the powertrain, the dynamics, the performance characteristics and keep pace with the technology as it evolves.  Make it part of your expectation in the future, because the economic model of diesel is a last-ditch effort at best in the 21st century."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Adding another solution to the issue of mining lithium for batteries at scale is awesome, I hope they find a way to deal with the brine that this produces (Edit: it does not really produce brine in the classical sense according to the paper [0]).Maybe this process could be a way to deal with brine from seawater desalination [1] by at least removing lithium ions from the waste water. Since the ion concentration in the waste water is higher than in seawater, it should theoretically make the lithium separation process easier, shouldn&#39;t it?Another thing: combining this with cheap solar power and seawater lithium mining might be a part of a possible solution for a post-oil industry in the Gulf States? They did the tests on Red Sea seawater which has a higher salinity than most other seawater but apparantly the eastern Mediterranean matches or even surpasses that [2].[0] &#34;It is also noted that the total concentration of other salts after the first stage is less than 500 ppm, which implies that after lithium harvest, the remaining water can be treated as freshwater. Hence, the process also has a potential to integrate with seawater desalination to further enhance its economic viability&#34;, from page 5, (PDF) https://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlepdf/2021/ee/d1ee00354...[1] I am not linking to a particular article but this is what I am talking about: https://www.google.de/search?q=toxic+brine+seawater+drinking...[2] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salinity#/media/File:WOA09_sea..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"They&#39;re still at the bench-top stage with this, from the pictures. This is something that ought to work, since lithium is commercially extracted from denser brines.[1] Extraction from seawater is quite possible but not yet cost-effective. So cost is the big question. This is the usual problem when articles announcing &#34;cheap and easy&#34; come from the surface-chemistry crowd.The authors write &#34;a preliminary economic analysis shows that the process can be made profitable when coupled with the chlor-alkali industry.&#34; So they apparently want to run this off of the reject stream from a plant that extracts chlorine and sodium hydroxide from brine. Running this downstream of a chlor-alkali plant means somebody else already has a brine source and a way to get rid of all the rejected brine. This sort of thing is common. A lot of rare mineral extraction is done as part of a process that extracts a less-rare mineral.Profitability is going to turn on all the usual problems with membrane systems - how long does the membrane last, how often does it have to be backwashed, what parts in the system corrode, and similar routine engineering problems. That&#39;s usually the hard part.[1] https://www.samcotech.com/is-it-possible-to-extract-lithium-..."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I&#39;m a little disappointed in the conclusion because there are more secure password managers out there that still offer the same level of convenience as the browser built-in password manager. Yes, if you use a password manager that&#39;s implemented entirely as a browser extension, you may as well use the browser&#39;s built-in password management features. However, if you&#39;re an advanced user and are comfortable using a separate password management application, there are options out there that don&#39;t force you to choose between a difficult-to-use app and the convenience of something in-browser.For example, exploiting a browser-based password manager likely means escaping the sandbox that contains web pages and accessing the shadow DOM. But this is still a larger surface area than 1Password, where the password selection menu (on Windows at least...) is actually rendered by an entirely separate process on the system. (I.e., clicking the icons that the extension displays triggers the 1Password desktop application to display UI at the cursor&#39;s current position. Picking a password from this UI will transmit it to the browser extension for filling. The password is only present in the browser&#39;s memory once you&#39;ve interacted with the desktop application&#39;s UI.)As always, do your research. Don&#39;t get suckered into paying a subscription fee for a browser extension that offers the same functionality your browser has built-in. But realize that there are other options out there that may actually be worth investing in.Disclaimer: I&#39;ve been a happy 1Password customer for a few years now."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This somewhat overlooks the main threat model that password managers solve - leaked credentials.People can’t remember 80 passwords so they reuse the same one, that password eventually gets leaked and 9/10 times it doesn’t get leaked due to a targeted attack or a compromised machine but rather due to a breach of a service you signed up too.Sure password managers have issues, they don’t solve user related errors and can even add to the attack surface of a machine they are running on but that’s really not important...Using password managers and generating different passwords for each service reduces the blast radius from any breach.This is why I don’t care if the password manager has the best encryption, or does it even encrypts at all or does it uses the clipboard vs some more secure side channel. Yeah that’s nice but that’s not in my threat model.Which is why I don’t care if your password manager is a spreadsheet, it’s a terrible choice for a business because their threat landscape and the fact that a spreadsheet won’t allow you to audit who has access to what but for you or your mom even that is better than using the same password everywhere else.Heck at home print your passwords and store them somewhere safe... put them on a post note for all I care as long as you live alone or at least not with anyone you wouldn’t want stumbling on that list..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"As it looks like Tavis isn&#39;t hanging out and responding to comments here, I thought it&#39;d be worth linking to a question and response he gave on Twitter as most comments revolve around this point.&gt; @diractelda: Based on your thoughts, it seems a more accurate statement is &#34;Don&#39;t use a password manager that interacts with your browser automatically unless it&#39;s the built in password system. Non-integrated password stores are fine.&#34;&gt; @tavis: Yep, that&#39;s a fair summary, I was just trying to be punchyhttps://twitter.com/taviso/status/1401253440622235649?s=20"</p>

This means adding image descriptions and offering various text alterations (different text sizes, special fonts and colors, etc.) to make them easier to read. They also offer math-based tools to make equations accessible.Bookshare is 100% free to any US-based student who qualifies, and various other countries have agreements with Bookshare as well.

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I had a student with limited vision in a class once, who had a reader.  Luckily, I had written the course notes (basically a textbook) in latex.I consulted with the student and saw how the reader worked. All was fine, but it was slow because it said e.g. &#34;backslash begin open brace equation close brace&#34;, so I made a perlscript to remove backslash and braces (and a few other things) and then it all worked really well.People, especially those who don&#39;t use mathematics much, think latex is hard for humans.  I think exactly the reverse is true."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This article is a general critique of the reward system in academia, bolted on the lab leak hypothesis for clickbait. &#34;The Science Game&#34; is a thing and often discussed on HN, but I don&#39;t see any causative link here.&gt; All to say: scientists create dangerous synthetic viruses to achieve “high-impact” scientific output.Does gain of function research yield more high impact papers than  more benign types of virology research? The article seems to suggest so, but provides no citations indicating that. Were the scientists at the Wuhan Institute of Virology publishing their research to general acclaim up until now? Given how little we know about it, doesn&#39;t seem so. Are these scientists driven by the same invectives as western university research academics? They&#39;re probably state employees on stable contracts for a start, not the PhD students and itinerant PostDocs of the university system, who are the main players of the Science Game.I don&#39;t know the answers to these questions, but the article would be more persuasive if it did."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I used to work in one of the top fMRI labs. The comments about The Science Game are spot on. The vast majority of scientists, by the time they&#39;re midway through their postdocs, just want to do whatever research will get them a professorship and some grants. Actual knowledge generation is a distant second to keeping the ball bouncing by getting out papers and getting in grants."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; .. may one day pose similar risks due to the run-away prestige games scientists play.It is happening in front of our eyes. From where should we start.(1) Responsible AI, but the outcomes didn&#39;t challenge AI research enough to stop some of the practices. I would avoid commenting on what happened at Google AI recently, but I would say that most of the AI-based solutions that are deployed at large scale can be challenged.(2) paperswithcode.com solved this issue. Back in the day, we would re-implement models that we see in the paper. When we email authors, we will always figure that an RA implemented the solution and s/he left.(4) Rich is becoming richer. There is a phenomena in academia to blindly trust those who are in good labs. I have seen many papers that are great coming from these labs, but there are bad papers as well. we shouldn&#39;t just blindly trust ppl.(5) Review process is broken. Review is a voluntarily work for professors, and imho it shouldn&#39;t. In industrial R&amp;D, reviews are one of the most important things as part of the work. Some of our PRs takes days.(6) All recommendation engines are black-boxes. I don&#39;t know what YT or FB recommend to a kid and whether this is aligned with some of our values. If s/he accidentally watch something bad, we noticed that their timeline is full by the same ideas. In our spare time, we tried to check if we can influence this behavior as a user. I figured that all of our recommendations engines are black-boxes. I don&#39;t know why we don&#39;t challenges. I hacked an App to fetch data, new, feed and run it through recommendation engine and started customizing what I can read.(7) It&#39;s 2021, most of good papers are coming from industrial labs."</p>
