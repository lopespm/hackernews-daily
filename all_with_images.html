								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"On the Hotel California EffectIf it&#39;s expensive to move data out of AWS, it&#39;s not just about making it hard for customers to leave AWS. It means that any third-party service that wants to sell to AWS customers must also use AWS.For example, Snowflake can&#39;t really run its own data centers. They need to rent from AWS. If you&#39;re a company on AWS, you won&#39;t want to spend $0.08/GB sending things to Snowflake.The high egress cost gives Amazon a lot of power to keep the third-party ecosystem within AWS and without as much negotiating power on things like EC2 costs. Snowflake can&#39;t say to Amazon, &#34;if you don&#39;t give us a great discount, we&#39;re going to move our operations to DigitalOcean&#34; because Amazon would just say, &#34;no you&#39;re not. Your customers aren&#39;t going to pay $80/TB to load things into Snowflake when you&#39;re charging them $23-40/TB for storage. They&#39;d be paying 2-3.5x your storage costs just to load the data into your system!&#34; Yes, I&#39;m sure that Snowflake does get a discount from AWS, but having less negotiating power can make discounts smaller.There are other reasons to want a third party to use AWS if you&#39;re on AWS. Still, the egress pricing seems to make it very hard for third-party tech providers not to use AWS if their customers are using it."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Working in realtime games that require high bandwidth usage, AWS and basically every other public cloud is fundamentally unusable for us because of this exact problem. Our bare metal infrastructure for the Hypixel Minecraft network uses 3-4PB per month, so we simply lease a 100gbps transit link billed at 95th percentile.Last I checked, AWS wanted ~$200k per MONTH, for just bandwidth (no compute, memory, storage, or anything else). We&#39;d love to be able to use the cloud, but not at the cost of increasing our monthly expenses by an entire order of magnitude, so we just stick to bare metal colocation.I honestly believe that if you have the technical skill in-house, and are spending more than, say, $30k/mo on public cloud hosting, that you should seriously evaluate whether bare metal could significantly decrease your costs."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"AWS Egress - $0.09/GBAzure Egress - $0.0875/GBGCP Egress - $0.11/GBAlibaba Egress - $0.123Interesting that no mention is made of the other cloud providers pricing here when AWS isn&#39;t even the most expensive egress...Oh! I wonder if it is because Cloudflare has data transfer agreements with GCP, Azure, and Alibaba! But that would mean this is a shoddy hit piece to strong arm AWS into an agreement with them. Nonsense, I&#39;m sure Cloudflare would never do that...Edit: I&#39;ve removed claims about Cloudfront&#39;s pricing since it isn&#39;t actually clear what they charge for egress and seems to vary on a number of factors. Thanks Dylan16807 for pointing that out."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I had this idea nearly 10 years ago when my wife and I started dating and she introduced me to (very amateur) birding. I even talked about contacting Cornell for their database. But it was always going to be a hobby project.So when she read about this a few weeks ago, she literally smacked me for not building it. Now if I tell her it&#39;s on the front page of Hacker News AND everyone here loves the idea even more, I&#39;m going to get another, harder smack because she knows how HN is full of others like me!(yes I&#39;m aware that this community more than others will agree that ideas by themselves are a dime a dozen, but nonetheless, it would&#39;ve been a really fun project)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"How can computers learn to recognize birds from sounds?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is exactly the kind of thing that keeps me coming back to HN year after year. 99% may be a quick, mildly entertaining read, but that 1% tends to be empowering or life changing for me. I&#39;ve had a continuously growing interest in plant and bird identification as a hobby (animals are a bit  easier). I&#39;ve gone so far as to research apps, put Audobon society books on my wishlist, and try to look up some specimens I see in my area. Unfortunately it&#39;s, frankly, a steep learning curve and not a habit yet for me to take pictures, remember to look at them later, search their characteristics, etc. This will be the perfect tool to help me jumpstart my newfound interest and get more familiar with the flora and fauna around my home."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"That&#39;s a fun read.I once wrote an entire CMS in Perl.I still wake up, screaming, sometimes.[UPDATE] It appears as if my flippant remark caused upset. I am sincerely sorry that this was the case. No offense was meant.@peteretep, you have my sincere apology. It was a flippant remark. At the time I wrote it (mid-1990s), Perl was the best way to write portable server-side code. I took the time to learn it, and got fairly good at it.
Since then, I have found my muse in other languages, but I sincerely did not want to give offense. I doubt that deleting the comment would help."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"In university, I learned Perl out of curiousity. It was the first scripting language I tried; I was only familiar with Java, C and Scheme at the time.After reading Programming Perl from cover-to-cover, I suddenly felt like I had superpowers. I probably would have felt the same if I&#39;d taken the time to learn bash scripting, but that&#39;s not how it worked out.I tried to automate everything in my life with Perl. I&#39;d walk to class in the morning and a script had already scraped and downloaded my lecture materials and sent a print job for me. It emailed me if it couldn&#39;t find notes for one of my scheduled classes. Others would manage my assignment submissions. I wrote scrapers to detect what events on campus might offer free food.This was the first time I felt like I could write programs that actually had the power to improve my life. It changed my perspective on what I had the power to do as a programmer. I&#39;ll always be grateful to Perl for that.I also learned how to quickly develop a thick programmer skin by asking questions on comp.lang.perl, but that&#39;s another topic altogether."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Syncthing is one of the &#34;fire and forget&#34; kind of programs. It takes some time to setup when doing for first time, but then you pretty much forget its there, and when you need it, you realise it has been chugging along doing its job.Two things I like about it in particular, are1. It can and favors syncing over local network. This has a huge cost savings in developing world. Even when you do have massive bandwidth, local network sync still has more throughput and lower latency. My music is shared between devices and if I add a track, it takes less than a second to appear on my other devices.2. You can set conditions, such that delets can be ignored. Eg. I have a WhatsApp message+media backup going back almost 7 years now, ~65GiB. But I don&#39;t need all that on my phone. So I just disable syncing delets on my storage. Now my phone can get away with ~3 GiB of whatsapp data (only because I don&#39;t delete very often) and I still have complete backup in case I need it.3. Absolute rock solid stable. At $DAYJOB we use syncthing to sync multi dozen GiBs of new data every day, total file count in 10s of thousands in about ~300 directories. And in past 5 years we have had about 3 instances where we had something that needed attention, out of which 2 were not syncthing&#39;s fault.I&#39;ve been using Syncthing for years and have absolutely zero complaints against it. Everyone with 2 or more devices should give it a try, just to see there are better options out there."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;ve been using Syncthing for years now, between ~10 Linux servers, Linux desktops, Linux and Windows laptops and Android smartphones, over LAN, wired and wireless Internet.I&#39;m synchronizing less than 100 MiB of data, but it&#39;s changing all the time. I&#39;ve not yet had a single issue with it. I&#39;ve a few conflicts every week when the same file is changed in different locations at the same time, but Syncthing keeps all versions of a file until I resolve the conflicts; I can&#39;t see how it could handle that better.Long story short: I highly recommend this tool."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"On of my favorite program, and it keeps getting better.You can even set an encryption key per share, and if you want to use an untrusted device in your nodes, you can simply not provide it with the encryption key and it will simply synchronize the encrypted payload across nodes.So if you have a shady/cheapo VPS, you can use its storage without worrying about the plaintext data being stored there."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Fantastic blog post. I highly recommend reading it in full, and also checking out the work of the European Spreadsheet Risks Group, and Felienne Hermans specifically (referenced in the original post). I&#39;ve been working on a spreadsheet startup [1] for the past 8 months or so and those folks have a large amount of absolutely upsetting-but-helpful research on spreadsheet usage/errors.After the past few years working with spreadsheet power users, here&#39;s how I like to think about them:
1. Most spreadsheets are just used a lists/trackers [2].
2. Some spreadsheets are very calculation heavy, and are better understood as complex software projects (usually modeling something; s/o to those PE mfs) than as anything else.
3. Spreadsheets make the transition between (simple list/tracker) and (complex software project very fluid. This flexibility usually means that the (complex software project) that is created is buggy as hell.Spreadsheets give not-super-technical users an incredible visibility into their data. Spreadsheets give not-super-technical users a way to program data transformations in what I would argue is the most generally intuitive way that exists. Spreadsheets give not-super-technical users tools to build software without introducing them to proper software development methods. Ya know, like maybe a test. Or a code review. Or no global variables. Etc.If you want to see how we&#39;re attacking the spreadsheet problem, check us out. Feedback highly appreciated! [1][1] https://trymito.io/hn

								<p class="story__comment_others">"&#39;000s of rows of data in a spreadsheet - sigh. But say &#39;database&#39; to some people and they hear &#39;The Devil&#39;.Excel is a glorious tool which welcomes all, the savvy and the unskilled but imaginative newbies alike. There is something about all those little cells that presents an itch everyone wants to scratch, and you just know that for some that scratching is going to produce something akin to a spreadsheet version of gangrenous melanoma.On the other hand, some people are happy to say that the complexity of sophisticated Excel models means they would have been better off built in a code interface. Ha ha ha!Even with the right mix of functional and object-oriented code and suitable documentation and version control applied to code, I respectfully disagree.Data handling capabilities could benefit from skill in all of these tools: error checking (including analytical review); pen &amp; paper; calculators; databases; spreadsheets; math &amp; stat techniques; Word processors (&amp; clear logical explanations).Together, they form a rich menagerie of tools which will probably all be around until we have an AI that follows us around and we just tell it what we want. Actually, even then, it would be good to know them so that we can grasp the underlying logic and frame the concepts leading to the actions that we ask the AI to assist with..."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"In my experience, for a pure engineering role, nobody seems to care. I had credits at large companies, posted talks online (interviewers rarely looked at them), but if I forgot how to write binary search in 10 minutes in an interview it didn’t matter.This actually made me realize being just an IC wasn’t actually my goal though. Once I started interviewing for management and sales, all of those things _really_ mattered. Now that I’m running workshops and talks professionally, posting publicly is _critical_.Moral of the story: if you enjoy posting in public and teaching in public, but you feel like its getting you nowhere career wise, maybe you are in the wrong career like I was. Once I decided to double down on my strengths and spent nights and weekends at public speaking training instead of grinding leetcode things started to click."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"There are two modes of hiring:1. General purpose: Typical FANG like where hire first and then do team matching later2. Targeted hiring: Companies want specific people and they try to recruit themA sizable number of top open-source contributors get recruited are in #2. Eg. 1) Top contributors in Rust lang hired by AWS. 2) FANG companies targeting top AI researchers from academia.One&#39;s open-source presence needs to be really prolific and the project has to make an large impact to be in #2 category.For #1 category folks, your public profile does not matter that much (atleast for FANG companies)Other way to think is #1 are treated as cattle, #2 are treated as pets.The famous incident where author of homebrew was rejected by a top company because he could not invert a binary tree got in the wrong channel (#1) to begin with where he was treated as a cattle.Note: Recruiter from FANG calling you still goes in #1 category for most people"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I had a few jobs interview recently. Here&#39;s what I got out of it:If you have something you want to promote (or is on your CV in general), be ready to talk about it. I&#39;m very lucky because I can talk about things on the spot very easily. If that&#39;s not you, make a list of the few main points that you want to talk about and try to memorize it. If you always get the same questions, it may be a good idea to address them before people even ask them, or to memorize an answer to them too.I really underestimate the amount of stress that can be felt when you&#39;re alone facing 6 people for a job that you want. I don&#39;t have a good answer on how to handle it, although I think having my canned answer ready helped. It got better once this started to be a conversation. The good part is that I developed a lot of empathy for people that talk about interview stress.It&#39;s going to be my first &#34;real&#34; job so these are probably obvious, but it might help someone so I&#39;d rather share."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Deploying k8s has gotten a lot easier these days -- some alternatives in this space:- https://docs.k0sproject.io (https://github.com/k0sproject/k0s)- https://k3s.io (https://github.com/k3s-io/k3s/)k0s is my personal favorite and what I run, the decisions they have made align very well with how I want to run my clusters versus k3s which is similar but slightly different. Of course you also can&#39;t go wrong with kubeadm[0][1] -- it was good enough to use minimally (as in you could imagine sprinkling a tiny bit of ansible and maintaining a cluster easily) years ago, and has only gotten better.[0]: https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/setup-tools/kubeadm/[1]: https://github.com/kubernetes/kubeadm"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I tried a few incarnations of self-hosted k8s a few years ago, and the biggest problem I had was persistent storage. If you are using a cloud service they will integrate k8s into whatever persistent storage they offer, but if you are self-hosting you are left on your own, it seems most people end up using something like nfs or hostPath - but that ends up being a single point of failure. Have there been any developments on this recently, aimed at people wanted to run k8s on a few RaspberryPi nodes?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"(Full disclaimer - I&#39;m an engineer at Talos, but I believe it&#39;s pretty relevant here)If folks are interested in this kind of K8s deployment, they might also be interested at what we&#39;re doing at Talos (https://talos.dev). We have full support for all of these same environments (we have a great community of k8s-at-home folks running with Raspberry Pis) and a bunch of tooling to make bare metal easier with Cluster API. You can also do the minikube type of thing by running Talos directly in Docker or QEMU with `talosctl`.Talos works with an API instead of SSH/Bash, so there&#39;s some interesting things about ease of use when operating K8s that are baked in like built-in etcd backup/restore, k8s upgrades, etc.We&#39;re also right in the middle of building out our next release that will have native Wireguard functionality and enable truly hybrid K8s clusters. This should be a big deal for edge deployments and we&#39;re super excited about it."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"As an employee of Hashicorp, I&#39;m very excited for this change. Not that Mitchell was anything less than a great leader—on the contrary, I thought he was excellent. It&#39;s just that he&#39;s also got such a great ability to identify the right abstractions when tackling a problem. The fact that he&#39;ll be &#34;in the trenches&#34;, so to speak, gives me even more confidence that Hashicorp will continue to make tools that strike a nice balance between power and simplicity."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Well done. A very graceful and transparent announcement.I decided to leave senior leadership and return to IC engineering work last year. I was met with shock and, frankly, negative feedback from my peers. It has been a difficult transition, and it&#39;s easy to miss the benefits of leadership, but I knew engineering was the right place for me.It was difficult to do this as a veritable nobody, I can&#39;t even imagine the difficulty of the decision for Mitchell. I wish him luck and continued success."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Such a great guy. At Hashiconf a few years ago he was just one of the normal people, a load of us all went to the speakers’ dinner and he just found a seat and sat down - opposite me, as it happened, and we had a laugh. Armon is a top chap too, we would talk motorbikes if I ever bump into him. Their tech skills are top-notch and I wish them the best of luck. So many tech companies would be better off this way."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"It&#39;s sort of mentioned, but not emphasized in this review that connection dropouts happen every few minutes for a few seconds. That makes starlink fine for any kind of asynchronous content like web browsing, torrenting or video streaming, but unusable for video calls, stream hosting, voip, or online gaming. It&#39;s implied that this is due to the trees obstructing a full view of the sky, but I have actually heard these connection dropouts are just about universal due to the constellation not having enough infill. Just a warning that for most of us we are still several hundred satellites short and some connection handoff updates away from this being a useful internet connection.I have a property where Starlink would be perfect and I would pay triple the price to be able to do zoom calls over the connection."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;ve had Starlink for about 6 months and it is a massive improvement on upload speed at 10-25 Mb. Download speed is a mixed bag wildly oscillating from 5 to 100 Mb and back. It&#39;s okay for downloading things but it&#39;s terrible for any sort of video conferencing. There are brief dropouts on average every 6 minutes or so and my obstruction map is better than the author&#39;s. My neighbor up the street got slightly better service by mounting his dishy on a 20-ft antenna pole above his house.Local ground service is 20 Mb download and 2 Mb upload. And that&#39;s just barely sufficient for watching streaming video and video conferencing. Gigabit service is but a mile and a half away but no one is going to pay to lay the fiber into our neighborhood. So the last mile and a half is copper from 20 years ago. I think that&#39;s going to require political will to fix and I don&#39;t think that political will exists right now nor will it in the near future. We could have paid $5,000 per house to lay it ourself but our own neighborhood couldn&#39;t come to consensus on that. Now imagine that at a national level.So if they just deliver 100/100 within a year or two, this is an epic win IMO and I will cancel ground service. And if they don&#39;t someone else will so I&#39;m not worried. But it took Teslas to spark the electric vehicle industry. Now there&#39;s a lot of choice. I wouldn&#39;t be surprised if something similar happens here."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;m typing this message from Starlink. For me it&#39;s absolutely transformative; 10x the bandwidth I can get from any other source and very reliable.Except for outages related to obstructions. That&#39;s a real problem and the author&#39;s situation is not good. There&#39;s ways to work around it on your property; a taller mount, a tree install, cutting some trees. But ultimately Dishy needs a clear view to the north and there&#39;s no getting around it.I have some smaller obstructions for my install and it was a little annoying but fine. But in the past week or two it&#39;s gotten way better: my packet loss went from 2% to 0.6%. Details here: https://nelsonslog.wordpress.com/2021/07/20/starlink-improve..."</p>

I tore the entire thing apart and there&#39;s just no way to replace anything besides the SSD drive, everything else is soldered on.  I&#39;m in Batch 1 and can&#39;t wait to get my full purchase email.  I seriously see this as an investment.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The article doesn&#39;t mention it - and I can&#39;t find it anywhere - but in any neighborhood what is the highest proportion of units that are short-term rentals. Five percent? Ten percent in the super touristy areas? I have no idea and even before the other flaws in the study I am skeptical than anything short of 20% would make an impact on any major attribute of an area.I see one stat in the paper that &#34;40% of buildings had airbnb listings in some tracts&#34; but if the buildings had 10 units in them each this still may mean a relatively small number of total listings were from Airbnbs. In fact, even in Boston there are some tracts where I suppose that the average building must have 30+ units which would meant that if 60% of buildings had no listing the total percentage of listings that are Airbnbs is relatively small.&gt;higher levels of violent crime did not appear immediately after Airbnb listings became available to tourists, but rather developed over the course of several years, the researchers said.Alternative theory. Every area had some Airbnbs. In neighborhoods that were being wealthier/more popular/had more jobs decided it was easier to just do long-term rentals. In areas where landlords had trouble renting them out to anyone long-term (because locals know if a neighborhood is nice or not) they turned more units into Airbnbs because outsiders don&#39;t know/don&#39;t care."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Sigh. This appears to be one of those cases of media exaggeration for eyeballs. The study says:&gt; the effect on violence was only consistent visible for the measure of Airbnb penetration–or the extent to which buildings in the neighborhood have one or more listings (and for the measure of density, or the listings per household in the two-year lags). It was never present for overall usage, or the estimated quantity of Airbnb guestsAnd&gt; A second and related concern could be the potential bias due to omitted variables. Though the DID models control for the initial conditions of neighborhoods, they do not necessarily control for trends in these variables that parallel the increases in both Airbnb presence and crime. For example, there is some evidence that gentrifying neighborhoods experience increases in certain types of crimeAnd&gt; we have tested this hypothesis in a single citySo there&#39;s apparently a correlation between a single metric and a single class of crime in a single city, and there&#39;s a multi-year delay in the effect. The author speculates that erosion of social fabric is the culprit, but doesn&#39;t actually back this theory up with either data or references. One would at least expect some references to some other study about the correlations on emigration and violence (my two cents here is that it feels more likely that the former is caused by the latter, if a correlation exists at all). They even acknowledge that the correlation could be due to a factor that isn&#39;t being accounted for.But then the article writer drops all nuance and blasts a title pegging blame squarely on AirBnB, even though it isn&#39;t even established that correlation is consistently true everywhere, let alone causation.I mean, yeah, I get that people don&#39;t like predatory real estate renting, and want to hear that there&#39;s a neatly convenient evil entity to blame, but come on now."</p>

It&#39;s like they think it&#39;s 1995 and MeToo never happened.In the suit, the state even attempted a mediated resolution to prevent it from going to court. But Blizzard refused to cooperate, essentially taunting the state to bring a case, which they now have.It really makes you question whether Bobby Kotick is the right guy as CEO. Not only did he fail to demonstrate ethical leadership, but his handling of this crisis is massively destructive of shareholder value."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Blizzard&#39;s full response: &#34;The DFEH includes distorted, and in many cases false, descriptions of Blizzard’s past. We have been extremely cooperative with the DFEH throughout their investigation, including providing them with extensive data and ample documentation, but they refused to inform us what issues they perceived. They were required by law to adequately investigate and to have good faith discussions with us to better understand and to resolve any claims or concerns before going to litigation, but they failed to do so. Instead, they rushed to file an inaccurate complaint, as we will demonstrate in court. We are sickened by the reprehensible conduct of the DFEH to drag into the complaint the tragic suicide of an employee whose passing has no bearing whatsoever on this case and with no regard for her grieving family. While we find this behavior to be disgraceful and unprofessional, it is unfortunately an example of how they have conducted themselves throughout the course of their investigation. It is this type of irresponsible behavior from unaccountable State bureaucrats that are driving many of the State’s best businesses out of California.&#34;"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Story time!I grew up in eastern Europe in the communist era, in a country where entire factories were run using Commodore 64 computers that were smuggled in, bypassing export controls and sanctions.The programmer at one such factory was a friend of my father, and we&#39;d go over to his place for dinner semi-regularly. He didn&#39;t have kids, and I was six, so I was bored to tears. No toys and nobody my age to play with!He did have a C64, which was the only other one in town apart from the one at the factory. He was using it to practice programming after-hours at home. There were no games on it, but he did have a book of games.As in: a literal printed book of the source code for several simple games. That you were supposed to type in to be able to play!So I did. I had nothing else to do, so I whiled away the hours while the adults chatted poking away at the keyboard, typing in the BASIC code of the shortest, simplest game first.It didn&#39;t work at first. There were some errors. With help, I fixed the typos, and hey presto, the game worked! I still remember the elation, the feeling of accomplishment after all that work. I didn&#39;t even play the game for more than a minute or so, I immediately got to work on entering the next, longer game&#39;s code. I was hooked.Eventually I tried all three or four of the games in the book, and got bored. However, I was allowed to borrow the BASIC introductory problem set book, which I took back home with me to study. I solved the problems one at a time on grid paper (to match the fixed-width screen layout). I &#34;ran&#34; the programs in my head, debugged them by working out the variable values step by step on paper, and then tested my solutions on the real C64 computer whenever my parents went over for a social dinner. Most of my programs worked, and ran at ludicrous speed compared to the glacial pen &amp; paper solutions I had worked out. I instantly understood that Computers were levers for the mind. Learning to control that raw power was intoxicating.We fled across the iron curtain as political refugees, and I took that textbook with me. I had no access to computers for nearly a year, but when we finally got settled permanently in the West my dad bought a used C64 at a garage sale for a few dollars. This was a computer that back in my homeland would be the carefully guarded control hub of a factory. Here it was a discarded plaything. Even at that age, that blew my mind.I learned more programming languages in quick succession. Pascal at the age of 11, C and Assembly at 12, C++ at 13. I had written 3D engines by the time I went to University.Statistically, if you know programming, you probably learned it in a tertiary education setting, most likely in your late teens or early twenties. Just like learning a foreign language at that age, you&#39;ll never be perfectly fluent. You&#39;ll always have an accent, no matter what you do.To me, programming is my mother tongue. I&#39;m perfectly fluent and unaccented. You probably can&#39;t even tell, you can&#39;t hear the difference.Programming for you is something you do at work.I&#39;ve had dreams in C++"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The creator of this site made a really interesting video about the gravity fields in Super Mario Galaxy: https://youtu.be/QLH_0T_xv3IAmong other things I was surprised to learn that Mario&#39;s collision shape is a sphere rather than the more standard cylinder or capsule shape used for the player character in most games, which simplifies the physics when gravity changes direction. When you look at his character model the proportions make more sense once you know that they were designed to fill out a spherical shape. How many companies would change the character design of their most iconic franchise to make their physics engine simpler?"</p>

Perhaps 100 games, three pages of pics and two pages of commentary for each one. Feels like someone should document all these virtual worlds since  most people only have time to experience a few. Maybe it would work better as a wiki, or could start as such."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"TI is Telematik Infrastruktur. So TI-Messenger is just a messenger running on the VPN used for patient-data.It&#39;s good to see this happening. One of the biggest German healthcare contractors - famous for terrible code - had managed to creep their S/MIME demo implementation derivative code as a standard for secure communication in the healthcare world. With a MITM at each Kassenaerztliche Vereinigung(i.e. the people that represent the doctors and that charge ~2% per transaction for charging the public insurance companies). So it&#39;s unaudited &#34;E2E&#34; with a MITM by design. Given the complexity of this codebase, I do hope that they just use it unmodified.EDIT: one of the reasons why the KVs rolls/ed their own is because of inherent distrust between the physicians or the institution representing them and the governments health ministry getting that data. They believe that the government is incentivizing hospitals to take over physicians share of the cake. I wouldn&#39;t say that the distrust is misplaced, but unfortunately these crappy half baked own solutions born out of nepotism don&#39;t help their case."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I&#39;d be curious what a better alternative looks like.I&#39;m a huge fan of keeping things simple (vertically scaling 1 server with Docker Compose and scaling horizontally only when it&#39;s necessary) but having learned and used Kubernetes recently for a project I think it&#39;s pretty good.I haven&#39;t come across too many other tools that were so well thought out while also guiding you into how to break down the components of &#34;deploying&#34;.The idea of a pod, deployment, service, ingress, job, etc. are super well thought out and are flexible enough to let you deploy many types of things but the abstractions are good enough that you can also abstract away a ton of complexity once you&#39;ve learned the fundamentals.For example you can write about 15 lines of straight forward YAML configuration to deploy any type of stateless web app once you set up a decently tricked out Helm chart.. That&#39;s complete with running DB migrations in a sane way, updating public DNS records, SSL certs, CI / CD, having live-preview pull requests that get deployed to a sub-domain, zero downtime deployments and more."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"So the basic problem with *nix is its permission model.  If we had truly separable security/privilege/resource domains then Linux wouldn&#39;t have needed containers and simple processes and threads could have sufficed in place of Borg/docker/Kubernetes.There&#39;s a simpler and more powerful security model; capabilities.  Capabilities fix 90% of the problems with *nix.There&#39;s currently no simple resource model.  Everything is an ad-hoc human-driven heuristic for allocating resources to processes and threads, and is a really difficult problem to solve formally because it has to go beyond algorithmic complexity and care about the constant factors as well.The other *nix problem is &#34;files&#34;.  Files were a compromise between usability and precision but very few things are merely files.  Devices and sockets sure aren&#39;t.  There&#39;s a reason the &#39;file&#39; utility exists; nothing is really just a file.  Text files are actually text files + a context-free grammar (hopefully) and parser somewhere, or they&#39;re human-readable text (but probably with markup, so again a parser somewhere).Plenty of object models have come and gone; they haven&#39;t simplified computers (much less distributed computers), so we&#39;ll need some theory more powerful than anything we&#39;ve had in the past to express relationships between computation, storage, networks, and identities."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"As a Kubernetes outsider, I get confused why so much new jargon had to be introduced. As well as so many little new projects coupled to Kubernetes with varying degrees of interoperability. It makes it hard to get a grip on what Kube really is for newcomers.It also has all the hallmarks of a high-churn product where you need to piece together your solution from a variety of lower-quality information sources (tutorials, QA sites) rather than a single source of foolproof documentation."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I worked on engineering productivity research and measurement at Google for two years until about a month ago. (Opinions my own.) Compared to my former colleagues, I&#39;m an infant in this area, so take this with a heaping of salt.In general, I think the author&#39;s cynicism about productivity research is justified, but I think it could have been directed more productively. (NB: the following comments say nothing about areas of software engineering research outside of productivity.)Commercial software engineering is a creative endeavor; it is not a science, nor is it a manufacturing process. It does not have natural, universal laws. What makes a team &#39;productive&#39; varies massively based on constraints imposed by business model, product, customer expectations, leadership values, and of course the individuals of which it consists.I do not believe in the possibility of a &#34;General Theory of Productivity.&#34; I&#39;m highly skeptical of attempts to quantify the precise relationship between error discovery stage and cost in a way that is generalizable, although I think it might be possible given a large group of engineers using a highly homogenous process, tools, and accounting. Google is pretty close to this (common dev infrastructure across tens of thousands of engineers), and even across Google this kind of generalization would be extremely difficult.There is no universal physics of software engineering. As a result, academic research into productivity can be difficult to generalize (which is why, I think, you often see researchers twisting themselves into knots). Instead, my rec is to focus on a few key metrics that are aligned with your business&#39; or team&#39;s goals (search for DORA for a good starting set) and to reflect often on what you feel makes your team work well and what doesn&#39;t."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I was reading this thesis the other day[0], which is on precision machine design. It got me comparing precision machine design to  software engineering.A big part of why we&#39;re able to design extremely precise machines (the author worked on a lathe used for machining optical parts for the National Ignition Facility) is because we can characterize exactly where errors will come from (e.g. structure isn&#39;t rigid enough, temperature variation causes parts to expand by different amounts, parts not round or flat enough, etc.). Once we know what errors we need to control and their rough order of importance we can start improving the machine design to control them better.In theory, something similar could be done in software engineering (formal methods are part of this, but not a full solution). Rather than an error budget, you&#39;d have some sort of bug budget, where you tracked what sort of bugs were caused by what sort of constructs, and design your program in such a way to minimize their chance of being introduced. I&#39;ve never heard of anyone except Dan Bernstein[1] actually doing anything approximating this. Probably because the perceived level of effort is too high.I actually don&#39;t think it would take that much effort, but it would require quite a bit of organization to track where bugs are introduced and what their root causes are. This is probably why Bernstein, an individual, is able to do this, while no large team (that I&#39;m aware of) has done anything similar.Of course, just like your toaster doesn&#39;t need to use precision machine design techniques (an over-engineered toaster is a bad toaster), most software doesn&#39;t need the effort/expense of a rigorous design process either, but some would benefit from it.[0]: https://dspace.mit.edu/handle/1721.1/9414[1]: https://cr.yp.to/djb.html"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I went into this software engineering productivity research rabbit hole a decade ago and came away similarly depressed with the lack of rigor in our field.What I’ve come to believe:- Software engineering is not an engineering discipline, it is a craft. It may or may not one day become an engineering discipline, I find this impossible to tell.- The difference between a feature and a bug is largely one of semantics, not of substance. A defect is a mismatch between expected behavior and actual behavior. A bug is when the expectation was that of the programmer that wrote the code. A feature request is when the expectation was that of a user. There is no real difference for the user between a missing feature and a broken feature. Hence why we so often get side-tracked into fruitless “bug or feature” discussions and why users don’t care when we say it is by design.- Errors will happen. People are flawed and produce errors at a more or less set average rate for each person (unless they’re tired or enjoying a ballmer peak). Errors in every step of the process, from design to deployment, are inevitable. We can however catch these inevitable errors, with automated error detection tools, or by having a fresh set of eyes look at the work. The consequence is that making high quality software necessitates taking a look at the whole process and introducing error detection steps in every part of it, whether they be automated like linters and unit tests, or human like design and code review or mentoring and pair programming.- Errors in design are more costly because they cause entire features to need to be written or rewritten, which is the most costly kind of defect to resolve. We do not need research to know this to be true. We solve this by having short feedback loops with real users, which is the only real form of agile development."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"See the section titled “What the Magnuson-Moss Act Does Not Require” of the FTC’s “Businessperson’s Guide to Federal Warranty Law”[1] to understand why this is not even close to “enforcing right to repair”. Aside from the fact that the FTC can’t enforce a right to repair law that doesn’t exist, the promise to enforce the Magnuson-Moss Act doesn’t even scratch the surface of what right to repair aims to accomplish. For example, farmers who have famously campaigned for right to repair for years (decades?) aren’t covered by the Act because their equipment is for commercial, not consumer, use.Edit: Even though I think it’s beyond ridiculous to paint this as “right to repair” I am absolutely going to report Microsoft’s Xbox to the FTC for their egregious Magnuson-Moss violations. Maybe that stupid sticker will finally disappear.[1]https://www.ftc.gov/tips-advice/business-center/guidance/bus..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&#34;First, the Commission urges the public to submit complaints and provide other information to aid 
in greater enforcement of the Magnuson-Moss Warranty Act and its implementing regulations. 
While current law does not provide for civil penalties or redress, the Commission will consider 
filing suit against violators of the Magnuson-Moss Warranty Act to seek appropriate injunctive 
relief.&#34;&#34;Second, the Commission will scrutinize repair restrictions for violations of the antitrust laws. For 
example, certain repair restrictions may constitute tying arrangements or monopolistic 
practices—such as refusals to deal, exclusive dealing, or exclusionary design—that violate the 
Sherman Act.8 Violations of the Sherman Act also violate the prohibition on unfair methods of 
competition codified in Section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act. &#34;We&#39;ve had these laws on the books for a long time. I&#39;m not confident that they&#39;re going to be effectively applied, unless the FTC has significantly increased in size and capability recently."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I bombed an interview at a game company because I gave a right answer that I couldn&#39;t get them to understand.I don&#39;t remember the exact problem they wanted me to solve, but the answer involved a dynamic collection and they wanted it to grow with constant time complexity. They were probably looking for a linked list. But I said I&#39;d use a dynamic array because those have constant time when averaged over a series of appends.I don&#39;t know if I remembered the term &#34;amortized complexity&#34; or not, but it was clear that they had never heard of doing amortized analysis across a series of operations and they absolutely did not get my answer. They got hung up on the idea that some appends force the array to grow and get copied. I tried to explain that that was only true for a predictable fraction of them, but they were stuck on the idea that this meant dynamic arrays had O(n) worst case performance. They clearly thought I didn&#39;t know what the hell I was talking about.I&#39;m pretty sure that was the point where they decided to pass on me.But now I&#39;m a senior software engineer at Google and I just finished writing a textbook that explains dynamic arrays including their amortized analysis, so joke&#39;s on them."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Can&#39;t really comment on whether that was the correct way to handle the situation, given that passing the interview was the goal. However, I would have a hard time giving an incorrect answer on purpose. I also consider an interview as an opportunity to learn about the company I&#39;m going to work for, and especially my future colleagues.I would probably try to give a full answer, such as &#34;there&#39;s a widely-held concept X, but my understanding is that this is not completely correct, and in fact a better model is Y.&#34; A technical lead that can&#39;t work with an answer like that is one I probably don&#39;t want to work with."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"There&#39;s not a lot of context given about the behaviors exhibited in this interview, but as many others here have said, red flags abound in this anecdote.&gt; But the problem was, that this guys manager was sitting next to him. If he didn’t know, I would totally humiliate him in front of his boss. So either he would stick to his guns and refuse the correctness of my answer, to save face. Or he needed to agree that he was wrong, and lose face.I would love to ask the author if their team lead ever confirmed these suspicions. I would doubt it, but happy to amend my position if wrong. Regardless, to me this sounds like the exact type of culture I wouldn&#39;t want a new hire bringing in. I don&#39;t need to be managed or protected, especially from my own manager. I need honest answers, not what I want to hear. I wasn&#39;t in the room, I can&#39;t read the vibes like the author did, but I&#39;ll consider the omissions here telling-- there&#39;s no description of an anxious or frazzled team lead, or an imperious manager peering down. It seems like the only thing the author saved the team lead from were problems in their own head."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The other peril of M1 ownership is the lack of alternative operating systems. The other way I reinstalled an older Macbook through &#34;internet recovery&#34; and it downloaded the version it was originally shipped with - macOS Mojave.The UI was a breath of fresh air compared to Big Sur. Despite the screen being smaller than my M1 the information density was higher and it felt more like a tool than a toy. The lack of bullshit apps such as Apple TV, News &amp; co and useless &#34;widgets&#34; was also good (for all of iTunes&#39; flaws, it&#39;s still better than its modern successors), and it somehow felt faster despite being less than half the processing power of the M1.I now wish I could run this on my M1 but alas I can&#39;t. At least with PCs and older Macs you could always switch to Windows or Linux, but with the M1 you&#39;re currently screwed - if Apple drops the ball or decides to take their OS in a direction you don&#39;t like you currently have no alternative (and all the &#34;security&#34; around locking out the user from their own machine doesn&#39;t bode well for alternative OSes)."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Wow I&#39;m so happy I&#39;m moving away from Mac administration. I currently manage a big userbase but we still don&#39;t have M1s in our environment as our antivirus solution (Cylance) is really slow in supporting it.Apple is introducing more and more mechanisms in the name of security but they keep access and information very close to their heart. All us Mac admins have struggled with SecureToken in combination with AD accounts and it took two major releases for Apple to actually introduce a way for us to manage these properly through MDM. In the mean time most information had to be gathered through blogs such as this one.Another issue is that more and more enterprise management features are becoming dependent on managed (federated) Apple IDs. But Apple requires that the email and identifying account address (UPN) are the same which will never happen in our 200k user environment. So we&#39;re stuck with more and more things to work around.This is really something that should have been considered from the start. And this owner key thing sounds worse. Security is good but the end user or corporate admin should have the keys to every lock. Not just the vendor. Now my successor can deal with this stuff.I used to be a big fan of macOS personally too but I moved over to FreeBSD 2 years ago and I&#39;m glad I did. I really want an OS that answers to me."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"It seems like these changes have good intentions (i.e. improved security), but introduce a lot of complexity that can have unintended consequences for end-users. This reminds me somewhat of my process setting up UEFI Secure Boot on my Windows PC that wasn&#39;t originally configured for it. Not in the exact steps, but in that there is a ton going on behind the scenes and the UX is horrendously bad.Unfortunately, vendors haven&#39;t really thought about how to explain these changes to end-users. They are trying to make them fairly transparent, which probably works at least 95% of the time, but for a small percentage of people, becomes a big PITA."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Fire up the throwaway!Not 100% related to the article, but directly related.I worked as developer for a product in the same niche (&#34;democratizing adult content&#34;). I spent almost 2 years working on the frontend, devops, and building out the  analytics engine (all pre-covid).Anyway, on to the comment at hand.We had a small number of users compared to OnlyFans (when I left, there were about 20K active content creators). The average monthly payment was $5000 (skewed massively by the top 5%).We had phone support for our larger creator. One very common request was to instantly delete all data and stop processing future orders. Usually, the requester was in a pretty agitated/distraught state (I&#39;d occasionally get escalated calls to &#34;confirm&#34; that all data would be deleted ASAP and no copies would be kept).I spoke to a few of our creators and most would be desperate to scrub all of their content form the internet because:a) A parent/relative found out.b) A fellow employee at their 9-5 stumbled on their account.c) A &#39;fan&#39; went nuclear and was waging all out digital war. One creator had a former subscriber sending data dumps to all their Facebook and Instagram friends (they also spammed every public email address at their &#39;normal&#39; workplace, which was a local government).We would occasionally get demanding letters requesting the removal of content from third party sites (Pornhub, Reddit, etc). The creators would somehow be surprised when they realised we couldn&#39;t remove content from other websites.The experience was very depressing."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"So our kids are getting older so I&#39;ve been paying more attention to popular social networks and it&#39;s wild how many YouTubers, Twitch&#39;ers, TikTok&#39;ers, Instagram&#39;ers have OF content directly linked from their non-porn bios.I don&#39;t like it, but I&#39;m not sure what a good solution is. I mean, people are free to do what they&#39;d like, but it&#39;s hard to police screen time 100% of the time and their peer group has a lot more access than they do so even if I can block it 100$ they&#39;ll be exposed to it somewhere else. We&#39;ve talked about it and I feel like that&#39;s all I can do now. I just hate how normalized it feels when many of their social media &#34;role models&#39; turn to porn."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I’m not anti-sex or anti-sex work, but I think onlyfans is evil.  They have a business model, that is perfected to extract as much money from whales as possible.  Performers appear to have ‘relationships’ with their subscribers, encourage them to tip, buy ‘customs’, and ‘engage’ with them.These sad lonely sexless men spend all their money on this shit.  It consumes them, until they are out of money, then it destroys them.  It warps their expectations of relationships further impacting their datability, driving them even more towards onlyfans.Now, this is only a minority of their users, but makes a large proportion of their revenue.  For healthy people, only fans can be great."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"In 2019 I filed my (Dutch) taxes on my phone, while I was on a bus somewhere in the north of Argentina after previously having traveled for 20 something hours. It took me about 15 minutes to check if the numbers from the government were correct (they were) and I was done. Americans are being duped by these predatory companies."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"TurboTax recently tricked me using some dark UI patterns into spending 30+ minutes painstakingly filling out my tax forms in a way that made it seem like it was for the free filing.Only at the very end, did they reveal that it was in fact for the paid version, with no way to change it to the free version and also keep the work. Essentially holding my work hostage.So I had to redo it again in the hard-to-find free version. I am now anti-TurboTax for life."</p>

Too bad our political system is still under his thumb and doesn&#39;t shed light on this crap even now that he&#39;s no longer PM."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"If there is one single lasting international effect of Orbán and his party, it&#39;s how he demonstrated how EU is completely helpless against rouge states (as well). The delicate political balance of its parliamental politics make it impossible to react to any complex, even if lethal threats. The EU funds and fuels a Belorussian-style regime in its own heartland for a decade now, and all they can do are angry notices and legal disputes that take years without a noteworthy resolution. Due to how alliances within the union work - Hungary has the full support of Poland and the V4 - any major blowback would result in shattering itself."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"So far Orban&#39;s regime is the only eu/western government involved in this scandal. I see that no surprise.There is no need of official government approval to conduct such surveillance. It&#39;s enough to have weak access contol to such technologies, political roles within the agencies, and poor work ethics in civil servants: there alway will be someone with will and motive to act in favor of the system, off the record. Orban deliberately shaped the government this way."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"While this list looks solid, I think it&#39;s telling that none of the papers that immediately came to my mind were on this list.I suspect that there are many more, and which papers are important to any one person is as varied as the disciplines we have within software engineering.- Out of the Tar Pit 2005, a paper on Functional Reactive Programming that is an excellent read for anyone doing functional programming, UI programming, or a number of other things.- Consistent Hashing and Random Trees: Distributed Caching Protocols for Relieving Hot Spots on the World Wide Web 1997, important read for anyone working in distributed systems or services with any sort of scale.- Roy Fielding&#39;s dissertation 2000, to learn just how widely applicable REST principles are and how misunderstood it is as a design.- The Part Time Parliament 1998, the original Paxos paper, important basis for anyone working with distributed systems.- The Cathedral and the Bazaar 1997, an essay not a paper, but a good background to the open source world."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Like most of these types of articles, it seems to me, to be biased towards a certain genre of development. I don&#39;t know how often I encounter a lot of the stuff the author seems to consider &#34;fundamentals.&#34;I have spent a good part of my life doing things like device control, and direct, native, user interface. These can get mui hairy.It&#39;s difficult to talk to a lot of folks about these, as everyone is focused on &#34;the Big Picture,&#34; to quote Peter O&#39;Toole.Device control, in particular, has a lot of aspects that are unique, and not particularly applicable to many other disciplines. With the advent of some of the new communication techs, like Bluetooth, and advanced serial buses (like USB and Thunderbolt), we&#39;re starting to see a bit of cross-pollination with communications (another discipline that many software developers never need to worry about).UI has always been best served (not exclusive, but best), as native. This means that each platform tends to have a specific framework.Learning frameworks, SDKs, and APIs has always (for me) been the most time-consuming part of adapting to a platform or system.But that&#39;s just me. YMMV."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"A few papers that changed my life were the ones about distributed, no sql databases (cassandra, consistent hashing, dynamodb, map reduce, etc). But I would not recommend them to anybody else, I was just useful to me as at the time. I was a CS student in Argentina, studying in a very old fashioned university. The coding exams were done ON PAPER in a Pascal-flavored pseudo code.When I found and started reading those papers it was like finding life in another planet. It completely changed my way of thinking. I dropped out school and focused on learning as much of the cool stuff as possible (on the internet). It payed off well :)"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Since this is a long article, here’s a summary for fellow readers — it’s mostly about the negative side effects of meditation that the author believes is under-documented or under-reported due to the ‘hype’ of meditation as the 21st century cure-all. He talks about dissociative experiences (which is well documented in medical research), it being a pseudo-religion, and lastly, his belief that the extended use of meditation is the ‘opposite’ of stoicism in the way that it can render a person not less, but more susceptible to breakage from smaller stresses, like one of a traffic jam. He also attempts to make a biological argument on how this works by invoking something he calls the limbic system feedback loop, however I have found that argument unconvincing due to lack of any actual evidence."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; This terrain was fresh. I had never previously experienced a psychotic episode and have no history of mental illness besides occasional bouts of mild anxiety and depression.
...
&gt; Why did I start meditating? The short answer is that in 2009 I started a fist fight in a French Quarter bar over some jambalaya, a steamy kiss, and a stray comment I didn’t take fondly. The evening ended hours later after I broke a window with my fist, misplaced my shirt, and guzzled about 16 bottles of Miller High Life.YYMMV, but I feel the author is having problems they dont want to really accept.  That is what the contradiction in the two quotes above indicates.Aside from that, I couldn&#39;t help but think about people having access to too many psychedelics.  For a while, tripping can give you the most profound experiences ever.  But after a while, it sort of becomes mondane, and this is when the bad trip probability suddenly skyrockets.  Or, put another way, even Siddhartha didn&#39;t find awakening in the samana practices.  They were only the first step (of three) to reach his goal.  You can overdo everything, even the very very nice things."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Ha! I thought it might have been vipassana.  My own experience of this (a 10 day silent retreat, not having done meditation before) was a full blown manic-psychotic experience (never having had any such thing before, nor in family history). If you&#39;re interested, I made some audio files [0] talking about what happened.I honestly think it&#39;s _insane_ that they (vipassana) will take regular people who haven&#39;t done meditation and allow them to do a 10 day silent retreat. I honestly think it&#39;s like taking a regular person and allowing them to go down a grade 4 or 5 river. They might make it, but they might get seriously hurt too.I actually raised this point with the local (New Zealand) health and disability ombudsman. I said that vipassana ought to have a psychologist to assess people as they left, or at least _something_ like that. Nothing changed as far as I am aware.I hope the author continues to get better. It was a long journey for me.[0]. http://livingvipassana.blogspot.com/2010/02/bipolar-chronicl..."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"One thing that many people (including myself at times) are prone to is an irrational fear that their idea will be stolen. This wouldn’t be such a big deal if this fear didn’t cause people to repeatedly shoot themselves in the foot. Countless ideas never got off the ground because the innovator refused to talk to investors or partners without an NDA or withheld important details.By far the biggest risk to any idea is that it never gets off the ground. It’s orders of magnitude more likely that you’ll get a zero outcome than anything else. Zero users. Zero adoption. Zero product.For anyone in this position, you’d be better off if the idea was stolen. Because at least you’ll be known as the original version of the thing that big tech ripped off. That’s almost certainly good for a few percent market share. Which is way better than zero."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; Imagine if your spouse told you, “I have an idea for a delicious 10-course meal. You should spend the next few days researching each dish, buying the ingredients, testing different versions, preparing the final meal, and serving it plate by plate at a dinner party. We’ll split the credit 50/50.”This is brilliant. I am going to use this next time someone tells me they want to give me equity for building their entire product."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; Many of them want a partner–they’ll be in charge of the idea, and I’ll execute it.Boy, does that sound familiar. In my experience, they&#39;ll also get most of the money and credit, and will plan to kick me to the curb, once it gets to alpha.&gt; I hate to break it to you, but your idea–any idea, really–is worthless. An idea only has value when it is executed, and it only has a lot of value when it’s executed well.And that &#34;executed well&#34; is important. I have seen so many promising ideas and systems destroyed by being written by &#34;lowest common denominator&#34; implementation talent."</p>

It&#39;s a free museum with a great restaurant, cool exhibits, a nice park across the street. Nearby is The Book Thing, a free book store. Also another (non-free) book &amp; record store, Normal&#39;s. And another, Urban Reads. And another bookstore/coffee shop, Bird in Hand. And a farmer&#39;s market. And a vegan restaurant. And the quirkiest diner ever, Papermoon. And a small rock venue. And a worker-owned co-op coffeeshop that President Obama visited. All in a four block radius.Dang, I miss Baltimore."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Also notable is the Broad Museum in Los Angeles. Their guards are also docents, so you are encouraged to talk to them about the art and ask them questions. After experiencing this more human interaction, it was a bit of a shock for me to go down the street to the Museum of Contemporary Art, where I asked a guard a question and they flat out rejected my asking, haha!Arts workers need to be paid well and also have enriching roles in the museums. And I don&#39;t think this sort of thing necessarily requires a 4-year degree or whatnot. I believe people are naturally curious, and we need to lean into that."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is peculiar because it treats security guards as humans and challenges unspoken hierarchy. It also implies the museum doesn&#39;t save on security (17 guards is a lot) and there isn&#39;t a big turnover (unless there&#39;s a special type of security guard that mostly works in museums). It&#39;s borderline unthinkable in the 5th roundest country in the world where I live. They would hire students.I was hoping it would be more about burglaries, stealing famous works of arts, selling stolen works etc. The law enforcement / security perspective. Instead it appears to be a pretty standard exhibition except with an unusual method of selecting curators."</p>

Watch and skim a bunch of videos at 2x speed around the idea of the thing (usually keynotes or videos created by the author) to get hyped up3. Go through the documentation&#39;s getting started guide while following along4. Immediately start building something with the new thingTreat everything beyond this as question driven development[0] or basically JIT (just in time) learning.For context the first 3 steps are usually no more than a weekend or a few days.I do this loop all the time and it hasn&#39;t really failed yet for learning all sorts of things (5+ programming languages, a bunch of stuff about Linux, Ansible, Docker, Vim, Terraform, Kubernetes, video production, and the list goes on). These are learning things very quickly at a level where you can comfortably bill out freelance work or get employed.[0]: https://nickjanetakis.com/blog/learning-a-new-web-framework-..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; If you only follow guided resources, you&#39;ll wind up in tutorial hell.I disagree very strongly here. You can wind up in tutorial hell if you only read surface level small to medium sized posts.My &#34;career superpower&#34; is that I&#39;m always working my way through one textbook or another. You get serious depth this way and avoid getting stuck with a surface level understanding. Plus, with depth you can end up with really strong fundamentals, which make learning the next thing that much easier.I know a lot of people who read tons of blog posts on topics but never crack open a textbook, or people who watch youtubers explain academic papers yet never open up the actual paper.Maybe my &#34;learn stuff quickly&#34; trick is... don&#39;t. Spend a decade accumulating deep knowledge slowly, and it&#39;ll add up. The road to &#34;tutorial hell&#34; is paved with blogposts and missing fundamentals.(I like the rest of the post)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&#34;With software development, though, mistakes are free! If we make a mistake, we can tab back to our editor, change the code, and try again. We even have helpful error messages that can (sometimes) point us in the right direction. This is an incredible luxury, and not one that we take advantage of enough.&#34;This is definitely very underrated and partly why I think computer science education is still sort of broken in some universities. Trial and error should be embraced as a a part of the process of building things. But instead, many curriculums in universities use exams to test your knowledge without any sort of debugger or console. You just have to go off of what you know, getting things as close to correct as you can in the first pass.All evaluations in CS should surround some type of project based work, it&#39;s a huge luxury other fields don&#39;t have. Students studying architecture or mechanical engineering, for example, simply can&#39;t build a functioning bridge as a test due to the cost of raw materials and how fatal an error may be (that would be really cool though). It&#39;s an advantage that we literally can build the bridge equivalent as a project in the CS world."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The restaurant industry has known the solution for a long time but everyone wants to pretend it would be too difficult.Stop the tipping guilt trip placed on the public, raise your prices 20%, and pay your employees a livable wage. The public will still show up to eat in your restaurant."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I think some businesses are going out of businesses because they stubbornly refuse to raise their wages.In the vacation community where I live, there are two grocery/delis about a mile apart from each other. One is at a marina, the other is at a beach. They have almost the same business offering. Traditionally, both are fully mobbed during the sunny seasons.Two weeks ago, I visited the one I usually go to -- at the marina. They had a sign at the front door, &#34;Due to the labor shortage...&#34; and they weren&#39;t operating their deli counter. No sandwiches. When I sent inside, it was empty. No customers. The one employee at the register was on their phone. Nothing going on. A couple of people pulled up in their cars, read the sign, pulled out and left immediately.Drove up the road a mile to the other one. No sign -- it was busy like it usually was. Full house, busy counters and registers.My son asked me why the other place wouldn&#39;t just raise their wages.. I couldn&#39;t answer, but I guessed it was more on a matter of principle than calculated reality. There&#39;s no way they were surviving or thriving. I joked that maybe the owner was an old cahoot who remembered when a soda was $0.05 and there was no way they were going to raise their hourly wages to $15 or more."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Wages/insurance/tips are an ongoing concern of food service work, but I want to set that aside and talk about the other half of the article. Customer entitlement is out of control and anybody who works with the general public will tell you it’s gotten even worse since the pandemic—and it wasn’t trending in the right direction before. Flight attendants, park rangers, government clerks, the anecdotes are everywhere, in whispers and on social media.A good friend of mine is a doctor and he has a hair-raising story for me nearly every day, often indistinguishable from fast food customers’ behavior. I’m trying to get him to retire before he gets shot by somebody who was told they’d have to wait 3 days for an appointment.What’s going on?  I have my own theories but I want HN’s take."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Just the other day I suggested using a yubikey, and someone linked me to the Titan sidechannel where researchers demonstrated that, with persistent access, and a dozen hours of work, they could break the guarantees of a Titan chip[0]. They said &#34;an attacker will just steal it&#34;. The researchers, on the other hand, stressed how very fundamentally difficult this was to pull off due to very limited attack surface.This is the sort of absolutism that is so pointless.At the same time, what&#39;s equally frustrating to me is defense without a threat model. &#34;We&#39;ll randomize this value so it&#39;s harder to guess&#34; without asking who&#39;s guessing, how often they can guess, how you&#39;ll randomize it, how you&#39;ll keep it a secret, etc. &#34;Defense in depth&#34; has become a nonsense term.The use of memory unsafe languages for parsing untrusted input is just wild. I&#39;m glad that I&#39;m working in a time where I can build all of my parsers and attack surface in Rust and just think way, way less about this.I&#39;ll also link this talk[1], for the millionth time.

								<p class="story__comment_others">"The article says that although &#34;you can&#39;t have perfect security,&#34; you can make it uneconomical to hack you. It&#39;s a good point, but it&#39;s not the whole story.The problem is that state-level actors don&#39;t just have a lot of money; they (and their decision makers) also put a much much lower value on their money than you do.I would never think to spend a million dollars on securing my home network (including other non-dollar costs like inconveniencing myself). Let&#39;s suppose that spending $1M would force the US NSA to spend $10M to hack into my home network. The people making that decision aren&#39;t spending $10M of their own money; they&#39;re spending $10M of the government&#39;s money. The NSA doesn&#39;t care about $10M in the same way that I care about $1M.As a result, securing yourself even against a dedicated attacker like Israel&#39;s NSO Group could cost way, way more than a simple budget analysis would imply. I&#39;d have to make the costs of hacking me so high that someone at NSO would say &#34;wait a minute, even we can&#39;t afford that!&#34;So, sure, &#34;good enough&#34; security is possible in principle, I think it&#39;s fair to say &#34;You probably can&#39;t afford good-enough security against state-level actors.&#34;"</p>

You can plug the hole for a normal filesystem, but then FUSE filesystems have an additional problem: &#34;if an attacker FUSE-mounts a long directory (longer than 8MB), then systemd exhausts its stack, crashes, and therefore crashes the entire operating system (a kernel panic).&#34;If there&#39;s one place other than the kernel where truly defensive programming should be applied, it is systemd."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"This kind of issue is the reason why some more modern languages like Rust or Go do not have implicit narrowing conversions. For instance, on Rust, trying to simply pass an usize (Rust&#39;s equivalent of size_t) to a function which expects an i32 (Rust&#39;s equivalent of int) will not compile; the programmer has to write &#34;size as i32&#34; (Rust&#39;s equivalent of &#34;(int) size&#34;), which makes it explicit that it might truncate the value at that point.(Some Rust developers argue that even &#34;size as i32&#34; should be avoided, and &#34;size.try_into()&#34; should be used instead, since it forces the programmer to treat an overflow explicitly at runtime, instead of silently wrapping.)"</p>

Most people will agree that mass-surveillance will negatively affect some people that are indispensable to healthily functioning liberal society: journalists, activists, academics, public figures...The problem is that even if most people don&#39;t subscribe to the &#34;nothing to hide&#34; argument in general, they do not care about themselves being the target of surveillance.Having unsuccessfully tried to make family and acquaintances more aware of privacy issue, I can confidently say that the &#34;nothing to hide&#34; argument is nothing next to the &#34;I don&#39;t care&#34; attitude. It&#39;s not just being the target of a wrongful accusation, arguments about unintended public shaming, identity theft, negative economic consequences (higher insurance premium or mortgage rates if your bank has more information about you), none of it will work.I think there is some sort of a Tverskyan study to be done here about expected value and perceived risk.

								<p class="story__comment_others">"It&#39;s a fight we are only ever gonna lose.I.e. in Germany, I have seen wave after wave of surveillance passed. People try to fight back each time. Often the supreme court cancels the unconstitutional laws.But they always try again. And it only takes a football euro cup or Worldcup, or Olympic games or a natural catastrophy to provide the distraction for the public to pass another law.Our governments want to surveil us, and they will do it whether we like it or not.People only stand up and fight if the damage if the fight is smaller than the damage of what they are fighting against. We live comfortable, so we will take a lot of this type of immoral behaviour of our leaders. The figth will only start after enough innocent surveillance victims are harmed in the real world (i.e. their data is leaked or worse) and enough people have felt negative consequences of this surveillance."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I think the fight against mass surveillance needs first to be lost in order to even start. Right now the average citizen has not witnessed an impact on his life and there&#39;s no shortage of other problems he has to deal with.I&#39;m not saying techies should just stay passive though. Special cases - journalists, activists, politically involved - need to be protected right now, and when the problem will be generally understood we need to have solutions ready for the average person: information, software, proposed legislation, etc."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"If I understand the story correctly, they had the suspect in custody and yet failed to positively ID him, relying on an ID he had stolen from an innocent man named Ousmane Bah.  The ID had no photo and was labeled &#34;not to be used for identification&#34;.  SIS filed a police report which said they had video evidence showing the perpetrator.They then put out a &#34;BOLO&#34; with the innocent man&#39;s name, had him arrested, figured out they have the wrong guy, do nothing about it and had him arrested again.When Bah appeared in court to answer charges and Apple was asked to present the video that would have cleared Bah, Apple claimed that the video had been deleted.  The video was later found by Bah&#39;s attorney during discovery.  This happened more than once.  A warrant was issued for Bah’s arrest and contained the photo of the imposter.  Bah was arrested even though the he doesn&#39;t resemble the imposter, other than being Black.  Prosecution against Bah continued in multiple states through June 2019.Hmmm, seems like a lot of people involved in this case should be fired, including the Apple Employees, SIS Employees and Police officers, reguardless of whatever other outcomes there are."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt;Apple then told the Suffolk County prosecutor &#34;that the video evidence of the impostor, which would have completely exculpated Ousmane Bah, had been routinely deleted.&#34;Why would anyone routinely delete evidence of crime instead of making a copy of it before it was deleted? What&#39;s the point of having surveillance equipment and footage if it&#39;s just routinely deleted even if there was a theft?&gt;The video from an October 2018 theft misattributed to Bah in Rockaway, New Jersey, was also deleted.Oh wow, again?&gt;And as it turned out, the video of the Boston incident turned up eventually – Bah&#39;s attorneys found it during the discovery process. It showed the impostor, not Bah.They should open a criminal investigation into what happened with the video. Intentionally accusing someone they know to be innocent, taking their time and freedom is completely inexcusable."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt;identified the individual as Ousmane Bah based on the examination of the temporary learner&#39;s permit he is said to have had on himSo essentially a kid stole another kids ID. Because the (thieving) kid had gotten in trouble with the same ID before it was also a match in the database.It does seem like a true failure but the headline makes it sound like this was an AI falsely accusing someone based on pure randomness. Even without the tech, the police would have had the name of the wrongly accused person because the security guard only had the fake/wrong ID and the person&#39;s ability to match faces was not great."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I recently had the privilege of trying to do the right thing when I identified fraudulent research carried out by an institution in Austria. The initial response of the institution was positive but when I pressed for further details on how such things could happen suddenly nobody anymore would take my call. The research was paid for by a private company to pimp a nonsense product. The research was never published in a research journal but it didn&#39;t stop the company using the name of the university alonside exerpts from the paper in marketing material alongside gushing claims of &#34;proved by science&#34;.The company threatened to sue me and the university threatened me as well. Neither has followed through on threats. The company wants to keep selling their rubbish magnetic health ding ding and I assume the university wants nobody to look into how positive results for the product came out of their institution. Allround an education on how the real world works."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"When you want to do a proper work, your grants and papers get rejected because they are not innovatove enough or don&#39;t go far enough. So it is not a surprise that people that lied in their applications about what they can realistically do also lie when it comes to reporting results. Unfortunately there is no way out. I stopped counting how many reviewers of my grants disagreed on what was proposed, one saying that it was not innovative, the other saying that is was too risky to use this approach. We have a big problem in science, peer-review is broken and everything relies on it. And many reviewers are way out of touch about what happens in their field, I see reviews that clearly show the reviewer was sleeping for the last 10 years."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"What I want to know is how does this issue impact the notion that we all seem to buy into that we should &#34;follow the science&#34;.Scientists themselves have a hard time &#34;following the science&#34;. Add to it the observation that when an issue is getting lots of attention outside of academia, then there are usually some really strong incentives (profit, prestige) associated with doing the science and applying it (e.g., epidemiological science during a global pandemic).The question seems not to be about how can normal people &#34;follow the science&#34; but rather, why should normal people trust at all that any touted science is anything more than bullshit spouted by highly-motivated sophists?"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"In a sea of cynicism, I gotta say.. bravo. This genuinely put a smile on my face. It has a lot of problems, sure, but it&#39;s a creative use of the Web and would surely work for some use cases. It&#39;s certainly no worse than using Flash ever was.It reminds me a bit of a &#34;newsletter&#34; I&#39;m subscribed to called, ironically, &#34;Not a Newsletter&#34; (http://notanewsletter.com/). You get an email from the author each month and it just points to a Google Doc where he puts the actual content. Why&#39;s this good? The content can&#39;t set off any spam filters, he can edit the issue after it&#39;s &#34;sent&#34; if there are mistakes or broken links.."</p>

I cannot do that.Realistically, how many years will I have to wait until Firefox catches up?Over twenty years ago, I learnt Web authoring by examining the source which had a profound effect on my career. That serendipitous opportunity I had with human-readable sources will be lost to the next generation with PDF - they have to learn the technology deliberately."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Curious to see comments quipping that some of the math problems geared towards young kids are too hard. I&#39;d recommend taking a look at Singapore Math[0] to get an idea of what kids in those age ranges are actually capable of doing, provided that adults shed preconceptions that children ought to be &#34;sheltered from hard scary stuff&#34;, and instead encourage them.There are also great math-oriented games these days (I had some good success w/ prodigygame.com[1]).My youngest daughter is 6 and can solve simple multiplication and division problems. Sometimes she even surprises me. Some time ago, we were introducing ourselves to a new neighbor and the convo went somewhat along these lines:- my son: how old is your dog?- neighbor: she&#39;s 8- son: she&#39;s so small, is she a puppy?- neighbor: oh no, she&#39;s grown up. 1 dog year is about 7 human years, so-- daughter [interrupting]: oh wow, so then she is 56!The other day, she came to me beaming to explain how she had just solved 38/2 (by doing 40/2, 2/2 and subtracting the results). Gotta say it&#39;s a joy to see a kid that enjoys math.[0] https://www.singaporemath.com/[1] https://www.prodigygame.com/main-en/"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"On a related subject, here is a recent experience and I dont know how to deal with it.I have been helping my kids with their homework during the pandemic, I thought it would be easy since I got very good grade 25+ years ago. And then when I sat down doing it. I couldn&#39;t remember a thing. Not a single thing. All of a sudden, apart from basic algebra, all of the maths were gone. Zip, Zero. I couldn&#39;t remember how sin cos tan works any more. It was like a few years of memory in my brain went missing. For some people it may be funny and have a laugh about it. For me it was shocking, quite horrifying and depressing.I am thinking if I should relearn all those maths again. If so how do you go about it? Most of my friends aren&#39;t any good at maths so they thought not remembering any thing was not a problem.But for some strange reason all the basic for Physics, Chemistry and Biology were still there. At least half of it. It was just maths. I dont know if anyone else have similar experience."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"They&#39;re interesting to adults, too! Simple enough that it feels like you should be able to blurt out the answer, I&#39;m more than twice the maximum recommended age and a professional engineer, but (at least for me) it takes some thought. The top recommended three:&gt; 1. Masha  was seven  kopecks  short  to  buy  a  first  reading  book, and  Mishalacked one kopeck.  They combined their money to buy one book to share, but even then they did not have enough.  How much did the book cost?&gt; 3. A  brick  weighs  one  pound  and  half  the  brick.   How  many  pounds  does the brick weigh?&gt; 13. Two  volumes  of  Pushkin,  the  first  and  the  second,  are  side-by-side  on a bookshelf.  The pages of each volume are 2 cm thick, and the cover – front and back each – is 2 mm.  A bookworm has gnawed through (perpendicular to the pages) from the first page of volume 1 to the last page of volume 2.  How long is the bookworm’s track?I do take objection to the answer to question 13 - the author seems particularly set on one way of loading the bookshelves as correct."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"My shield updated to this the other day. I&#39;m pretty furious about it, it&#39;s not a cheap device, and it&#39;s certainly not Google&#39;s. To be adding these &#34;features&#34; without asking, irrespective of whatever agreement between me, Nvidia or Google exists, is ridiculous.I know it&#39;s in whatever terms I, uh, &#34;accepted&#34;, but there&#39;s just no escaping it in this day and age.Fortunately, I know how to use ADB and just installed another launcher, but most other people just have to bend over and take it. No doubt ADB tricks won&#39;t be sufficient in future updates and I&#39;ll be playing more silly games with a device I own.Apple is seems almost as bad too. There&#39;s recommendations that I don&#39;t want. It&#39;s certainly worse in that I would have even less control and be unable to remove them.It&#39;s certainly a good thing that I don&#39;t live anywhere near a Google office, otherwise I&#39;d be launching this POS through one of their windows if I did."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;ve had the Shield for years and set them up for a few family members. I still believe it&#39;s the best device of its kind on the market and I&#39;ve recommended it every chance so I have a lot of friends with them as well.In the most recent update, the until-now ad-free homepage was defaced with an ad banner that takes up half the screen and can&#39;t be removed. This wasn&#39;t a change made by Nvidia but by Google to the Android TV Launcher. To add to this, some of the ads have been deemed inappropriate or offensive to certain users adding to the frustration of ads being introduced to this long-standing ad-free experience.I, like many Shield owners, am considering installing a third party launcher. This can be done pretty easily by watching an instruction video on Youtube and most users will go this route without consideration of security - potentially opening large numbers of the devices up to vulnerabilities."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&#34;Test your backups&#34; is so easy to say, but quite difficult for many to do. There are a lot of shops that probably don&#39;t know how to recreate a machine from scratch. How many systems are developed as balls of clay. Little bits added and smeared in over time until the ball just gets bigger, but each piece lost in the process. How many folks can go through their local config files and explain all of entries, how many can even tell which ones they have changed, or why? Especially when they were changed by Frank, but he left 2 years ago.You&#39;d like to think you can just restore the system from backup and it&#39;ll just light back up. But how do you test this without cratering your existing system? Like a boat in a basement, many system are built in-situ and can be very rigid.Modern environments like cloud computing and creation scripts can mitigate this a bit organically, but how many of these systems are just a tower running Windows w/SQL Server and who knows what else? Plus whatever client software is on the client machines.How do you test that in isolation?At least read the media to see if it can be read (who doesn&#39;t love watching a backup tape fail halfway through the restore).Simply, it takes a lot of engineering to make a system that can be reliably restored, much less on a frequent basis. And this is all engineering that doesn&#39;t impact the actual project -- getting features to users and empowering the business. Which can make the task even more difficult."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"One thing I&#39;ve always wondered: How do you prevent ransomware from ruining your backups, too?Lots of ransomware tends to be &#34;delayed&#34; – it can&#39;t encrypt everything instantly, so it encrypts a little bit each minute. During those minutes, isn&#39;t it conceivable that the now-encrypted files replace your old backups?I suppose this isn&#39;t really a &#34;backup&#34; but rather a &#34;mirroring strategy.&#34; But for certain kinds of data -- photos, video, large media -- can you really afford to do any other kind of strategy?The other question I have is related to that first point: since ransomware can&#39;t encrypt everything all at once, how is it possible for your system to continue to function? As you can tell, I&#39;m a ransomware noob, but it&#39;s quite interesting to me from an engineering standpoint. Does the system get into a &#34;half encrypted&#34; state where, if you rebooted it, it would fail to boot at all? Or does ransomware targeted at businesses tend to be more of a surgical strike, where it targets and wipes out specific datastores before anyone notices?(It&#39;s the &#34;before anyone notices&#34; part that I&#39;m especially curious about. Isn&#39;t there some kind of alarm that could be raised more or less instantly, because something detects unexpected binary blobs being created on your disk?)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This really hits home, decades ago - I was working at this place that did daily tape backups.  I remember thinking, this is unreal - there&#39;s literally a room filled with tapes.One day, I asked if they ever had performed a recovery off of the tapes, as I questioned if the tapes were even being written to.  (NOTE:  Backups was not my job at all. )Why had I brought this up?  I would be in the server room and never saw the blinky lights on the tape...well.. blink. Everyone literally laughed at me, thought was a grade A moron.A year later, servers died... Pop&#39;ed in the tape... Blank.  No worries, they had thousands more of these tapes.  Sadly, they were all MT.  They had to ship hard drives to a recovery shop, and it was rather expensive.I left shortly after this."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Congrats!I tried Julia for the first time last week and it was great.I&#39;ve been playing with the idea of defining a hash function for lists that can be composed with other hashes to find the hash of the concatenation of the lists. I tried to do this with matrix multiplication of the hash of each list item, but with integer mod 256 elements random matrices are very likely to be singular and after enough multiplications degenerates to the zero matrix. However, with finite field (aka Galois fields) elements, such a matrix is much more likely to be invertible and therefore not degenerate. But I don&#39;t really know anything about finite fields, so how should I approach it? Here&#39;s where Julia comes in: with some help I was able to combine two libraries, LinearAlgebraX.jl which has functions for matrices with exact elements, with GaloisFields.jl which implements many types of GF, and wrote up a working demo implementation of this &#34;list hash&#34; idea in a Pluto.jl  [2] notebook and published it [0] (and a question on SO [1]) after a few days without having any Julia experience at all. Julia seems pretty approachable, has great libraries, and is very powerful (I was even able to do a simple multithreaded implementation in 5 lines).[0]: https://blog.infogulch.com/2021/07/15/Merklist-GF.html[1]: https://crypto.stackexchange.com/questions/92139/using-rando...[2]: https://github.com/fonsp/Pluto.jl"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I played with Julia a bit in grad school. Although I didn&#39;t end up using it much after that I thought it was a lovely language. Forget python, I hope Julia manages to kill off Matlab and its weird stranglehold on various pockets of academia. Congrats to the team here."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Congrats to the Julia team.I am a python developer who has dabbled with Julia but it never stuck for me.I think Julia was built by academics for other academics running innovative high performance computing tasks. It excels at the intersection of 1) big data, so speed is important, and 2) innovative code, so you can&#39;t just use someone else&#39;s C package. Indeed, Julia&#39;s biggest successful applications outside academica closely resemble an academic HPC project (eg Pumas). I think it will continue to have success in that niche. And that&#39;s not a small niche! Maybe it&#39;s enough to support a billion dollar company.But most of us in industry are not in that niche. Most companies are not dealing with truly big data, on our scale, it is cheaper to expand the cluster than it is to rewrite everything in Julia. Most who ARE dealing with truly big data, do not need innovative code; basic summary statistics and logistic regression will be good enough, or maybe some cloud provider&#39;s prepackaged turn key neural nets scale out training system if they want to do something fancy.I think for Julia to have an impact outside of academia (and academia-like things in industry) it will need to develop killer app packages. The next PyTorch needs to be written in Julia. Will that happen? Maybe! I hope so! The world would be better off with more cool data science packages.But I think the sales pitch of &#34;it&#39;s like Pandas and scikit but faster!&#34; is not going to win many converts. So is Jax, Numba, Dask, Ray, Pachyderm, and the many other attempts within the Python community of scaling and speeding Python, that require much less work and expense on my part for the same outcome.Again, congrats to the team, I will continue to follow Julia closely, and I&#39;m excited to see what innovative capabilities come out of the Julia ecosystem for data scientists like me."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I&#39;m an engineering software contractor and every client has a whole bucket load of outdated IDEs and random USB interface drivers they want me to install on my machine. Often this stuff has weird specific version dependencies, kernel level drivers that cause weird things to happen (like the computer to BSOD if you boot it up with other USB devices attached), random system level crashes, and when you go to the driver download page there are always an unsettling list of simple security vulns noted.The #1 thing that I&#39;ve ever wanted is a Linux that lives between the bootloader and Windows that lets me achieve native performance on the Windows VM, but gives me an environment where I can easily do all the things that you can usually do in HyperV like create snapshots, clone installs, share Sharepoint drives between images, etc. But I do need something that is perfectly stable and just works. This is the right technology (thank you so much for working on it), but just not yet at a maturity that makes me feel comfortable about putting livelihood on the line.Edit: actually, please, if anyone knows something that suits this use-case, even if it costs decent money, please leave a comment."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"If anyone is interested, the main developer, who goes by &#39;gnif&#39; spends a decent amount of time on the dedicated Looking Glass sub-forum on the Level1Techs forum, here:https://forum.level1techs.com/c/software/lookingglass/142Level1Techs also has a ton of information and help both on the forum, and their YouTube channel, about setting up Looking Glass and VFIO. The main host of the YouTube channel, Wendell, has forgotten more about nitty-gritty system administration than I will likely ever know in my lifetime. He also just seems like a genuinely good human being."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I run a VFIO setup with a single GPU - the linux host is headless, and Windows runs on top with the GPU. Its pretty awesome. Windows runs at native performance - no problem gaming or running other heavy workloads. The linux host acts as a devbox and runs a few other homeserver style services.It&#39;s difficult to set up right but it taught me a lot about VMs and hardware. Once you get it setup well enough, its relatively painless. Like I haven&#39;t messed with my VM settings in over a year, everything just continues to work smoothly. Including windows updates, driver upgrades, most online games with anti-cheat etc. If i upgrade my hardware, it might take a day or two of tinkering to get it back up. Based on my benchmarking it runs within ~5% of native perf.This is still the best guide IMO if you want to set it up - https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/PCI_passthrough_via_OVMF. Single GPU is basically the same as dual GPU, except you have to ensure the linux host does not take over the GPU or load any drivers for it during boot."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Pre M1, I&#39;ve always preferred a PC.When I&#39;m using a laptop, especially doing real work, they heat up, the fans go crazy, the laptop is hot to the touch and everything slows down.It almost makes you anxious. You&#39;re wondering if it&#39;s about to crash or go on fire.I&#39;ve always kept a Desktop PC on the go for this reason, a well cooled desktop just doesn&#39;t have these issues. With a laptop, I always feel like I&#39;m compromising a bit.I got an M1 Macbook Pro recently and it just doesn&#39;t have these issues, I fire up my whole dev environment and get busy, and it&#39;s still quiet and (mostly) cool, and I can&#39;t notice anything slowing down.I don&#39;t care so much about the architecture differences, x64 vs ARM etc, but the fact that I can finally use a laptop like a desktop is massive."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is funny.  For the last ten years I&#39;ve used Mac laptops as my primary machine.  Of course the fan noise was a great auditory clue to tell me to check out Activity Monitor/top for rogue processes and help me optimize which tasks took too many resources.I didn&#39;t realize how much I relied on that cue until I temporarily switched to a Mac desktop machine during the pandemic when I didn&#39;t need to travel.  The desktop fans pretty much stay at 1200rpm all the time.  I think I&#39;ve seen them spike once.  I&#39;d forgotten how much better desktops can be for some things.Now I&#39;m looking for a better remote access solution so I can consider sticking with a desktop at home and then maybe just an iPad for travel with good remote access and file sync."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"That&#39;s pretty hilarious.  Until recently I didn&#39;t think of the CPU fan as an auditory cue for how hard your system is working.  But now I can remember times that excessive fan noise has prompted me to investigate the cause of excessive usage."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Big tech censorship will not solved without addressing the other half of a problem with two sides.Without systems that promote quality, non-ideological, nuanced, original, tolerant dialogue we will keep running into the false dilemma of unmoderated cess pools or heavy handed moderation.If we are to avoid this dilemma we need systems that organically promote constructive, tolerant and inclusive communication, and original, nuanced, intelligent, non-ideological ideas, instead of the opposite.This cannot be done by organizations whose profit incentive is aligned with user attention instead of user satisfaction.Those organizations benefit from degraded communication until strong moderation is both continually demanded and decried.---On a side note, I am so disappointed in the constant framing of ideas as right or left. It dumbs society down incredibly to view so much through the filter of two (often arbitrarily correlated, historically shifting) clusters of supposedly disjoint options.In the real world, communes work well sometimes, markets often work better at scale but not for everything, markets require &#34;social solutions&#34; like non-commercial criminal and civil justice systems, education and health could be explicitly tested and then managed as investments with a pay off of lower taxes (including for the rich) instead of as charities forced on the rich, etc.The Right/Left and associated ideologies are all self-defeating when believed in isolation and the nuances of their ragged edges, their limitations, and constructive combinations ignored."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This all sounds very nice, but there&#39;s a bit of sleight of hand here since the article goes out of its way to avoid details. That way everyone reads into exactly what they want, and it&#39;s totally non-obvious whether this is actually a workable proposal or not.But what&#39;s the concrete proposal here? How would things actually work? Will the services be forced to accept whatever unmoderated feed of filth the linked to service sends their way? If not, how is this supposed to fix the moderation problem?How are you supposed to link together applications with totally different data, interaction, and identity models? Obviously you couldn&#39;t link e.g. say Discord to Instagram and have the interactions between the systems make any sense. Are we just going to have a predefined ontology of possible social networkign apps, populated with the currently existing models, and define an API for all of then? When and how does that ontology get redefined? Or define a single lowest common denominator covering everything? What happens with features that don&#39;t fit into the models? They&#39;re entirely forbidden? They need to go through a multi-year public review bureacracy?Who exactly will be forced to interoperate, and who gets a free pass?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt;First of all, the internet’s “marketplace of ideas” is severely lopsided at the platform levelThe marketplace of ideas itself has been show to be a bust in recent years, IMHO.Better ideas, better models of truth and reality don&#39;t win out. People have not shown themselves interested in intellectual debate or argument. We do not see the &#39;best&#39; ideas rise to the top. And before anyone asks who I am to judge the best ideas, I&#39;ll answer - nobody, but I can see that factually incorrect, scientifically illiterate, conspiratorial, harmful crank ideas gain legs in the online world we&#39;ve created. Often at the root of these is a profit motive.Is censorship the best way to deal with it? Probably not. But we do need to recognise this as a problem as well as getting het up about giant internet platforms deplatforming people."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&gt; The investigation by the Guardian and 16 other media organisations suggests widespread and continuing abuse of NSO’s hacking spyware, Pegasus, which the company insists is only intended for use against criminals and terrorists. (from the Guardian inquiry about the same topic).Every time we allow special laws or special tools to fight &#34;terrorism&#34; or &#34;child abuse&#34; or other evils that get people worked up, they end up being used against the people in general. Every time. Why are we even surprised."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"For politicians in democracies citizens are potential voters, foreigners don&#39;t matter.It&#39;s still arguably better than dictatorships, where your citizens don&#39;t matter either, as long as you have a good police system.We act surprised when we notice such things but we shouldn&#39;t be, it is a mistake to apply the same standards that we, as the lucky citizens of &#34;free countries&#34; enjoy, to any other system of power.From a less cynical point of view, as an Israeli, I am not happy at all to see this kind of export products from my country. It is in great part because of the conflict. Te SIGINT units are huge and among the people who graduate from the army with this kind of knowledge you will certainly find many who will turn a blind eye to ethics for a huge paycheck. Not to mention that the research itself that the defense apparatus needs attracts capitals from other countries that will buy some of it and use it for unorthodox means. I wish we exported less of these things, especially to autocratic countries. I agree it&#39;s horrible."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The people who work in these companies should be absolutely shunned and black listed from laundering their past by taking up a role at any major tech firm.The people who work at NSO and companies like this are a stain on the whole tech industry and are outcasted by their own IOF peers for being greedy and morally-lacking.Absolutely disgusting to think your hands are clean while you make tools that directly empower dictators and keep whole regions of people subjugated."</p>

I am looking for more ideas to experiment. Here&#39;s one idea which someone from another forum gave me: exploring recursive queries and using SQLite random methods to do the insertions.Another crazy idea is to learn about SQLite file format and just write the pages to disk."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"You can go even faster if you can organize your problem such that you simply start from a copy of a template SQLite database each time (it is just a file/byte sequence).We do SQL evaluation for a lot of business logic throughout our product, and we have found that starting from a template database (i.e. one with the schema predefined and canonical values populated) can save a lot of time when working in tight loops."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Database optimization posts are always interesting, but it&#39;s really hard to do any apples to apples comparison. Your performance is going to depend mostly on your hardware, internal database settings and tunings, and OS level tunings. I&#39;m glad this one included some insight into the SQLite settings disabled, but there&#39;s always going to be too many factors to easily compare this to your own setup.For most SQL systems, the fastest way to do inserts is always just going to batched inserts. There&#39;s maybe some extra tricks to reduce network costs/optimize batches [0], but at it&#39;s core you are still essentially inserting into the table through the normal insert path. You can basically then only try and reduce the amount of work done on the DB side per insert, or optimize your OS for your workload.Some other DB systems (more common in NoSQL) let you actually do real bulk loads [1] where you are writing direct(ish) database files and actually bypassing much of the normal write path.[0] https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/insert-optimization....

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Do Signal, Wire, or Matrix do this transcript consistency thing, or is there some other way by which they prevent message reordering? From what I know, encrypted messengers almost never implement that. At least in Wire I noticed reordering at some point and it uses an implementation of what is now called the Signal protocol.And that&#39;s the most severe vulnerability from the article. The second one is &#34;mostly of theoretical interest&#34; according to the researchers themselves, the third requires &#34;an attacker [to] send many carefully crafted messages to a target, on the order of millions of messages&#34;, and the fourth &#34;requires sending billions of messages to a Telegram server within minutes&#34;. So while this is not bad research, not at all (it&#39;s really great that people take this close a look!), the title sounds rather more severe and people will obviously jump to the conclusion that &#34;See, MTproto is bad like we said all along!&#34; without reading anything. Good research, bad article?«Obligatory notice in Telegram comment threads: the real issue in Telegram is that end-to-end encryption is optional and made extremely inconvenient to use: no implementation at all in TDesktop, can&#39;t use it across multiple devices, doesn&#39;t work for group chats at all... That is the main reason Telegram isn&#39;t secure: they can read all your chats except when you use this stupid inconvenient mode.»"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Given how bashing on MTProto is a favourite cryptographers&#39; activity from the day-0, I&#39;m actually kinda encouraged by the fact that&#39;s all they found. It&#39;s especially nice, that htey could fix all of them without breaking back-compatibility, which isn&#39;t really a given for crypto protocols. Would appreciate more technical and less dumbed down responses from the Telegram team, though. I have no idea what the fuck &#34;counting grains in the bags of sound&#34; is supposed to mean.(Also, it&#39;s funny, but being accustomed to SMS and such I always somehow assumed Telegram messages can be reordered by chance too, if I send them fast. I never really thought about it, obviously, but simply didn&#39;t expect it to be otherwise.)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"While bashing on Telegram is basically HNs favorite past time, there aren&#39;t many other alternatives that work just as well in the area that I care the most about: being a great chat app. Telegram is fast, has native clients instead of a garbage web ui (or electron based app), has better stickers than the alternatives, is easy to write bots for and has a larger user base where I&#39;m at than any of the alternatives other than WhatsApp."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&gt;&#34;as @AmnestyTech observed and we @citizenlab can confirm, NSO Group&#39;s Pegasus spyware delivered via 0-click exploits is no longer &#34;persistent&#34; in the strict sense of the word (i.e., doesn&#39;t come back when you reboot). Persistence is achieved via firing the 0-click again. Because the 0-clicks they&#39;re using appear to be quite reliable, the lack of traditional &#34;persistence&#34; is a feature, not a drawback of the spyware.  It makes the spyware more nimble, and prevents recovery of the &#34;good stuff&#34; (i.e., the spyware and exploits) from forensic analysis.&#34;Oh that&#39;s bad."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"How is it legal?I live in France, I know we have more worker protection laws than most countries, but I expected at least some from all first world countries.Factory work is typically among the most regulated kind of work, and often unionized too. Things tend to be very clear: there is a boss, there is punch clock, it is not like software development where it is not clear when you are working and when you are not. It is easy to see exactly what is happening."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Anyone knows why people decide to do this kind of time consuming work? Is the world getting hard enough that there is no alternative?Whenever I see people working really hard in other parts of the world, especially when the country is filled with other opportunities, I always wonder is it just everyone else that is raising the bar and now the standard is very time consuming work.For example, there&#39;s year long tourism on Madeira. Everyone there is working hard all year long, charging for tourist services very cheaply. Yet there are many examples of places with year long tourism, but you can still find mass closures during siesta.Everyone, through culture, decided not to overwork and there&#39;s no one &#34;hard-working&#34; enough to have their business open during siesta. No employee will agree to work during siesta, similarly employers do not expect their business to be open."</p>

Much recommendedFrom Rosten’s Wikipedia page [2]:—In his book, The Joys of Yiddish, he defines the word chutzpah as &#34;that quality enshrined in a man who, having killed his mother and father, throws himself on the mercy of the court because he is an orphan.&#34;—-[0] https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nos_amis_les_Français(Funnily, the booklet’s title was translated to “Our friends the French”)[1] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Joys_of_Yiddish[2] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leo_Rosten"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Fakespot is one of the more atrocious extensions when it comes to data collection. It sends everything you look at, everything you add to cart, while you are logged out of everything it will also persistently track your viewed items with a unique identifier. I understand that the below may be in PP/ToS but come on, a normal user will not.It does a lot of things completely opaque to the normal end user that are well above a &#34;please tell me if item X&#39;s reviews are good or bad&#34; - it practically sends Fakespot almost every single page interaction or click that you do on an Amazon property.It does the same on every other site it supports - whether or not you want your item inspected, it will notify Fakespot about what products you viewed, what browser, what you clicked on, Add to Cart or Buy Now clicks, Sort clicks, every product visible on page (by ID and seller).They also use the same unique session identifier across sites, so items you look at on eBay/Walmart/etc can be tied to the same person as items viewed on Amazon. If you choose to try to opt out of automatic item detection, that choice is also sent back to their servers (where it then returns a 4xx and tells you to sign up or sign in to fakespot with an account to save settings).The extension itself is many megabytes of heavily packed and obfuscated JS. If you have it installed, I would recommend not doing so."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Why is everyone here just blaming Amazon? Of course they&#39;re going to ask Apple to do this. It&#39;s in their own self-interest.The more interesting questions is, why is Apple complying? Are they afraid that Amazon will retaliate by pulling their apps out of the App Store? If so, are they really just going to keep prioritizing big tech connections in favor of it&#39;s own customers?The rule cited is so vague that even a basic paid browser app would break it. All the app does is augment data available from any web browser with other data.&gt; 5.2.2 Third-Party Sites/Services: If your app uses, accesses, monetizes access to, or displays content from a third-party service, ensure that you are specifically permitted to do so under the service’s terms of use. Authorization must be provided upon request."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"EIP 1559 is a substantial change to the handling of gas fees on the network. In addition to making gas fees be 2 parts (base and &#34;priority&#34; fees), this includes a provision for &#34;burning&#34; the base fee, reducing the overall ETH supply. From the code itself:  # miner only receives the priority fee; note that the base fee is not given to anyone (it is burned)

Models i have seen suggest this will not make ETH deflationary, as the expected burn rates are outpaced by expected mining rates, but the proposal does specifically make note of this[1].1: https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1559#eth-burn-precludes-f..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"If readers are curious how to get up-and-running with a (non-mining) full node (ETH1) at home, it&#39;s quite simple.This is how I did/do it on my Intel NUC running Ubuntu Server 20.04:1. Download a prebuilt binary from https://geth.ethereum.org/downloads/.2. Unpack it. Optionally make it (or a symlink) available in your PATH.3. Create a service definition, enable it, and start it:   [Unit]
   Description=Go Ethereum
   
   [Service]
   Type=simple
   WorkingDirectory=/home/user
   ExecStartPre=/usr/bin/bash -c &#34;/usr/bin/systemctl set-environment GETH_EXT_IP=$$(/home/user/.local/bin/ext-ip.sh)&#34;
   ExecStart=/home/user/.local/bin/geth \
     --nat extip:${GETH_EXT_IP} \
     --ws
   StandardError=append:/home/user/.ethereum/geth.log
   PermissionsStartOnly=true
   User=user
   Group=user
   Restart=always
   RestartSec=5
   
   [Install]
   WantedBy=default.target


The script ~/.local/bin/ext-ip.sh consists of:   #!/usr/bin/env bash
   
   dig TXT +short o-o.myaddr.l.google.com @ns1.google.com | awk -F&#39;&#34;&#39; &#39;{print $2}&#39;


And that&#39;s it. geth will start syncing mainnet and will likely finish in under 12 hours (depending on your Internet connection, of course).Note: the initial sync is intensive in both network and disk IO, you&#39;ll need an SSD. Also, running a full node long-term (without pruning) currently eats quite a bit of disk space:   $ du -sh ~/.ethereum/geth

   598G /home/user/.ethereum/geth"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"My favorite book for learning SQL is “The Art of PostgreSQL”. https://theartofpostgresql.com/I found the combination of real-world problems, general SQL advice, and the broad range of topics to be a really good book. It took my SQL from “the database is not much more than a place to persist application data” to “the application is not much more than a way to match commands to the database”. It’s amazing how much bespoke code is doing a job the database can do for you in a couple of lines."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"SQL is both slightly ugly (which I attribute to the historical decision to use natural language words instead of the mathematical symbols of the relational algebra notation - the symbols make the expressions more readable once you learn them) and very beautiful. I&#39;m sad most of the people have forgotten it and prefer to use ORMs today. Most often (except when coding a stupid low-feature phonebook/todolist tutorial) it seems to me writing SQL queries manually is a way more efficient (not only in terms of execution speed but also for  developing) solution than using an ORM, except you have to have some fluency in SQL which the most of the today coders seem to lack. Designing a normalized entity-relation model as well as writing the queries for it also feels great, very satisfying."</p>

Another implicit assumption is that we&#39;ll be able to move forward unilaterally with such a solution, instead of it becoming a political football until it&#39;s too late to do anything, like climate change.

And, according to his “school of thought”, my understanding of the world and economics incorrect. We had many interesting discussions about what we thought we knew.Now I’m in my 30s and my thought has changed drastically. I believe that reductionist (materialistic) approaches to analyze human endeavor are misguided. There is a bit of hubris in thinking that a computer simulation can predict the entirety of human action. I am definitely not suscribed to the Austrian school of thought, however."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Interesting. My stack ranking of unethical tech companies would have Twitter at the very top. None of the others have caused as much societal harm as Twitter. I saw research recently that as much as half of all trending topics in Turkey were manufactured by malicious actors to spread propaganda. Also, it&#39;s just an endless pit of addictive negativity. I once had a girlfriend who would browser Twitter for hours on end and was perpetually angry. Not a good way to live.Google, on the other hand, has a bunch of products like Maps, Drive, Docs, and Meet that are legitimately helpful and useful. I would have no ethical qualms about helping to make Docs better. This is not to say Google is an ethical company in the aggregate, but there are certainly a lot of roles you could take there that would not require you to question your morality every time you start a new task."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; &#34;Maybe we were just a bit naive,&#34; Cornet said.They likely were, and think of me what you like but I&#39;ve noticed the same with most Americans I&#39;ve known. Not sure why that is but apparently there&#39;s some good amount of propaganda going on in the USA and people apparently believe it. Meanwhile people have to pay $5000 after an ambulance picks them up. Or $90000 for semi-trivial medical procedures.I believe asking yourself &#34;is my country really like I believe it is?&#34; is a good food for thought even it&#39;s a bit sideways to this here topic at hand.--On topic:I can sympathize with the author. I know what it is to have been a long time in a company; it becomes much more than a workplace. You have friends, you even have people you invite to your Sunday barbecues. It&#39;s also very likely that a number of internal processes are going smoother for you because you know whom to ping and what exactly to write in a form so your stuff gets done quicker. You have job stability and unless you are rocking the boat too much your seat is likely 99% safe.All of those become true stoppers when you start pondering leaving. They pull you back and make you doubt yourself and your idea of switching company.But unlike a number of commenters here I find nothing hypocritical about the decision to go to Twitter. We don&#39;t know how Twitter operates internally; maybe it&#39;s still better than Google. Or maybe they are still after FAANG level of wages so are ready to make some ethical compromises for them?In any case, immediately discounting somebody&#39;s opinion on a corporation because they joined another corporation misses a lot of context, is flamey and non-constructive and almost smells like a paid troll, and is something I don&#39;t expect HN to condone. But sadly, here we go, it&#39;s the top comment here."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"It seems to me the author&#39;s divergence of views may be due to his increasing focus on politics, with a particular orientation that explicitly shows through the comics. It may just be a reflection of what&#39;s happening at scale in Silicon Valley&#39;s tech world, a movement which Twitter, which the author joined most likely not coincidentally, is at the forefront of."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I had trouble finding a good FI planning and simulation tool that could model things in enough detail to finally ditch my spreadsheets... so I decided to build one: ProjectiFihttps://projectifi.io/A while back I posted a very early version here (https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=26969173), and just released a major overhaul with loads of new features and enhancements, many inspired by the initial HN commentary:- Monte Carlo mode with customizable simulations, variables, probability distributions- Backtesting on historical data- Multiple data persistence options for subscribers: cloud synchronization, localStorage only, or manual import/export- Stock/bond allocation curve over time- Improved support for international use cases (currency + locale selector, custom options and contribution limits for financial goals)- Ability to quickly switch between deterministic and probabilistic modes- Many new event types to model a broader range of scenarios- Better support for married filing jointly / couples planning (perhaps still not perfect, but definitely better)- Redesigned landing page, additional UI improvements- And more!If you feel like checking it out, I would love to hear what you think. Most of the functionality is free, but for anyone interested in upgrading to Premium, you can use coupon code &#34;HN-15&#34; for 15% off all plans :)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I actually have a draft open in gmail that i was meaning to send to you, so ill post it here instead :)I saw your initial release of this many months ago, tried it out, was like, ok thats kinda cool, put it down.But then recently i needed to do some serious life financial planning, remembered your tool, searched for the HN post and gave it a real go.... and WOW.  Im so impressed. It does exactly what i need; give me a semi-realistic long term plan of finances, retirement, how much house i can afford, effect of jobs, stocks, etc. Being able to play around with scenarios like &#34;what if one of us didnt work for a few years?&#34; really easily. I probably could do all this stuff on a spreadsheet, but the fiddly details of things like inflation, raises, tax, etc are incredibly tedious to model. theres a lot of near term budgeting type apps etc out there, but there was no other product i found that works so well for long term macro stuff. So its well worth the premium subscription fee to me, on a time saved basis alone.The UI/X is mostly great(ill email you some minor suggestions :) ), and your development velocity is really impressive.Perhaps the total market for a tool like this is niche, but hopefully it turns into a profitable enough endeavor for you so you can keep working on it forever :)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;m super interested in this, but, every time I try this you end up losing me in the funnel.  It takes too long to set everything up and I eventually lose interest and exit."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"FYI, this appears to be a startup launching an e-mail signup for a product that isn&#39;t available yet. Nothing wrong with that, of course, but it&#39;s worth noting up front. There is no download link and the GitHub link goes to an issues-only repo with no code.There are several fast Rust-based, GPU-accelerated terminal projects that are open source and under active development:Alacritty: https://github.com/alacritty/alacrittyWezterm: https://github.com/wez/weztermFig ( https://fig.io/ ) isn&#39;t Rust, but it&#39;s worth noting as a YC-backed competitor terminal product that has autocomplete similar to Warp.dev. Their website is eerily similar to warp.dev &#39;s website, to the point where I can&#39;t help but imagine one was the inspiration for the other."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Somehow it feels odd that an implementation detail like the programming language it&#39;s implemented in is so prominent in the project&#39;s description. I have no idea what bash is written in and frankly I don&#39;t care much about it. It&#39;s a tool that enables me do be more productive. Could it be faster? Probably, but does anyone even notice that in the context of all the other things that we do _with_ it?Are there any benefits I&#39;m missing that come from it being implemented in Rust?"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The Salton Sea is already a man made disaster deep into ecological collapse.  Even if they do it terribly, I doubt they&#39;ll make anything worse.  It&#39;s also a region with no economic future, so hopefully this brings some jobs.  This will be interesting to watch, I&#39;m hopeful."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"One thing to note - the headline of the article itself is incorrect. It says &#34;GM Will Suck Lithium From the Salton Sea&#34; In fact the lithium is being extracted from brine thousands of feet below the Salton Sea, as is stated in the article itself. Also GM is not doing the work, they signed an agreement with another company that is actually doing it. HN reworded headline is better."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I find that area geologically fascinating.  It&#39;s one of the few above-water rift zones in the world.  According to https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salton_Trough the sediment fills it in as quickly as it sinks, so you have sediment in some areas going down 20,000 feet.The earthquakes seem to come in swarms out there, which I think is a result of the pulling apart.  In a thrust fault or strike-slip fault, you have a release of energy and while the stress is transferred somewhere else, that seems to be the end of the movement.  When you pull two plates apart, you create a gap and the stuff above it sort of settles down into the gap, probably causing the successive earthquakes as it all settles into the new position.I really wish we had a canal to the Salton Sea.  Having a new inland port and a source of fresher water would dramatically change the area."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Part of my job is to help the executives that I report to understand why things went wrong from the security perspective in our business unit. These are purely internal discussions, not even investigations. There are no penalties, but really, for things as egregious as hard coded passwords. As will become clear in a moment, the fact that my executives care is quite unusual.Culturally the result is coverups and lies.Engineers lie, managers lie, test people lie, directors lie, senior directors lie, vice president lie, external interesting teams are negotiated into minimizing certain critical failures, and so on. Managers don’t want to hear it so that they can’t be accused of lying, vice presidents don’t wanna know, SVP’s just want green squares on the cross-BU PowerPoint.This is internal discussion of revenue impacting incidents. Do you know what executives do care about? Revenue. Lost deals. If the people who care about money, including the account teams, don’t care about security and severe quality issues enough to be honest enough to get to improvement, how could an external board accomplish anything for those very few incidents that actually become publicly visible?This isn’t like the NTSB; I spent my life reading NTSB accident reports. They have actual real authority, there are potentially issues that might impact someone more than being caught distorting things."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"In washington state, the state superior court ruled the police department was not liable for the impound fee paid by somebody who had their car impounded for 90* days for driving on what the computer reported was a suspended license, because they are exempt from mistakes from trusting their own computer system.This was the second time the department had wrongfully impounded his car and they made no attempt to fix the mistake from the first time, this didn&#39;t impact the ruling.Its gonna get much worse before it get any better."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"In Washington State we have a system to track cannabis, the enforcement officers are supposed to be able to get reports from this system.  The system is super buggy and also doesn&#39;t have meaningful reports.  So there is a secondary system for officers to export to Excel documents.  In one of the trainings they&#39;ve been instructed to look for anomalies -- not real analisys, not even a pivot table.  One thing they find is &#34;negative quantities&#34; -- but how can that be? (hint: it&#39;s bugs in the tracking software).  Then enforcement shows up at the cannabis business to audit these negative numbers (or demand the business try to correct the data (which they cannot due to bugs)).So, crappy software gets law enforcement officers to basically review data &#34;anomalies&#34; created by bugs by visiting a business. The second most expensive method for data sanatization I can imagine.  It&#39;s a poor use of their time and disruptive to the business.The system in WA is so buggy that the agency has opted to freeze the software rather than try to fix the issues.  The future of government software is bleak -- so long as they keep using closed source packages from low-cost bidders."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I see a lot of comments misinterpreting this.First, it&#39;s not about private files, it&#39;s about distributing content.Google isn&#39;t spying on your private files, but does scan them when you share them publicly. E.g. keep all the pirated movies you want on your Drive, and even give private access to friends, but the moment you make them publicly viewable Google scans them and limits access accordingly. So no, this isn&#39;t applying to your private diary or privately shared documents.And second, to those who claim absolute free speech with no limits -- notice that the two main categories here are related to democracy and health. All our legal protections ultimately depend on a democratic foundation -- undo that with misinformation and you don&#39;t have anything anymore. Similarly, your rights don&#39;t matter much if you&#39;re dead. Companies aren&#39;t allowed to advertise rat poison as medicine and neither are you."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I just cancelled my drive subscription.I don&#39;t know how anyone could continue using it after this.I probably have dozens of docs and hundreds of research papers contradicting government health advice on diabetes and heart disease. These would fall under &#34;Misleading content related to harmful health practices&#34; since they promote a health theory which the government considers harmful.However I would have cancelled regardless since the idea of automatic bans and/or content deletion based on ML models is crazy. They are obviously going to find a lot a false positives and I can&#39;t deal with the idea of trying to speak to google to explain that their algorithm mistakenly flagged my innocent content. In other words even if you are the perfect citizen, there is a chance you will get flagged anyway."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&#34;Misinformation&#34; is just another word for &#34;falsehood&#34; or &#34;untruth.&#34;Those of you claiming that &#34;democracy&#34; depends on authorities preventing the spread of misinformation are ipso facto saying that democracy requires the government, or megacorporate cartels with a monopoly on public speech most likely acting as proxies for the government (as Psaki made clear is happening), to define what counts as &#34;truth&#34; (a Ministry Of Truth if you will) and to stamp out what they&#39;ve defined as &#34;false.&#34;It&#39;s insane, and it&#39;s amazing to me how many of you have your heads so far up your assessment with partisanship that you can&#39;t see that the recent media hysteria over &#34;misinformation&#34; is a blatant example of the contrived &#34;emergencies&#34; that all totalitarian regimes in history have used to seize control over free societies."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Okay, this is just straight up awesome. I&#39;ve played piano for 37 years. I&#39;ve built things all my life. But I never even considered the possibility of building a piano from the ground up. Let alone the difficulty of engineering an instrument that defied all the normal parameters. This is real world hacking at its finest. Not to mention it sounds great."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Fun story: four years ago, I hired Adrian to move a second-hand piano into our house. We lived on a very steep area with a narrow elbow driveway. Adrian has this incredible spatial memory and fine motor control that I still find it hard to believe how he did it.He loaded the piano in his trailer and basically backed his BMW all the way up with half meter at most on each side, slowly through that elbow bend and parked the trailer&#39;s door right on where we planned to unload the piano. Maybe 2cm away from where he intended to land it."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; I think because I was so young I absolutely knew it was totally possible to do, I was fully determined and without consulting any professionals I had no barrier stopping me.IMO, this is the mindset of greatness to come.

Time and time again humans have displayed that the impossible may in fact be nothing more than a lack of imagination."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"My daughter is insulin dependent.We live in the UK - which has a fantastic free provision for diabetics, my daughter has a Diasend artificial pancreas (on her phone + a sensor on her arm and a pump for the insulin controlled by the app). This gives her very very high levels of control and flexibility.However, when covid hit I was really scared because I thought that if things went really wrong (beyond loo paper being sold out) there would be no possibility of me protecting my daughter - I simply had no means to provide insulin for her that don&#39;t depend on a large scale modern pharma supply chain.Any way that was viable for insulin to be made in a shed or a garage would be huge from my perspective because it would give me an option in the case of a SHTF situation - right now I haven&#39;t got one. If things go bad, my daughter dies - no if&#39;s no buts. I know (in my heart) that the reality is that if SHTF then I will die too, but the sheer hopelessness of my daughters position is really hard to take."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"There are two kinds of non-competes, and both have problems.First, there&#39;s the really nasty ones saying &#34;If you ever work here, you can&#39;t work for any competitor for X years&#34;, and they&#39;re clearly abusing of employees, labor, etc. I hope there is a straight up ban on that.The second kind is &#34;You can&#39;t compete with us while you work here&#34;. And that is a much more complex beast. Obviously, if I work as a developer making a stock trading app, I shouldn&#39;t be making a competing stock trading app after hours.But my employer does everything. There is no field that my employer is not involved in, somehow. You can guess who they are, probably, or just read my profile. And they say &#34;You cannot do anything that competes with anything we do&#34;. Which is everything. Want to make a Sudoku app? That&#39;s a game, we do games. Want to do some open source ML library work? We do ML, you can&#39;t do ML outside of work (I asked legal that one). And that&#39;s ignoring the who-knows-how-many secret un-released projects that might relate.They don&#39;t even tell us &#34;no&#34; anymore. They just say &#34;read the non-compete agreement and do what it says&#34;. Basically &#34;do what you like, but if we ever feel like it wasn&#39;t right, you&#39;re fired and maybe sued&#34;.And when I apply to other companies, they ask &#34;do you have a github account?&#34;. No, I&#39;ve been highly motivated not to.Edit: eesh, this was a bit of a rant, wasn&#39;t it? Apologies for that. But maybe folks have ideas on what to do about it, apart from the obvious."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I lived in Alabama for 4 years or so and at least at the time (I have no idea if it&#39;s changed since I left), their non-compete situation was garbage.They were valid and enforceable even if you got laid off or fired. One of my friends&#39; mother got laid off in the 2008 financial crisis from Bellsouth (or AT&amp;T, I don&#39;t recall if the (re)merger was finished yet). She was told she couldn&#39;t work for any other telecom in the state for at least 18 months. She ended up going to stay with family in another state for that time so she could find another job, even though her husband and her son were in AL. It was a hard period for them.I&#39;ve had a hatred of non-competes since for the most part. If you (a company) are afraid of losing key talent, maybe you should actively try to retain it rather than turning your company into a prison."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"My state has severely limited non-compete agreements to the point that they’re only narrowly enforceable, if at all.That didn’t stop  one of my previous employers from using non-compete scare tactics against employees. Many of us left in a large exodus when benefits and bonuses were cut and management made a number of other bad decisions.The company responded by sending remaining employees an e-mail with a list of competitors that they said would be covered by our non-compete agreement. The e-mail implied that if we wanted to leave for one of those companies we needed to get approval from the legal team before we moved, otherwise we might be at risk of being sued.My lawyer rolled his eyes when I showed it to him and explained that they wouldn’t win due to my state’s laws, but they could try to make my life difficult with legal proceedings if they wanted.The tactic worked enough to scare some of my old coworkers away from taking job offers at competitors, though. Some others also went into hiding and lied on their LinkedIn profiles to prevent their old employer from finding out they went to competitors.Having some clear, national guidelines that make non-competes a non-issue would do wonders for situations like this."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I don&#39;t believe the blurred images at the end have anything to do with eye focus, as the author suggests.After all, chromatic aberration is blurring of only a very, very small amount.The demonstrated seemingly negligible perceptual effect of blurring blue to a huge degree in a multicolor image doesn&#39;t seem to have anything to do with that, but rather the fact that we perceive primary blue as a much darker color than primary red or green, and we perceive differences in lighter colors much more easily.If the author were correct that we have big problems focusing on blue, then we&#39;d see that blue text against a black background would be massively blurry -- but it&#39;s simply not. It&#39;s comparatively low-contrast (because blue is a dark color), but it&#39;s nearly indistinguishably as sharp as red and green."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"One of my favourite series in art is Yves Klein&#39;s blue work. For anyone unfamiliar, he found a blue that he considered the bluest possible blue [1], and went on a journey painting everything in that blue. I loved that he did this, and then eventually managed to get to an exhibition of his work at the Tate Modern and was absolutely blown away by it - it really needs to be seen in the flesh to appreciate it. There&#39;s something about his blue, that when painted on to a sculpture, almost makes the 3D disappear and the sculpture looks 2 dimensional. Extremely beautiful.As a side note, some (many?) cultures around the world have no word for blue, blue is just other shades of green.[1] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Klein_Blue"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"There&#39;s an optometry place in my neighborhood with a back-lit sign with big, blue block letters. And every time I walk by at night I note how fuzzy it looks.I&#39;m convinced this is an intentional troll. This optometrist knowingly picked a sign to make people momentarily question their vision."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&gt; After hours of interrogation, police told one of the teenagers, Terrill Swift, that if he just confessed to being at the scene he could go home — so he did.What&#39;s the advantage to society of allowing interviewers to lie (to anyone, let alone kids)? Not just insinuate something like &#34;your partner&#39;s in the next room, it&#39;s only a matter of time until he talks so you should come clean now&#34;, but blatantly lie and then be able to rely on the result of that in court?It kinda feels a little like the common law doctrine of Promissary Estoppel [0] where if someone relies on something you&#39;ve promised, you can&#39;t then hold them responsible for relying on that thing.[0] https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/promissory_estoppel"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Every American should watch this video. There is no reason to talk to the police, it will pretty much never help you.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-7o9xYp7eEEdit:
The lawyer made a follow up video clarifying that in routine traffic stops police do have autonomy. So as long as you are reasonable and just showing the policeman you aren&#39;t a public menace is seems ok. For any other reason I&#39;d have my lawyer on me no matter what.Also this video specifically pertains to the 5th US constitutional amendment.Also IANAL but the guy in the video is."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I honestly think police shouldn&#39;t be allowed to interview children at all (at least those under 13), it should be left to forensic psychologists. Not just interrogations, interviews of witnesses or potential victims too. Children are simply so easy to lead in questions, there&#39;s an entire field of study in psychology devoted to figuring out how to ask questions of children without leading them. Here&#39;s some examples: if you ask a child a yes-no question that they don&#39;t understand, they default to saying yes. If you ask them a multi-choice question (&#34;Would you rather X, Y, or Z?&#34;) they default to whichever option was given last."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Often I hear the argument, people saying &#34;I prefer ads that are relevant for me over random ads&#34;. But the result of the tracking is not only that you get &#34;relevant&#34; ads, it&#39;s that your timelines and your feeds and your news gets tweaked in ways that makes you engage with ads as much as possible.Not only do you get manipulated in buying stuff you didn&#39;t ask for (ads in general). You&#39;re also getting spoonfed content that tries to make you as vulnerable as possible to this manipulation. Up to a point that this is downright threatening democracy and our way of life.I guess you could call this a form of censorship. Content gets suppressed, simply because it doesn&#39;t generate enough ad revenue. It&#39;s this type of censorship on &#34;social&#34; media that I consider much more harmful than the type that usually gets most of our attention."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I dislike being tracked as much as the next guy, but I often wonder what &#34;our&#34; ideal end-game goal is? By &#34;our&#34; I mean the typical HN crowd that understands both the technological and the economical implications of this.If we want top-grade products to remain available without a direct monetary transaction (i.e &#34;free&#34;), it seems we must give something that the product providers can turn into monetary value indirectly somehow. Yet it seems we are actively against any such options: We block ads guilt-free, we rally against any attempt at collecting valuable personal information even anonymously, we consider crypto mining in the background (which is basically paying via your electricity bill) borderline malware.I am part of this &#34;we&#34;, and yet I ask myself, what am I willing to give as indirect payment? What other options are there?"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"    After checking the contents of the file to send the report, I was surprised.
    Surprisingly, clearly sensitive information such as GITHUB_REPO_API_KEY and WORKERS_KV_API_TOKEN was displayed. I couldn’t understand what happened for a moment, and when I checked the command log, I found that I accidentally put a link to /proc/self/environ instead of /proc/self/maps.
    […]
    It seems that GitHub notified Cloudflare immediately because GITHUB_REPO_API_KEY (API key of GitHub) was included in the repository, and Cloudflare started incident response immediately after the notification.

    […]

    April 6, 2021 20:30 cdnjs processed the file
    At the same time    GitHub sent an alert to Cloudflare
    At the same time    Cloudflare started an incident response
    Within minutes      Cloudflare finished revocation of credentials
    April 6, 2021 20:40 I sent an initial report

This a nice Github feature. Also kudos to Cloudflare for quickly reacting to this."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I was a bit disappointed by Cloudflare&#39;s HackerOne-based disclosure / bug bounty program.I submitted a working proof-of-concept that would allow you to use Cloudflare&#39;s page-customizing preview function to create a Cloudflare phishing site.The issue was closed as &#34;accepted as the nature of the cloudflarepreview playground&#34;.Then they went ahead and fixed the issue.Not the end of the world, but definitely didn&#39;t inspire confidence in the program."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"There is probably no good reason to use such CDNs nowadays:1) The biggest benefit of using cdn was that scripts stylesheets were often loaded from cache. This is no longer the case anymore.2) It&#39;s adding an unnecessary vulnerability as seen from this case.3) CDN scripts can be (possibly) used to track your website traffic.4) They often drop third party cookies which decreases your website load speed among other things.It&#39;s best to just host your script on Digital ocean spaces or S3 and use a Cloudfront proxy."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Gotta admit, I never saw that coming. I thought SteamOS was dead after the failure of Steam Machines and Valve was only continuing with their Linux efforts because it&#39;s still a useful hedge against Microsoft locking everyone in the App Store. I totally did not expect them to copy the Switch use-case with it.I&#39;m anxious to see how this turns out. Valve&#39;s history with hardware is not so great, so it could go nowhere like Steam Machines, Steam Link, and the Steam Controller did. On the other hand, it could end up all but killing off PC gaming if it is super successful. If it lands somewhere in the middle it will at least be yet another boon for Linux gaming brought to you by Valve as more developers will port or ensure compatibility with Proton."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This was a deliberate decision back in the 1980s and 1990s related to how to structure personnel. You&#39;ll likely recognize it as how software teams are siloed and the concept of &#34;full stack&#34; is kind of a misnomer.The theory was basically that complex systems needed specialization for building and maintenance and that the US military could not afford or recruit the kind of people that could simultaneously run operations, do management AND troubleshoot.In other words, military personnel are not seen as technical experts that focus on one thing for a decade, moreso that they are like project managers who have depth in one area from their first 5-6 years and then &#34;broaden&#34; out to fill in the management layer of the force beyond that.There are exceptions to this of course, warrant officers and the like. However it&#39;s a tiny slice and given how massive the system is and how many sub-systems are involved - the management layer grows in the form of uniformed ranks while the technician layer grows in the contractor ranks because of how the force is structured.The incentive for that contract force however is to keep the contract (and follow on) and the knowledge related to it, so they end up building in these kind of &#34;nobody can touch this but us&#34; requirements. Functionally you can see how this is a self fulfilling prophecy - we aren&#39;t recruting or structuting our force to have the capability to maintain systems because we have a contract force that does it.To fix this a deliberate decision has to be made to change the force structure to build more technicians and unfortunately people like that don&#39;t want to take the pay and lifestyle cut so we just can&#39;t fill out the ranks.I could go on all day, including how the defense industrial base as well as citizens balking at growing the size of the uniformed forces reinforce this system, but it&#39;s a pervasive problem across multiple vectors."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Seems like an old issue. I used to know a WWII British navy officer who complained how the Americans were so wasteful because they would get equipment replaced instead of repairing it themselves. I had assumed it was because their manufacturing capability was greater/cheaper but maybe it was this kind of war profiteering (is that the correct term?)."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Hit or miss here.Hit: can get a field rep who by contract has to be available, in the motor pool, for 1-2 weeks stretches when called. That field rep may have just designed the very weapon system you’re trying to maintain and they improves your readiness in 2 weeks more than 2 years worth of soldier maintenance would, and all for free to the unit.Miss: you find out about that field rep and their cellphone through word of mouth, and the on post field reps are garbage."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"That&#39;s a bit surprising (if not ironic) but I think it may make sense in a way. It&#39;s been pretty clear that Mudabala (an Abu Dhabi fund that bought AMD fabs in 2008 which then became GlobalFoundries) wanted to unload that investment after they stopped shoving money into failed process developments (GloFo licensed their 14nm from Samsung as a reminder after their own 14 failed, and their 7nm failed too), so no surprise on their end.From Intel&#39;s perspective, there are also some US assets from IBM, which GloFo &#34;acquired&#34; in 2014 (for -1.5 billion at the time), which includes some oldish US fabs, but also a patent portfolio. It certainly goes into the current US political narrative that Gelsinger has been pushing.But perhaps more importantly, I think that what Intel is buying is what was sorely lacking them : people and a methodology of working with external customers.
From all I&#39;ve heard over the years, Intel&#39;s process and design teams are so insular and out of touch with the rest of the industry&#39;s practices that they had a terrible time just working with customers. It wasn&#39;t pretty when they tried the two previous time to open up their process. Loads of announcements, few products if any coming out, and when it worked, they ended up buying their customers anyway, see Altera.If Intel truly wants to go in the foundry direction, they&#39;ll get some interesting outside experience, and while it may not make sense from a pure process point of view, considering how much of a sore point their inability to make it work has been on their previous attempts, the idea may have a lot of merit.Perhaps a very smart move from Gelsinger, time will tell, in the meantime I&#39;ll have a laugh at Intel buying AMD&#39;s old fabs :)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Intel wants to get into the foundry business.  99% of what Intel does is for their own chips.  They don&#39;t have the support infrastructure of being able to deal with external customers.  Global Foundries has that.You don&#39;t just decide to make a chip.  There are hundreds of foundry specific libraries, design rules, and more.  There are always problems with the EDA CAD tools for new processes and you need lots of support people to answer questions and help debug problems that your customers are having.Intel has tried being a foundry before multiple times over the last 20 years.  They always fail and give up after a couple of years."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Great article. Since it looks like a lot of folks are interested in this article, some extra background.First, what is forcing? The article actually has a great description of ultrapowers (a key part of the construction) but it goes by a little fast, so you might like Tim Chow&#39;s &#34;A beginner&#39;s guide to forcing&#34; [1] which does a good job not only laying out the mathematical details at a high level, but also really clearly explaining the philosophy of how you prove something independent of the axioms. I found it very illuminating.Second, the article has some interesting notes on how mathematicians go about what axioms to select and which not to. Penelope Maddy&#39;s &#34;Believing the Axioms&#34; [2] is the classic on this topic (it has two parts). It is focused on set theory, so it has a nice description of Martin&#39;s axiom and the arguments for and against. It was nice to read because it is a deeply technical argument (set theory is hard!) but at the same time there is no &#34;right answer&#34;—all of these axioms, after all, are independent of ZFC, and it&#39;s &#34;ok&#34; to add any of them. The arguments are sometimes aesthetic (&#34;rules&#34; versus &#34;surprises&#34;), sometimes pragmatic (what they can and cannot prove), and sometimes involve deep values of what the universe should be like (should higher cardinalities be like lower ones? weirder? simpler?).It might all seem abstract, but if your day job is programming, imagine an argument over how to architect a large and complex system. Perhaps both architectures are possible, but which one is &#34;right&#34;? What arguments would you deploy? Set theorists are also building a large and complex system (the universe of sets) and are having arguments over how it should be built, which things it should make easy and which hard, which technologies should be supported natively (forcing?) and which should not.[1] http://timothychow.net/forcing.pdf

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Man there&#39;s a lot of juicy stuff in this article (Woodin&#39;s Ultimate L program gets briefly alluded to at the end of the article).I just want to point out, because the HN crowd seems to generally not be mathematical Platonists, that this entire article is implicitly assuming a Platonist philosophical foundation. This may cause confusion for lay readers who are not mathematical Platonists.In other words the article assumes that mathematical objects have an objective existence: they either exist or they do not. Hence every single logical axiom has a truth value. You do not get to arbitrarily choose what logical axioms you want. If you do, you can end up choosing the &#34;wrong one.&#34; Therefore it is an important question to understand whether the Continuum Hypothesis is true or not, even if it&#39;s independent of ZFC (and hence requires ultimately philosophical rather than mathematical arguments).If you aren&#39;t a Platonist and instead view logical axioms as having no inherent truth value, but rather foundations that you can pick and choose from as necessary (where in one case you may choose to use an axiom and in another you may choose its negation), then all that might sound very strange to you. In that case, you should mentally substitute every instance of &#34;true&#34; or &#34;false&#34; in the article with &#34;agrees or disagrees with the meta model used to examine the semantics of a logical theory.&#34; In particular, whenever we talk about a formal treatment of the semantics (i.e. model) of a theory, whether that be something like ZFC or a programming language, we must always make those statements relative to a meta-model.For example if we talk about the formal semantics of a language like C, we must first posit a meta-model which already contains notions of things like &#34;integer&#34; and &#34;natural number&#34; which can be used to give meaning to statements such as &#34;performed an operation n times.&#34; If you&#39;re not a Platonist then you probably believe that there are multiple possible meta-models you could use."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"For 50 years, mathematicians have believed that the total number of real numbers is unknowable.It&#39;s an established result that the Continuum Hypothesis is independent of Zermelo–Fraenkel axioms of set theory. No proof is going change that.So whatever has been proved here doesn&#39;t change that. It will take a second to get the reference but Raymond Smullyan says essentially that &#34;we&#39;re not looking for a proof or disproof of CH, we&#39;re looking for an assumption that can be shown to be natural enough that we can take it as an axiom&#34;.Just sayin&#39; since the (subheading) writer seems to be playing fast and loose with the concepts involved.Edit: article goes on to give rigorous explanation but still starting &#34;no one knew&#34; confuses what&#39;s going on."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Oh, I thought this was known. I&#39;m not even joking... A few years ago, I was at a local comic shop, and I watched someone (a kid) play the machine and appear to get a &#34;perfect&#34; shot, key went exactly into the fucking hole... but then it just pulled back. No prize! I was stunned when the kid asked an employee essentially &#34;WTF?&#34; and the employee replied &#34;there&#39;s a chance the key may not turn even though it&#39;s lined up.&#34; So... it&#39;s a game of luck and not a game of skill. All I could think was &#34;doesn&#39;t that make it straight up gambling then?&#34; Who would be liable for changing the mode of operation? Regardless, it&#39;s fucking sketchy and all around pretty awful to take advantage of people like this... $5 million is a bullshit fine for literally stealing from kids. I still feel bad for that kid, it was like a Nintendo Switch or something fucking cool he, IMHO, had stolen from him..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I remember a long time ago in the UK, around 2003 or so, there was a similar problem with Fruit Machines (Slot machines found in UK bars and pubs).Through dumping the ROMs and emulating the machines, it was found that the machines were effectively forcing losses at certain points in gameplay; from the same memory state, you bet high and the machine goes low, or you bet low and the machine goes high, giving you zero chance of winning.There was a campaign called Fairplay that I believe resulted in a fairly small print label being placed on the machines stating that they would at times give no chance of winning; not a great win, but at least it was being said somewhere - http://worldofstuart.excellentcontent.com/fairplay/fruit/bre...The FairPlay site by Stuart Campbell is actually still up, although I remember first reading about it back in PC Zone personally. There&#39;s details on there about replicating the findings, but unfortunately the links are broken; http://www.worldofstuart.excellentcontent.com/fairplay/fruit..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I remember seeing and playing this on a cruise ship.It was a dollar per try, and I shoved in 5 bucks. By the 4th try it was NOTICEABLE that if you press the button at the &#34;right time&#34;, there was a lag before it overshot it and you failed. I pretty much could guess that something like the article discusses was at work, and was simply more a game of luck.Obviously I stopped after that, as a pure luck game is not as fun. If I had known that the default was 700 losses before payout as a default, I would have had a nice drink or 3 and counted the many people that tried it throughout the dayAs a side note, saw one winner at the machine get a wrapped stack of 500, 1 dollar bills"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Manual parsing of complex binary formats (in this case a netfilter control protocol) in hand rolled C code in ring 0. An approach from the innocent 1990&#39;s.Quipping aside, an interesting thing is that this kind of thing used to be callable by root only and even in the early days of putting things behind more fine grained capabilities, CAP_NET_ADMIN probably wasn&#39;t taken very seriously as representing untrusted users. Which begs the question of whether it would be more secure to keep these things root-only and make people do the hard and dangerous part of untrusted input handling in userspace, where it&#39;s also easier (and not forbidden by kernel coding style rules...) to use safer PLT techniques to do it."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I wonder how these vulnerabilities would be treated if the researchers didn&#39;t bother to find an exploit for them?The description of the exploit is so detailed that it gives the impression that discovering the original vulnerability was fairly quick and simple, and the real work is in building a functioning exploit to wriggle through the discovered kernel flaw.If the researchers were to just stop once they discover the vulnerability, and immediately report it to the kernel security team, would it be treated with the same level of seriousness? Could a CVE with the same severity be issued, or would there be arguments over whether or not the bug is exploitable?"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&gt; It&#39;s been frustrating me for a long time that most companies when hiring are looking for people who do lots of side projects and open source work,This is a myth.The number of candidates I interview who have side projects worth looking at or open source contributions is maybe 1-in-10 at most. Any company that requires candidates to have significant open source contributions is going to have a hard time hiring, because it’s not very common.Really, the only time side projects are valuable is when someone needs to fill gaps in their resume. For example, if all of your prior experience was writing PHP backend code but you wanted to apply to a React front-end role, it could be helpful to have something like a React TODO app in your GitHub profile to show that you have some minimal experience with React and front-end work. You don’t need a massive open-source contribution that takes months and months of free time, just something small to show that you have some amount of experience that isn’t reflected in your resume.The side project myth is getting out of control. Most recruiters and hiring managers will never even open your GitHub profile."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; Recruiters want people who do side projects [...] having side projects and doing open source is valued in hiringI think your premise is wrong and you&#39;re vastly overestimating the value of work done outside of your job.- Having side projects: I was never asked past internship interviews. Even interviewing for my first job after graduation, I talked about what I did during my internship, not about side or school projects.- Meaningful yet small contributions to open source: I don&#39;t remember anyone noticing nor asking.- Major contributions to a big open source project: I assume these people get hired easily.Recruiters are not dumb. They know that most good candidates are either not allowed or not willing to work on meaningful projects on the side, outside of a few very specific cases. Don&#39;t waste your time with companies that have delusional hiring standards."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Admittedly it&#39;s been a long time since this has been something I&#39;ve had to worry about - but back when I just asked for it to be cut out the contract. Generally everyone was fine with it, especially when you explain &#34;it&#39;s how I learn to do stuff that benefits me in the office&#34;. I think the general worry was twofold - that a) working on my own stuff would mean I didn&#39;t get my actual job done, and b) that working on my own stuff would mean I leave sooner and it&#39;s costly to pay for recruiters and refill roles.It probably helps explaining what sort of side projects you do, how much time they take, your &#39;real&#39; job pays for you to live and this is the nerdy equivalent to playing 5-a-side football or watching movies.Anecdotally a (very skilled) dev friend recently got a job with a (UK) challenger bank and was required to sign a similar thing, they were happy to carve add exceptions for a couple of things he was working on."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"If you haven&#39;t read or listened to this book yet, I highly recommend it: Daily Rituals: How Artists Work[1]It&#39;s a collection of daily routines of many famous and prolific artists. The surprising thing about so many of the artists is that they only work 2 or 3 hours per day, then spend the rest of the day walking around, socializing, etc. But they consistently show up and put in the work and it adds up to some amazing things over time.This reminds me of another great book about beating procrastination: The Now Habit: A Strategic Program for Overcoming Procrastination and Enjoying Guilt-Free Play[2]In that book, the author talks about his extensive work helping graduate students complete their dissertations. I can&#39;t cover all the great points here, but when working with these students he has them create an &#34;unschedule&#34; where they have to schedule guilt-free play activities as the top priority. Then he actually limits the amount of work they are allowed to do on their dissertation to only a couple of hours per day. The effect is quite amazing at turning students around from dreading and avoiding their dissertation to really trying to maximize the limited time they have to work on it. And having guilt-free play lets them really disconnect from the work and have true recovery so that they have the motivation and energy to hit the project again and again every day. Seems counter-intuitive at first, but as I&#39;ve applied this to different projects, it&#39;s amazing how much more I&#39;m able to accomplish.[1] https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/15799151-daily-rituals[2] https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/95708.The_Now_Habit"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"One of the more interesting sayings I have come across lately is: People overestimate how much they can get done in the short term but they underestimate how much they can get done in the long term.I see this all the time with friends who pick up the guitar as a hobby. Often someone practices intensely for one week or one month and then gets frustrated at their progress. That frustration often causes people to give up. Now I see it as a mismatch between short-term estimation/expectations. The frustration is caused by overestimating how much progress they think they should make in the short-term. The quitting is caused by underestimating the progress they could make in the long term."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This was exactly how we built OwnLocal before we quit our day jobs.  In a sense, it was very easy because when you don&#39;t know how big the problem is, everything feels like progress.Now I see 40 barreling towards me and it&#39;s hard to just do a little bit every day.  Because I have experience, I can form a much bigger picture of an idea in my head and it&#39;s hard to peel off a tiny bit and make that feel like a success.This curses me in my startup attempts but it also curses me in my work.  It&#39;s hard to think like a founder anymore.  I always overspec projects because I can easily guess what demons lie on the horizon.I miss my early startup days when I could just write some code every day and feel successful.  I want that back."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Very nice. I like these tutorials showing the nuts and bolts of wasm and C without just throwing it at  emscripten toolchain.I&#39;m curious if there&#39;s perf differences between canvas and webgl canvas. This project uses just canvas, but iirc passing frames to be rendered by webgl is faster. Perhaps I&#39;m wrong in this context.I also don&#39;t see threading in here. Makes sense for a demo, but if this were to be used performantly you&#39;d have to throw it all in a webworker so it doesn&#39;t block the main thread. This is one point of contention with wasm because it&#39;s not straightforward to render to a canvas/webgl on the main thread from a worker thread. OffscreenCanvas is one workaround but not supported by FF or safari."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Just a point for the first chapters: you are not required to run your own local server (even if things push in that direction)You can include the wasm as an ArrayBuffer or as a base64 encoded string and hardcode it in the javascript.

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;ve tried to find the actual court decision, best match seems to be 4 W 118/21 (enter on https://www.justiz.sachsen.de/esamosplus/pages/index.aspx under &#34;Aktenzeichen&#34; &amp; click &#34;suchen&#34;, can&#39;t see any obvious way to link the PDF...)However, that document does not actually order a fine.  It warns about imposing one (&#34;up to 250&#39;000€&#34;) if Youtube doesn&#39;t remedy the problem.  Considering it&#39;s now exactly 3 months later (decision dates April 13th), that lines up.From what I understand (not a lawyer, yadda yadda) this is a purely civil matter and doesn&#39;t really go as far as some statement on free speech.  The issue discussed mostly seems to revolve around which terms of service are valid and how they can be changed."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"When I was around twenty my Mom used to call me every other day or so just to have a chat. One day, after she asked me how my day was, I shot back something along the lines of: &#34;I don&#39;t have anything to tell you, really. You&#39;re calling so often that nothing new manages to happen in between the calls.&#34; So, she stopped calling. I would go home every other week as usual and everything seemed fine. It was only much later that I found out that she basically cried for three days straight after that call.Some time later there was a period when I would contact my parents every few months or so. Not really on purpose. Simply because other things simply took more of my time and attention, and calling my parents wasn&#39;t really high on my list of priorities.Only when my son was born I started to realize what someone goes through as an individual and as a couple once a child comes into their lives. How it changes things. That not being thrown out of the window at 2 a.m. as an infant is already a blessing. I&#39;m sure that thought has crossed the mind of many a young parent with a screeching infant on their hands in the middle of night. So, I felt ashamed of myself, and grateful to my parents for being there in the first place, and being decent at being parents as well.Now I&#39;ve made a point to myself to call them up at least once a week. As in, I have set up a reminder for that. I now know how much they value this. But it&#39;s not only for them. I realize very well that one day I will wake up and wish to call my parents to have a chat about something. But there simply won&#39;t be anyone to call anymore.I&#39;m not passing any judgement at all on people who have abusive parents. I have no idea how that feels like. I&#39;m just happy that I didn&#39;t end up accidentally getting estranged to the decent parents that I have. At some point it really was going that way."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"We&#39;re all living that Asian family joke.Parents spend their whole lives waiting for their kids to thank you.  Kids spend their whole lives waiting for their parent to say &#34;I&#39;m sorry.&#34;That said I&#39;ve never felt that way about my Mom and Dad.  I&#39;ve faults and problems a plenty but I wouldn&#39;t ascribe any of that on them; indeed the best things about me seem to clearly come from them and the worst are just as clearly things they suggested I not do.  What are you going to do though, even if all that wasn&#39;t true they&#39;d still love me and I&#39;d still love them."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Wonder how much of this is driven by social media and the internet today. The word &#39;Toxic&#39; is just thrown around now and everything is &#39;Toxic&#39;. Its a word that has ceased to have any real meaning but virtually every behavior that used to just be normal every day activity is Toxic. Everyone has flaws and no one has all the answers. Parents are just people doing the best they can and for the most part making what they think are the best decisions in the moment while struggling with everything that everyone else struggles with. Children want to put their parents on a pedestal and assume that all decisions; and any harm caused was intentional. There are of course bad parents and bad people and I don&#39;t mean to discount the effect that those people have on their kids. Social media is quick these days to tell you that your parents are narcissists when in reality they are just distracted trying to figure out what happened to their lives and trying to get by. At the end of every day I look back and see choices I made that were probably not great or see where I ignored my kid as I was trying to get something done for work. These things pile up and then are focused through the lens of the internet and suddenly you are a bad parent."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I used to be of the mind that ad tech et. al. weren’t really hurting anyone, and that the more extreme examples of privacy offenses were simple edge cases.That is until I switched to iOS and was given the option to hide my true email address, tell an app not to track me, and otherwise get visibility into just how much my data is getting sniffed for stupid reasons that have nothing to do with the service I’m using."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"It&#39;s easy to mock the pettiness of all parties described here, and it&#39;s common for people on this forum to take absolutist stances with regards to privacy/advertising, but it&#39;s also important to recognize that these arguments will actually define the future of the internet for the average user.There are trillion dollar companies on both sides of the argument, and their eventual compromise will establish the defaults for billions of users.There are also two fundamental components of the Big Tech debate at odds with each other here - privacy and competition. Increasing privacy decreases competition by strengthening the Big Tech companies that engage with users at the platform/browser/OS/hardware level. See: Google&#39;s removal of third-party cookies from Chrome in the name of privacy was just blocked by EU competition regulators, because it would cripple competing advertising companies[1].[1] https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2021/06/eu-antitrust-reg..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Funny how there is no (meaningful) user representation at W3C.  Perhaps Wendy Seltzer is the closest to a user representative.  A lawyer who is a Perl programmer, according to her Wikipedia profile.The arguments against Big Tech the smaller ad tech folks are raising sound legit, but obviously they are not being made in good faith.  Big Tech has no more respect for user privacy than companies like Rosewell&#39;s.  They are all a threat to user privacy.  Companies that make browsers should not also be taking in online ad services revenue.  It is a clear conflict of interest.51degrees provides the public with a CSV list of user-agents, e.g., for use in browser fingerprinting (or perhaps user defence against browser fingerprinting).  What does Google provide.  We know they are fingerpringing on a mass scale.  There is zero transparency.https://raw.githubusercontent.com/51Degrees/Device-Detection...Just for fun, I periodically compile w3c-libwww.  It still compiles and it still works today. I use it through a TLS-enabled proxy.  It reminds me of all the potential for experimetation the www once had.  Today the web just looks like a Big Tech-led surveillance dystopia slowly coming together.  Unless someone stops it.  Lina Khan, godspeed.The disputes described in the article with lawyers from W3C and IAPP looking on reminds me a little of the formation of ICANN back in the 1990&#39;s and the disputes over domain names versus trademarks."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"It is open source software and it can reverse engineer programs from a lot of different systems.Some people may be worried about installing a piece of software on their computer that comes from the NSA. I don&#39;t think that there are real reasons to worry. One of the tasks of the NSA is defending against cyber attacks. Having more people with good tools helps the defense. Also, you can be pretty certain that some security people have been closely looking at the sources to see if it contains any suspicious features. Besides, if the NSA really wants to install some software on your computer, they can probably do it themselves without your involvement."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"If you want to harness the power of Ghidra decompiler but without the need of installing Java - Rizin[1][2] and Cutter[3][4] (Rizin&#39;s Qt GUI) integrate Ghidra&#39;s decompiler part that is written in C++ (libdecomp) as plugin - rz-ghidra[5]. We work currently on improving the integration and the quality of output.[1] https://rizin.re[2] https://github.com/rizinorg/rizin[3] https://cutter.re[4] https://github.com/rizinorg/cutter[5] https://github.com/rizinorg/rz-ghidra"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I used this again just the other day with the cantor.dust plugin. My rev.eng skills are dull and were never great to begin with, but for anything below a real APT with obfuscation, runtime decoding and unpacking, Ghidra is an equalizer.  Between this and Chef from gchq, someone with devops skills can probably skill up to an entry level threat analyst level in a few weeks or months. The tooling available today is really good.If people are worried about running systems backdoored by NSA, they probably shouldn&#39;t use things like electricity either. It&#39;s a threat actor you can&#39;t really do anything about."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Twitter is great when it comes to transparency. I love how they included this&gt;Although we built Fleets to address some of the anxieties that hold people back from Tweeting, Fleets are mostly used by people who are already Tweeting to amplify their own Tweets and talk directly with others. We’ll explore more ways to address what holds people back from participating on Twitter. And for the people who already are Tweeting, we’re focused on making this better for you.It&#39;s always nice to know why an experiment/project failed. They didn&#39;t have to explain it, but they did and I thought it was a nice touch."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Kudos to Twitter for pulling the plug on a high profile feature that wasn&#39;t working out.I saw some reasonably interesting Fleets at first, but it quickly devolved into a low-effort self promotion feature as they noted:&gt; Although we built Fleets to address some of the anxieties that hold people back from Tweeting, Fleets are mostly used by people who are already Tweeting to amplify their own TweetsEventually I stopped clicking on them because I knew I&#39;d see the Tweets during my normal scrolling anyway. I suppose this problem is inherent to Twitter, where Tweets are already low effort enough that they didn&#39;t need another feature for rapid-fire, low-effort content. Contrast with Instagram where people&#39;s posts are generally well thought out, but their stories are made for rapid-fire content.Twitter didn&#39;t have the same divergence, so Fleets and Tweets became the same content in different formats. And of course, the Twitter self-promoters took full advantage of a feature that let them bubble their content to the literal top of people&#39;s feeds."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; Although we built Fleets to address some of the anxieties that hold people back from Tweeting, Fleets are mostly used by people who are already Tweeting to amplify their own Tweetsthis is exactly my problem with Twitter. It&#39;s an even bigger echo chamber than FB. As much as I try, I can&#39;t seem to escape the oversaturated bubble of a handful of extremely loud mouthed tweeters and their ardent followers. Mix in the toxic conversations, and it&#39;s definitely not a place I feel comfortable discussing anything."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"The infancy period of this technology is fascinating.Think about computer graphics 15 years ago. Beowulf came out in 2007, and was developed in the preceding years- let&#39;s call it 15+ years old. And it was right there in the uncanny valley where it didn&#39;t look real, but it looks realistic. It was interesting visually, but my brain told me &#34;this isn&#39;t correct&#34;.And now some modern game engines are doing more realistic rendering than that in real-time.Now look at these generative models. Some state of the art ones with humans helping are pretty convincing, but it&#39;s slow work. The more general ones like these are making these wonderfully interesting images that our brains immediately say &#34;That&#39;s not correct&#34;.But where will this technology be in another 15 years? I think the possibilities for entertainment are really interesting. Imagine a D&amp;D game where the GM is vocally telling the AI what to generate, then making small tweaks, and the players are seeing the results."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Long-time user here.  Laying out newsletters, flow charts, diagrams, and figlets.  It has very few issues these days, and only a couple minor points of frustration in the UI.  For my purposes, it&#39;s the best thing out there.A couple of workflow tips for using Monodraw:* Open a few docs in Monodraw at a time and leave them open for your different needs: text boxes, figlets, diagrams.  Each with a few elements already waiting to be filled, cut &amp; pasted, etc.* For larger docs (e.g. newsletters) finish the writing in your text editor and bring it into Monodraw.  Think Publisher or InDesign.  Yeah, you can edit in here, but it&#39;s weird.  Best for layout.* Browse the sample file that opens by default when you load Monodraw.  Good fodder in there.* Snippets!* Yes, it is just text but there is FILL to give order (front to back) of elements.  This is really handy for making slides that expose a list one item at a time.* Cut and Paste chunks in and out of your Monodraw file with your main document or take a clipped screen capture for dropping into a graphic or fancy format document (e.g. Illustrator).  No need to export and paste."</p>

Our elected officials should be structuring new frameworks for social media companies to operate within. We’re entering a new era with outdated laws."</p>
