								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"If you&#39;re asking about services too: Yandex Market. It&#39;s like Google Product Search that is actually successful and widely used for searching for specific products, or Amazon that doesn&#39;t swindle you left and right.It&#39;s basically just a large catalog of products, filled by third-parties a-la Amazon now, only it didn&#39;t sell anything itself (until recently). Instead, it had detailed characteristics for a lot of products, with corresponding filters in the catalog; and good user reviews. Since Yandex is good at dealing with unstructured text, even poor data exports by vendors end up organized decently on the service. Since Yandex had millions of users on its other services, they all could leave reviews without much hassle. And since Yandex is primarily a search engine, it knows when a bogus review is spammed across the web.Alas, it&#39;s only available in Russian since it works with Russian shops. Every time I need to look for a product on the English web, I lament that there&#39;s no service that is quite that solid. Amazon has filters, but search results usually look like simply a bit better Aliexpress. In regard to Google Product Search I don&#39;t even know anything particular—I tried to use it a couple times, and my general impression is that it... exists. Not much else."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"There&#39;s a home automation protocol that&#39;s been around for over 20 years called KNX. It&#39;s backed by big names (ABB, Hager, Gira, Osram, Mean Well) however outside of Germany it&#39;s pretty much unknown. Compared to ZigBee or Z-Wave it&#39;s wired and the config is stored in the devices themselves, so there&#39;s no single point of failure. It has strict certification requirements so you can be guaranteed that products from different manufacturers will work together (this does mean its more expensive though). The quality of the hardware (esp. motion/presence sensors) is a lot better than what you can buy from Amazon or the &#39;smart home&#39; section in your local Walmart.There&#39;s plenty of content (in German) on YouTube about it, and forums:https://m.youtube.com/channel/UCiCPbFz0Ld6mera2fNDRWzwhttps://knx-user-forum.de/"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I&#39;ve found my experience designing gearboxes for Boeing has applicability to software design. For example, the fundamental idea with airplane design is not to design components that cannot fail, as that is impossible. The idea is to design the system to be tolerant of failure. Every part in the system is not &#34;how can we make this part never fail&#34; but &#34;assume it failed. How does the airplane survive?&#34;This is a fundamental shift in viewpoint.It seems pretty well established that making secure software is impossible. Time to pivot to designing software systems that are tolerant of inevitable security breaches.One example of this is compartmentalization. A single breach must not have access to all the sensitive data. Another is backups must be air gapped (or put on physically read-only media) so ransomware cannot compromise them.Compartmentalization is used in battleship design, aircraft design, spy networks, etc. Time to use it in software systems design.P.S. Just to be clear, one still strives to design airplane parts so they won&#39;t fail, it&#39;s just that one does not rely on them never failing.P.P.S. It&#39;s really really hard to sink a battleship as they are so compartmentalized. See the sinking of the Bismarck and the Yamato."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Largest impact, sure. But architecturally it was a relatively simple formula - compromise a widely used package and sleep on it until it was pervasive enough to be a valuable hack. I disagree with this being the most sophisticated though. Unless I&#39;m missing something about this hack, the Stuxnet[1] architecture, complexity, and long term planning feel far more sophisticated than the SolarWinds hack.[1] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stuxnet"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I mean, it&#39;s 100% going to happen again, and it was plainly obvious it was going to happen to begin with. We did a Black Hat talk about this (checks notes) 14 years ago, after being paid by a client to audit something like 12 different agent-based management systems:https://web.archive.org/web/20061215050427/http://www.matasa...Agent-based endpoint management is super convenient and is mainstream in modern IT management. But nobody grows up wanting to write the communications software for enterprise server inventory software, so the code quality on these products, which are ubiquitous, is awful. But 99% of enterprise buyers aren&#39;t even slightly motivated by software security when making purchasing decisions, and everyone knows it, so vendors buy fig-leaf audits from vendors who will sell public-facing documents for 2p1w engagements, and IT purchasers, whose performance reviews are based on completing projects and not protecting their companies from $500,000 purchase orders for what is effectively malware, accept those bogus reviews and get on with their lives.Nothing is going to change about this, because nothing is going to alter the incentives. Reporters like Nicole Perlroth will try to blame it on ex-NSA hired guns (as if you needed the exploit chains NSA buys to break any of these systems), but I can&#39;t think of any realistic policy that could be applied to stop these kinds of attacks, not without massively disrupting the technology industry at the same time.Best get used to it, is I guess my point. I mean that sincerely, not as a sort of appeal to right the ship; the ship is already upside down."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Israel feels like the only nation taking the importance and urgency of vaccination seriously.Here in Europe, articles are coming out complaining that the slow vaccination could be harming the economy which, well, fucking duh. (https://www.brusselstimes.com/news/belgium-all-news/154626/c...)Fast rollout. Involve pharmacies. Involve the army. Distribute widely and efficiently. Prepare for months before the vaccine is here. Follow-up campaign to convince vax holdouts. A real War Effort.There&#39;s barely any calls for volunteering here in Belgium. Hospitals and vaccination centers will complain to the government that they are understaffed but you seldom hear them urgently asking for new volunteers to assign to COVID teams and vaccination centers. We spent a ton of time debating whether the social bubble should be 2 or 3 large, whether kids should be 12 or 14 before they count for it, etc etc and those spending that time were the same people who didn&#39;t prepare for the eventuality of a vaccine, and started doing so in late December.Sorry this has veered off topic. The number of articles that can be summed up to &#34;Vaccines work, are good, and israel is doing it right&#34; frustrate little european me. :("</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The vaccine has 95% efficacy in initial controlled trials. It is almost impossible to reach (within 1%) of that same level of effectiveness in the real world as claimed here. The real world has a big chunk of the population with an immune system that doesn&#39;t respond nearly as well to the vaccine (such as the elderly).Here is an overview of an Israeli study that was finding a more realistic effectiveness of 70% https://dalewharrison.substack.com/p/israeli-vaccination-dat...If anyone has a link to the actual study, please post it! It is really annoying to see news articles posted about studies that don&#39;t link to them or even provide any basic information to find the study."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Related fun (and sad) fact: In Norway, the tax submission forms are online and so user friendly that you don&#39;t need a tax filing program like this. Edit: Here is a link to an explanation for the form, in English, which was revamped in 2020: https://www.skatteetaten.no/en/person/taxes/tax-return/tax-r...The submission form is essentially a wizard that asks you questions related to your situation and your past year. Depending on your answers, it expands different parts of the form. Other parts, such as tax exempt donations are automatically filled out based on information that the recipients filled out for you.I visited the UX department of the Norwegian equivalent to the IRS (Skatteetaten), and they had almost every device you could think of (eye-tracking being the most fun). No wonder they made good forms.I understand that some people object politically to taxes, but as long as it&#39;s one of the certainties of life (death being the other), I cannot understand why filling out the submission seems so hard in most countries..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is really cool, and I&#39;d like to encourage work like this. I currently don&#39;t think I can recommend this to others because:It isn&#39;t immediately obvious who is running the site. whois info lists a Canadian privacy company. The site doesn&#39;t have an about page. Github has contributor info, which may help. Tax returns need to be private and accurate. If it&#39;s hard to verify that the authors are even in the US, it&#39;s had to know if this is a scam.I think the project is still young, and the above is likely something addressable. Partnering with some accountants may be a way to fund further development/maintenance through referrals. Good luck!"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I&#39;ve brought this up before, but I wonder if a &#34;JS constraint spec&#34; could be added to the JS standard that guarantees against this sort of (already uncommon) dynamic behavior in certain cases, so that code can be more aggressively optimized when possibleIf you&#39;re already using TypeScript to constrain your code, why couldn&#39;t it generate interpreter/compiler hints?These could take the form of a language-agnostic metadata file, similar to source maps, that optionally ships alongside the JS bundleEdit: Several people have misunderstood, so I must not have articulated this well. What I meant was not a new/stricter subset of JS that forbids certain dynamic behaviors across the board. What I&#39;m talking about is having TypeScript (or otherwise), which knows things at compile-time about how specific pieces of code are and are not called, manifest this information in a way that V8 can digest and act on directly, for that specific codebase. V8 already tries to guess this information and uses it to decide which things to optimize and how, but it&#39;s treating the JS bundle as a black box even though in many cases, an earlier stage of the pipeline already had this information on-hand and threw it away.In addition to being more granular, this (like TypeScript itself) would allow parts of a codebase to continue being fully dynamic while other parts are well-constrained."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I’ve been coding JS for a decade. Nowadays I wish JS was simpler. I’m fine with ES6 syntactic sugar. I just want the language to do be stricter, safer and faster. I don’t want to transpile TS into JS. Just make JS strict with monomorphic types.One thing that really impressed me is how crazy fast golang is. Not just at runtime but compile time too. Esbuild is like 20x faster than webpack. That’s nuts. I see a webserver running on 512MB ram and single core, serving 10s of thousands of requests a second without batting an eye. Just rock solid reliability and performance.I want to build web apps with low memory, cpu, and bandwidth profile. Give us a simpler language that doesn’t need crazy complicated hotspot profiling JITs. Just make the default, simple thing insanely fast.Give us better fundamental primitives that don’t need a gajillion build tools.The JS ecosystem is so complicated nowadays. It just seems we’re patching shit on top of each other without reasoning from first principles.Disclaimer: I am not saying this specific improvement isn&#39;t worth it. I love v8, but I feel we can make magnitudes of higher performance gains by removing things and simplifying such that you don&#39;t even need top level complex optimizations."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"By putting the number of arguments onto the stack, we end up making the stack larger for every single function call.   We also require every access to any stack variable to do math to figure out where on the stack it&#39;s arguments are.That seems an insane overhead for the common case...  If this really does make benchmarks faster overall, it suggests an even better solution might exist out there that does not add overhead for the common case...Perhaps it might be worth keeping track of how many arguments a function is typically called with, and recompiling code for each case?    Then all the checks for argument counts can be entirely removed in the optimized code."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Salary is a negotiation between parties. Looked at soberly, you&#39;re the business, your employer is your customer, and the salary they pay you is really the price you charge for your services.They have no obligation to pay more for your services than they think they have to, compared to alternatives on the market. And you have no obligation to charge less for your services than you can get from other &#34;customers&#34;. Either of you can negotiate the price up or down, and the other is free to take it or leave it.It&#39;s not about who &#34;deserves&#34; what. It&#39;s a simple negotiation, like every other business transaction.The more valuable (and less replaceable) your services are, the more pay you can successfully negotiate for. I guarantee you there are plenty of people at these &#34;location-based pay&#34; companies who&#39;ve negotiated for considerably higher pay than others in their location. Just as there are many businesses (e.g. Apple) who&#39;ve found a way to charge more for their products than their competitors have.So it&#39;s worth learning to negotiate. And, perhaps more importantly, it&#39;s worth learning to provide massive value that&#39;s hard to replace. Or accepting the tradeoffs if you choose not to.Let&#39;s say you mould your skillset to fit perfectly into a commonly-open job description: front-end software engineer. Well great, the benefit is you have lots of jobs you can apply for, so you can easily &#34;fire&#34; one company to go work at another. The downside is you&#39;re now in direct competition with a million other people who&#39;ve shaped themselves to have the same common skillset, so it&#39;s easier for companies to fire you. Competition drives prices down and makes you more easily replaceable. But it gives you some safety due to redundancy. That&#39;s often a reasonable tradeoff to make, but you should be aware you&#39;re making it. If you want the big bucks, it helps to be rarer, and to work at places and in roles where it&#39;s easier to demonstrate your value."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"As a Bangladeshi, I can tell you that the workers in my country don&#39;t have proper unions. They can&#39;t negotiate. Salary is the last thing on their minds, they can&#39;t even negotiate safe working conditions. They are uneducated, so they don&#39;t know what they deserve. See here -&gt; https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2012_Dhaka_garment_factory_fir...So, the cheap stuff that you&#39;re getting is because someone is getting a super bad deal, by exploiting the heck out of workers. Same in China.The garments factory owners are walking away with tonnes of money, leaving the workers high and dry.The more _subtle_ point that the author is making, is that, &#34;wait, if people realize that they can get awesome developers in developing nations for a lower price, I&#39;m not going to get hired any more in my over-priced city&#34;.Good, move to a place where your salary is worth more, and work to enrich that community. Why should SF and NY get all the benefits of economic growth?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"If you&#39;re running a remote company, there&#39;s another reason (besides fairness) that location-based pay is a bad idea: it makes it harder to create a compensation structure that incentivizes high performance.If Person A is outperforming Person B, but is getting paid less because they happen to live somewhere else, you lose the ability to claim that you compensate people for performance without sounding like you&#39;re talking out of both sides of your mouth. Not only is Person A not going to be happy about that, Person A is not going to believe that compensation at your company is based on performance.Companies that want to hire and incentivize the best people need to be congruent in their messaging around compensation and performance. Claiming that compensation is performance-based and then including a factor (location) that has no bearing on performance is incongruent and will not help to develop the right culture in this regard."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This I don&#39;t understand: Seems like whenever functional paradigms are discussed, the whole same stuff is always repeated without failure: on one hand fuzzy generalizations like &#34;pure functions&#34;, &#34;no side effects&#34;, &#34;no state&#34;...  on the other, all examples always talking about using map, filter, fold, flat, zip. One would think that &#34;functional programming&#34; _is_ using those functions. That FP is all about Iterators and what things you can do with them.But I never see contrived real-world examples, those that really show how things are different from imperative or procedural programming. I want to see how you use stateless functional programming to control a garage door actuator. Or how you model a Car which can have their doors open or closed either by the class itself or external actors. How do you receive UDP packets, including a buffer implementation that is able to sort out-of-order packets and send retransmission requests for missing ones? That kind of stuff.Are there any resources that show these kind of &#34;here is a list of problems, how they are typically solved, and how you could solve with FP&#34; style examples?EDIT: This message was actually to say thank you and that TFA is an awesome resource to help understand how the Iterator methods work! And then I got lost in my semi-rant and forgot to actually say thanks :)"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"This reminds me of the tree diagrams I wrote during the Term Rewriting Systems course at the Vrije Universiteit [1].Functional programming really started to resonate with me at that time. Properties like confluence were very useful to understand distributed systems algorithms later on, and e.g. how eventual consistency plays out.[1] The teacher was awesome too. If you&#39;d like to learn more about term rewriting systems, go take a peek at his slides http://joerg.endrullis.de/teaching/#trs (Note, just noticed that they are behind a password. A gentle email will probably get you the slides though :)"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"If you read the trial data this is a foregone conclusion. The Moderna vaccine produces antibody titres over twice as high as an actual infection from the data I&#39;ve seen.My theory is that these companies knew they only had one chance to make a working vaccine, so they did everything they could to make it not fail. Double doses, 5x what was needed in monkeys, gold standard adjuvants.I would not be amazed in the slightest if they decide to half-dose the vaccine or do away with the second shot or even both. They probably didn&#39;t have time to run the trial any other way"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"So many people in the comments are just certain that more money wouldn&#39;t have made any difference to vaccine production, and that economic considerations had nothing to  do with it. The arguments they make fail to simple comparison tests:&#34;If we paid Tesla 2x as much per car, could they really not produce more cars?&#34;They also fail to privileging the status quo - &#34;If we paid Tesla half as much money, would they produce fewer cars?&#34;Obviously, they would. Money influences how easily they can produce cars.  At the margin there must be decisions related to turning money into efficiency every day. And the same thing must apply for vaccines.  The best vaccine expert in the world asked for a yearly sabbatical - 200k wasn&#39;t enough to keep them.  Double that to 400k?  Oh actually it can wait til next year.The question for people who deny money&#39;s ability to produce more vaccines is: why do you admit that any lower price for a vaccine would reduce supply - but you deny that any higher price would increase supply.  What magic is this?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The results in Figure 3 are certainly promising. Has anyone been able to find the mentioned supplementary material though?&gt; A post-hoc exploratory analysis of immunogenicity in subgroups of participants aged ≥55-&lt;65, ≥65-74 and ≥75 years was performed (Tables S6 and S7). Increases in levels of anti-SARS-CoV-2-spike bAb and nAb at days 29 and post-second vaccination at both the 50 and 100 ug doses were generally comparable across the age subgroups and with those observed in the younger (18-55 years) study participants. Seroconversion rates were also comparable across the age groups and with those in the younger participants. It should be noted that the small size of the ≥75 year-old subgroup (n=22) precludes definitive conclusions to be made.There doesn&#39;t seem to be any link to supplementary material at either the Elsevier page [1] nor the NIH page [2]. The clinical trial registration [3] suggests that there was an update just a few days ago, so perhaps they&#39;re just waiting to upload a new PDF?[1] https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0264410X2...[2] https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7871769/[3] https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/study/NCT04405076"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"A great response, in my opinion. Succinctly and effectively points out what was wrong with the NYT article, then tries to move on. Somewhat more of a sober tone than Scott&#39;s typical writing, but still with a dash of his typical wit:&gt; I don’t want to accuse the New York Times of lying about me, exactly, but if they were truthful, it was in the same way as that famous movie review which describes the Wizard of Oz as: “Transported to a surreal landscape, a young girl kills the first person she meets and then teams up with three strangers to kill again.”I have only gained respect for Scott, and lost respect for the NYT, throughout this while saga. Hopefully this is the end of it.Edit: in the spirit of moving on, here are two of my favorite articles since his return, one enlightening, one funny:&#34;WebMD, And The Tragedy Of Legible Expertise&#34; -- https://astralcodexten.substack.com/p/webmd-and-the-tragedy-...&#34;List of Fictional Cryptocurrencies Banned By The SEC&#34; -- https://astralcodexten.substack.com/p/list-of-fictional-cryp..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Steven Pinker maybe says it best, in a thread where he links to some notable SSC posts:A typical essay by Scott Alexander is deeper, better reasoned, better referenced, more original, and wittier than 99% of the opinion pieces in MSM. It&#39;s sad that the NYT can see him only through the lens of their standard political &amp; cultural obsessions.Perhaps Alexander&#39;s ultimate virtue is epistemic humility: His pieces are long, sometimes inconclusive, and accompanied by diverse commentary because he&#39;s committed to his own fallibility and lack of omniscience.  We should all live by such standards.https://twitter.com/sapinker/status/1360787817459253251"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The NYT article[1] can hardly be called a hit piece at all, considering how little &#39;dirt&#39; it actually contains.What is telling however is the lengths to which they went to connect Scott to anything negative at all.Look at how they &#39;connect&#39; him to Peter Thiel for instance: Scott is a prominent figure in a loose group of &#34;Rationalists&#34;. Some rationalists are concerned about AI. Some people who are concerned about AI also donated to MIRI. Guess who also donated to MIRI? Peter Thiel!The author then goes on to rattle off a bunch of other names who are in turn connected to Peter Thiel in some ways.Like... really?I just can&#39;t figure out why that paragraph should even be the article. Speaking of which, what is that article even about? If there&#39;s supposed to be some story or thread stringing it together, I can&#39;t see it.It&#39;s essentially:1. He deleted his blog.2. Here&#39;s a list of unrelated things people he may know have done.3. He now has a new blog.Cool story, NYT.[1]: https://archive.is/b1tyQ"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Neat concept.  Exploring the difference between what successfully compiles vs. what won&#39;t seems like a great way of getting more familiar with the language.I&#39;ve written a little over 1,000 lines of Zig at this point and I really like it.  I think its key feature is a rich compile-time imperative programming environment (&#34;comptime&#34;).  If you can have full compile-time imperative code execution, you can get a lot of the benefits of more complicated language features (like C++ templates) &#34;for free.&#34;In C++ templates are &#34;a language within a language&#34;, but even templates with all their complexity cannot solve all of the problems you might want to solve at compile-time, so C++ has been gradually expanding its compile-time code execution features so that more and more of the language is available at compile-time (constexpr, consteval, etc). Zig jumps straight to the finish line by making most of the language available at compile-time from the outset, and in doing so avoids the need to add the complexity of templates in the first place.Having &#34;slices&#34; as a first class type feels like a general and powerful solution to the problems that std::string_view and std::span are trying to solve.I am comparing Zig to C++ a lot, which many Zig fans would probably take exception to as Zig does not aspire to be a better C++, but rather a better C.  Indeed many key C++ patterns like RAII are explicitly out of scope.  But to me Zig bridges the gap between C and C++ by solving many of the problems that make C feel too spartan without jumping to the incredible complexity of C++.There are a few things about Zig that give me pause.  I&#39;ve noticed that compile-time feels like a very lazy environment, meaning that functions do not seem to undergo full semantic analysis unless they are called from somewhere.  You can write a function that compiles successfully, leading you to believe the function is syntactically and semantically coherent, only to find that when you add an actual call to that function, the compiler now flags errors inside that function.  This adds some friction to development, because the act of writing a function is no longer a self-contained activity.  Writing the function feels more like sketching it; later when you actually call it you have a new set of compile errors to contend with.I also miss tools like ASAN to catch memory errors.  I&#39;m guessing things like that will come with time.Overall I feel very positive on Zig."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Heh fun: this was inspired by Rustlings, which in turn was inspired by NodeSchool.Mozilla Berlin used to host NodeSchool and the Rust Hack &amp; Learn evenings. It became a bit of a hang spot, and at some point we had a pretty consistent group of folks who&#39;d go to both. Marisa realized Rust could use something similar to NodeSchool, and started hacking on Rustlings during these evenings — which now a few years later has really taken off!It&#39;s really cool to now see other languages in turn be inspired and follow from Rustlings ^^"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I remember when GTA 3 came out on PC and I found just a simple human-readable text file you could edit to modify all the settings for all the cars.We turned the Karuma into a physics defying monster. It was 1000x heavier than the tank, so as you drove down the road other cars just bounced off and flew over the horizon, or exploded on impact.Yet it still did 0-100 in 0.1 seconds and could drive up walls.One time we jumped it from the third island, over the middle island and landed on a skyscraper roof on the 1st island.From there we spent about an hour dropping grenades on police cars and the army who had no way to reach us up there.Fun times.

There are two major things we could use help with:- the games do not run particularly well on the raspberry pi (any version really) and I have a feeling it&#39;s at least partially due to the OpenGL layer. We could really use someone with how to optimize OpenGL (especially on the pi).- physics have always been wonky beyond 30fps.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I am not surprised that the cost of context switching due to I/O readiness can often be roughly equal between async tasks and kernel threads. Normal blocking I/O can be surprisingly efficient because of various factors, such as a reduced need for system calls.Think about it this way—if you have a user-space thread which wakes up due to I/O readiness, then this means that the relevant kernel thread woke up from epoll_wait() or something similar. With blocking I/O, you call read(), and the kernel wakes up your thread when the read() completes. With non-blocking I/O, you call read(), get EAGAIN, call epoll_wait(), the kernel wakes up your thread when data is ready, and then you call read() a second time.In both scenarios, you’re calling a blocking system call and waking up the thread later.Of course, there are scenarios when epoll_wait() returns multiple events, which reduces the number of context switches. But the general result is that it’s not always easy to beat blocking I/O and kernel threads."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; People often see that there&#39;s some theoretical benefit of async and then they accept far less ergonomic coding styles and the additional bug classes that only happen on async due to accidental blocking etc... despite the fact that when you consider a real-world deployed application, those &#34;benefits&#34; become indistinguishable from noise. However, due to the additional bug classes and worse ergonomics, there is now less energy for actually optimizing the business logic, which is where all of the cycles and resource use are anyway, so in-practice async implementations tend to be buggier and slower.I disagree with this. I feel like using Async programming is actually much more powerfull and expressive than theaded programming, especially with Rust combinators on streams of futures (for examples: futures_unordered), which allow to trivially express complex concurrency patterns (such as: wait for the first two requests to return something and discard the third request&#39;s response, and btw also cancel that request). Async programming also allows for structured programming, where each task is an owned resource of a parent tasks, which means that lifetimes of tasks can be controlled and runaway threads can&#39;t exist (if one is avoiding tokio::spawn). I&#39;ve been developping [Garage](https://git.deuxfleurs.fr/Deuxfleurs/garage) for some time now (a simple distributed object store that implements a subset of S3, not ready for production!), and I&#39;ve been in awe about how easy it was to write these complex patterns using async Rust."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The throughput increase in I/O scenarios with many tasks is due to the number of supported concurrent processes and Little&#39;s law; it has little to do with context switching time, which has a negligible impact on the throughput in these use-cases: https://inside.java/2020/08/07/loom-performance/Low context switch latency only matters when the number of tasks is very small (their data all fits in the cache), and the workload is entirely computational. Otherwise, even the fastest implementation is ~60 ns, which is the cost of a cache-miss, and the compiler can&#39;t optimise things into a simple goto because the dispatch goes through a scheduler that has a megamorphic call-site.So memory is much more important for I/O use-case throughput, and while it is true that the kernel doesn&#39;t commit the full stack memory on thread creation, it&#39;s misleading to think that you get good memory usage. For one, once the memory is committed, it&#39;s never uncommitted (although it can be paged out). For another, the granularity is that of a page, i.e. at least 4K, which can often be much higher than what a task requires.&gt; It is hard to pin down exactly how the alleged advantages would arise.For I/O use-cases the answer is here:&gt; the async version uses about 1/20th as much memory as the threaded version.This could translate to 20x throughput -- due to Little&#39;s law -- although usually less because there are other limits, like network saturation."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"The Covid crisis has exposed a lot of the disaster in public education.  For many kids, the quality of education they receive is a function of the quality of the school and the quality of the teacher.  This is non-sensical.Kids can learn from online sources.  So why should someone&#39;s education be tied to their school district or teacher quality?I would love to have the local school system provide lab space, athletics, support services and one-on-one tutoring as necessary.But the bulk should be delivered online.  Sal Khan is comprehensive and brilliant, but perhaps someone out there is better at chemistry or art history.  Regardless, every kid should be exposed to the &#34;best&#34; teacher of the subject.  Why should a child&#39;s Algebra education be school or teacher dependent, when the best Algebra teacher on the planet is just 256kb/s away."</p>

https://usenetarchives.com/threads.php?id=comp.lang.c&amp;y=0&amp;r=...BTW.

In typical Usenet fashion, this triggered a huge thread, arguing over the appropriateness of the joke. Even Linus Torvalds got involved.Apparently Heathfield emailed Ritchie privately to apologize, and Ritchie&#39;s response is well known to anyone in clc: &#34;Usenet is a strange place.&#34;Original thread: https://groups.google.com/g/alt.folklore.computers/c/wbzzoyS...

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The fundamental challenge of GUIs is that they have state as a core concern. Unlike most systems, state is not an implementation detail that can be refactored away. It is central to the problem domain. The end user sees and cares about having a stateful system.The hardest part of dealing with state in a complex system is maintaining consistency in different places. Some instances of this this can be avoided by creating single-sources-of-truth, but in other cases you can&#39;t unify your state, or you&#39;re dealing with an external stateful system (like the DOM), and you have no choice but to find a way to keep separate pieces of state in sync.I should probably write a blog post on this"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Here is my personal opinion on it (not sure if it&#39;s the right one, though): Write the GUI independently of the model, let the GUI components update and communicate among each other as they like, and perform some validation in these GUI components. Translate between model and view only at one well-defined point at which there is also a final validation at the model side, and make sure model and view are only loosely coupled.Good GUIs have way too many requirements to be controlled (via a controller) by the model. As a typical example, the fact that a button should only be activated if there is data in a textbox has usually nothing to do with the underlying model. The model should only ever contain valid and consistent data."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is a great discussion on the challenges of designing UI for complex applications.In the aggregate, what ends up being most effective for me, is rapid prototyping, and “paving the bare spots.”[0]I find that I do a terrible job of predicting user mental models.The rub with prototypes, is that they can’t be lash-ups, as they inevitably end up as ship code. This means that a lot of good code will get binned. It just needs to be accepted and anticipated. Sometimes, I can create a standalone project for code that needs to go, but I still feel has a future.So there’s always a need for fundamental high quality.What has been useful to me, is Apple’s TestFlight[1]. I write Apple software, and TestFlight is their beta distribution system.I start a project at a very nascent stage, and use TestFlight to prototype it. I use an “always beta” quality approach, so the app is constantly at ship quality; although incomplete.It forces me to maintain high quality, and allows all stakeholders to participate, even at very early stages. It’s extremely motivating. The level of enthusiasm is off the charts. In fact, the biggest challenge is keeping people in low orbit, so they don’t start thinking that you are a “WIZZARD” [sic].It also makes shopping around for funding and support easy. You just loop people into the TestFlight group. Since the app is already at high quality, there’s no need for chaperones or sacrifices to The Demo Gods.I like that it keeps development totally focused on the actual user experience. They look at the application entirely differently from me.[0] https://littlegreenviper.com/miscellany/the-road-most-travel...[1] https://developer.apple.com/testflight/"</p>

I built something to upload markdown via ftp and copy a url with the filename as an argument to the clipboard. That url leads to a js renderer for markdown.- doing mp4 videosOnly downsides: a bit complex in the settings, wants to update often.- numbering tool to quickly ad step 1, 2,3 to screenshots."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Great tool! But be careful though.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This reminded - I noticed a while ago that being a computer science guy makes me think differently about physical storage and retrieval.For example - my wife likes &#34;shorts&#34; to be in one drawer and &#34;t-shirts&#34; in another. I like for one drawer to be &#34;workout clothes&#34; and have the mix of gym shorts and t-shirts. To me this feels &#34;obviously&#34; right because the use-case requires both items so why pay for two costly &#34;open drawer&#34; IOs?Similarly, she is very organized with her paper files, I just throw mine into a box. In the rare event I need something (eg when doing taxes) I don&#39;t mind scanning through the whole mess. Seems like a better strategy than making each &#34;write&#34; costly (neatly organizing) since writes are frequent and reads are rare.Anyone else like that?"</p>

The ideal would probably be if the device acts like a USB stick, with entries being shown as .bin/.txt files which can be manipulated in the normal ways.- How easy is it to create a backup? The ideal (for non-techies) would probably be something like plugging a device into a PC and simply copying files across.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Given the rather enormous of time and attention spent on it, not to mention the vast amounts of heated debate it had already spawned, I&#39;d sort of assumed the NYT would either publish a really, really solid article or (more likely) just spike it and try and forget the entire thing had ever happened. After all, given that the NYT was now so much a part of the story, writing anything good would be pretty hard.But no, kudos to them, they found a third way: Just write a poorly written article that alternates between interjecting disconnected ideas and making vague attempts at guilt by association, and carefully ignore anything inconvenient.&gt; He denounced the neoreactionaries, the anti-democratic, often racist movement popularized by Curtis Yarvin. But he also gave them a platform. His “blog roll” — the blogs he endorsed — included the work of Nick Land, a British philosopher whose writings on race, genetics and intelligence have been embraced by white nationalists.So he denounced the works of one person who believes bad things, but he also linked to a second person, who may or may not believe bad things, but is liked by a third group of people who also believe bad things, so...logically...that must mean he actually does...support the first person? Despite denouncing them, because he didn&#39;t link to them, which proves...something...?It feels weird even writing this argument down. If you link to someone who supports X, then you&#39;re actually supporting every other person who has ever supported X? Link to a pro-vegan website, you must support every terrible ideology that has had at least one vegetarian supporter?What a depressing waste of everyone&#39;s time."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Such a badly-written, mean-spirited article. A typical paragraph has a few ominous claims, which, when you read the links, aren&#39;t supported at all, nor connected in the way they&#39;re suggested to. Such as :&gt; In one post, he aligned himself with Charles Murray, who proposed a link between race and I.Q. in “The Bell Curve.” In another, he pointed out that Mr. Murray believes Black people “are genetically less intelligent than white people.”And when you read the linked page[0], what Scott writes concerning Murrary seems perfectly inoffensive. He divides political views into quadrants, Competitive/Collective vs Optimistic/Pessimistic, then says &#34;The only public figure I can think of in the [Collective + Pessimistic quadrant] with me is Charles Murray.&#34; This is what is described as aligning himself with Murray. The paragraph makes Scott sound like a flaming racist. It&#39;s just totally dishonest writing. It&#39;s hard to believe they&#39;re arguing in good faith there, but who knows.The anonymity thing seems to have been well and truly discarded – flung in his face, more like. What did he do to them to deserve such treatment, such contempt?I did get one laugh, out of:&gt; “[Rationalists] are basically just hippies who talk a lot more about Bayes’ theorem than the original hippies,” said Scott Aaronson[0] https://slatestarcodex.com/2016/05/23/three-great-articles-o..."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&gt; Some types in Rust have specific limitations on what is considered a valid value, which may not cover the entire range of possible memory values. We call any remaining invalid value a niche, and this space may be used for type layout optimizations. For example, in Rust 1.28 we introduced NonZero integer types (like NonZeroU8) where 0 is a niche, and this allowed Option&lt;NonZero&gt; to use 0 to represent None with no extra memory.I didn&#39;t know about this, and it&#39;s super cool. It&#39;s part of a broader pattern where the rigid constraints Rust can impose on code allow both the compiler and the user to do things that would be wildly dangerous in a less-strict language."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I don&#39;t use Rust often (sadly), but I really appreciate its goals and its steady progress. I read every one of these Rust 1.x stories on HN. Around Christmas I made an n-player chess clock with Rust and websockets [0] (because my friends are really slooow Agricola players :-), and it was incredibly easy compared to my first projects 5 years ago. I can&#39;t believe it&#39;s been that long. So thank you to all the folks working on it, and also thank you to everyone helping out 5-year newbies like me. Especially steveklabnik, I think you&#39;ve helped me personally several times. :-)[0] https://github.com/pjungwir/multiclock"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;ve been doing Rust for a while now, but this is the first time I&#39;ve heard about the niche concept[1]. Sounds really useful.I know that other languages have subranges or refinement types but niches seem to solve a different problem - namely to use the &#34;holes&#34; in a data type for optimization. Does any other language have some comparable concept to niches in Rust?"</p>

Have contact with relatives &#34;on the ground&#34;.My own experience: Don&#39;t ever trust the Chinese government on issues that could potentially involve the reputation of the party. Note that I&#39;m not saying don&#39;t trust what CCP says, ever (sometimes they actually do good things) - just not on issues that involve anything to do with how the world might perceive them.Which is exactly what this issue is about.That&#39;s not to say we have compelling evidence that this was a lab virus, either. I think, for me, it&#39;s a, &#34;we don&#39;t know, but I wouldn&#39;t be shocked at all if it was a lab virus&#34;."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I don&#39;t know whether SARS-CoV-2 escaped from a lab. But if it did, then not only is it probably not the first lab-origin pandemic, but it&#39;s also not the first time the WHO initially excluded that possibility.The 1977 Russian Flu pandemic was genetically near-identical to a strain from 1950, without the expected mutations that should have appeared after 27 years of undetected circulation among humans or animals. It&#39;s been widely suspected in mainstream literature to have escaped from a research or vaccine manufacturing accident, to the point that the NEJM casually wrote:&gt; The reemergence was probably an accidental release from a laboratory source in the setting of waning population immunity to H1 and N1 antigenshttps://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMra0904322But at the time, the WHO said:&gt; Laboratory contamination can be excluded because the laboratories concerned either had never kept H1N1 virus or had not worked with it for a long time.https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2395678/pdf/bul...And it&#39;s absolutely bizarre to me that people are asking why the origin even matters. After thousands of people died in Bhopal, did it matter whether better chemical safety standards could have prevented that? So with millions dead now, how could you possibly not wonder whether our current standards for the sampling and manipulation of poorly-understood pandemic-candidate viruses are adequate?"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"All the overthinking on motivations here is entertaining :)Disclosure: I&#39;m the Googler that got this funded. The process was roughly:- We have some extra budget at the end of the year! What are some ways we can spend this to get results while giving back to OSS?- Hey PSF, do you have any ideas for what you could do with some funding?- Looks good to me!We&#39;re just getting started, but we&#39;re working on ways to make this all more sustainable, scalable, and less ad-hoc.If you have ideas here, please reach out! I&#39;m dlorenc at google dot com, or join in the OpenSSF (openssf.org)!

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I used to try and raise funds for the UK pycon (I was very bad at it) and my biggest takeaway was that most devs were infavour of their company forking over some cash, but &#34;charity&#34; was a tough sell internally.  The best results was selling &#34;booths&#34; at the conference.  But that had more cost to the sponsor than just the cash we asked for.I have been mulling on Something that makes it less charity - purchasing a &#34;not really support&#34; option.  This might be a annual membership, in return for which you get ... early access to annual roadmap pdf.  Or an online video from the main devs explaining what they are doing for five minutes (#)What if there existed something to Make the above easy and simply to do - a small foundation who&#39;s job is to keep membership rolls and accept payments from companies on behalf of any foss project that signs up (it&#39;s something I imagine patreon could offer). They then ensure that the (minimal contract) is adhered to in some manner.(#) Seriously - you could set up a zoom call with 1-5 devs and just hit record once a year - I promise that 99% will see this as unbearable imposition and then talk for two hours.  And that&#39;s &#34;actionable paid insights into the future of this tool we depend on&#34;So the point being, if your FOSS project gets traction, then sign up to this foss-patreon, tell everyone to click to subscribe and you might might get a sponsor or two."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"A lot of people here are accusing Google of embrace, extend, and extinguish, but you have to realize that the incentives here are different from Big Tech&#39;s point of view. I&#39;d first like to point out Python is a programming language, not an internet standard or file format. It gets its utility merely from the ability to develop in it, even without an established ecosystem or network effect. The barrier to jump in, or fork off and start over is far lower compared to a browser or file format.So what&#39;s in it for Big Tech? Well, in a situation where controlling the technology or suppressing it is difficult due to the low costs of starting over, it is in their best interest to promote the ecosystem rather than control it. When they put in the time, money, and engineers to make it better the return on investment can be massive, because of the help they get from the community to grow, maintain, and keep compatible this core component at less cost than if they did it themselves.The incentives align and benefit everyone, especially if there is a fair governance system mediating between all parties involved. The biggest threat to an open source project is therefore not Big Tech collaboration, but project abandonment and lack of maintenance. I hope this makes everyone a little more optimistic about the direction of open source, especially as companies realize the real value it can have for all involved."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The argument of specialist vs generalist is futile. They simple fit in distinct parts of the journey and evolution of a software product.Generalists are highly valuable for many types of orgs and projects especially nascent projects. But sometimes you need the precise output of a specialist to achieve something.If my business has a product that is highly dependent of let&#39;s say OpenGL, then an OpenGL specialist will generate more specific output that someone who knows a little of OpenGL and a lot of other things.However, there&#39;s always the counterargument that generalists can compensate with their holistic view and understanding of problems throughout the whole stack. I understand this and agree with it, but I think there&#39;s a point in every innovation where the generalist contribution declines sharply. And I&#39;m saying this as a generalist.If you are a generalist and you feel undervalued, you&#39;re likely in the wrong project or too involved in phases of a project where your contribution can&#39;t move the needle significantly anymore."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"In my career, I have met exactly one short fat engineer with &gt;5yrs of exp that I was impressed by. That person is now a Product Manager at a FAANG company (albeit PM-ing highly technical stuff).I bring this up because I think there is a very good analogy to the point that the author is making and the distinction between PM and Engineers. Broadly put, PM&#39;s are good at figuring out the theta, and Engineers are good at the r.I think that with the perspectives that short fat engineers have, they can play enormous roles as &#34;PM&#34; or &#34;Engineering Manager&#34;, and definitely as ICs during early stages of startups. But they clearly don&#39;t enjoy depth, and this can be counter-productive for that 1% of the time where you really, really want depth.I don&#39;t buy the knowledge vs wisdom thing though, there&#39;s plenty of wisdom to be gained from going deep into a subject. I&#39;d actually claim that wisdom can only come from depth - though what depth means is different for different roles."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Chick Corea was a god.I learned Spain on the bass in the hopes that one day I could play my meager rendition for him. In a concert at SFJazz he picked people out of the audience to paint their portraits with his piano. How lucky was I to be placed upon such a seat where Chick dismembered me with his eyes, eviscerating my soul upon a platter. He stared at me with the eyes of a musician who had searched heaven and hell for the most tempestuous chordal mixtures. The two minutes I spent in that seat where he painted my portrait with his keystrokes are some of the most treasured moments of my life. I felt like I had been seen, chewed up, devoured, and reincarnated as the everloving Chick Corea sycophant I had always known myself to be.The man was a goddamn monster on the boards and we are all at a loss with his passing. Rest in Power Chick, you&#39;re in my heart forever."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The night I turned 18 I was drinking with Chick Corea.
It happened that in 1995 he had a classical music project involving some local orchestra musicians in Modena, Italy, where I was living at the time. One of the musicians was a friend of mine&#39;s brother who invited me to the dress rehearsal in a renaissance villa. Concert was good.After the concert, I got introduced to him and he asked me if I liked it. Shortly after I was drinking with him and others, and I turned 18 right there.:)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I am a huge fan of Chick Corea; he is my favorite jazz pianist.  I was saddened to hear this news this afternoon.  My very first jazz album outside of smooth jazz was “My Spanish Heart,” which was my introduction to jazz fusion.  I then discovered Return to Forever and the Elektric Band, and I also learned about Chick Corea’s post-bop work.  Chick Corea’s music has been a mainstay in my life for the past 15 years.  I love the playfulness of his piano playing and his compositions, which I feel is missing in a lot of music.  He has helped inspire me to play: I received an electronic wind instrument (EWI) for Christmas that I’ve been practicing.The jazz community lost a legend.  RIP Chick Corea."</p>

(maybe I am too cynical...).Overall, this is a fantastic index to some very interesting resources.There&#39;s an old saying that you learn more from failure than from success (whose analogue is a blogpost with a title &#34;look how easy it is to set up k8s in 15 minutes at home!&#34;).

During this ongoing process, my father, who’d been receiving chemotherapy treatments passed away.Being the “technical one” it fell to me to manage his various accounts. I logged into his gmail from the same browser I’d used LinkedIn, and started to contact people he knew but was out of touch with.The next day, I started receiving email, from my dead father, from LinkedIn. Claiming he’d just joined the service and wanted to connect to me.I still don’t have the words for this, years later.What exactly is wrong with these folks at LinkedIn?

If they pick up the phone, friend says:&#34;Good afternoon, Friend&#39;s Name, Your Name said you&#39;d be interested in my new social network, would you like to sign up?&#34;If you found out that this had happened, would you still be friends with this person?

Then LinkedIn started emailing people because I moused over their post and stuff. Some contact emailed me to ask what I needed from her and it was so weird.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"It&#39;s a shame. I had high hopes at the beginning that S4TF - and the investment in Swift from Google - would help Swift break out of the iOS ghetto and cement it as a mainstream language.Swift&#39;s a delightful language to use.  It has a lot of the nice things about Rust&#39;s type system, but is a heck of a lot easier to use at the expense of a bit of performance.  For a lot of use cases, I think this is a great value proposition.  ML/data science is a great example where practitioners could benefit from a more grown-up type system than what Python has on offer, but would still be able to keep low level details at arms length.I think Serverless would be another ideal use-case for Swift, where the productivity, clarity and correctness tools it offers would be a huge benefit.Some very interesting things came out of the S4TF project - like the work on autodiff, and python interop.  It&#39;s a shame the project never really seemed to get legs, it seems like it just languished for years with no clear direction.These days I do most of my work in Rust, and I&#39;m happy to do so because the tooling, community, and ecosystem is really amazing.  But there are a lot of language concepts and features I miss from swift.  I guess it goes to show that the governance and availability of a language have a lot more to do with adoption than the merits of the language itself."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Back when I was doing a lot of Swift programming, this seemed like such a great idea. Since then I moved on to Julia. And when I looked at the ML code for Swift and compared it to Julia, I was thinking &#34;How on earth could anyone think this was ever a good idea?&#34;Doing machine learning stuff in Julia is simply much more user friendly than doing the same in Swift. Swift is nice for iOS development, but I think in data science and Machine Learning Julia will always be a much better choice.It is a pity Google did not go for Julia. Julia has gotten exceptionally far despite limited resources. With Google style resources, Julia could have been massive.Despite modest investment, the Julia JIT beats almost anything out there. It would have been amazing to see what they could have pulled off if they had put the kind of resources that was put into the JavaScript V8 JIT into the Julia JIT.Julia uses a method JIT, which are quick to implement, but which makes latency gets bad. Meaning if you load a whole new package, running the first function can cause some delay. With a JavaScript style tracer JIT added into the mix one could have probably managed to have both high performance and low latency.Alternatively with more investment they could have had better precompile caching, meaning libraries that had been loaded in the past would JIT really fast. Julia does that today, but it could have worked a lot better than it currently does. It isn&#39;t that it can&#39;t be done, but it just requires resources."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"S4TF lost out, not to Python, but to Python&#39;s AI/ML ecosystem -- people, projects, libraries, frameworks.Despite its many shortcomings, Python has become the lingua franca of AI and ML, to the point that whenever I come across a newly published AI or ML paper that I find interesting, I expect to be able to find code implementing it in Python.For example, yesterday I saw a post on HN about approximating self-attention matrices in transformers, which have O(n²) computational cost, with a seemingly clever approach that has O(n) computational cost: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=26105455 . &#34;Huh, that looks interesting,&#34; I thought, &#34;let me see if I can find some code.&#34; Three clicks later, I found myself at https://github.com/mlpen/Nystromformer -- the official implementation... in Python. A few moments later, I was playing with this thingamajiggy. No other language comes close to having this kind of ecosystem in AI and ML.Julia still has a shot at becoming a viable alternative to Python, especially if the Julia developers can shorten the &#34;time to first interactive plot&#34; to make it as fast as Python&#39;s, but they face an uphill battle against such an entrenched ecosystem."</p>

That felt extremely unethical, as the information required to come to that conclusion was available far earlier in the process.And yet what am I going to do but use turbo tax again. The perceived risk and effort of using a non-automated system to fill them out doesn&#39;t seem worth the cost."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;ve been involved in many web scraper jobs over the past 25 years or so. The most recent one, which was a long time ago at this point, was using scrapy. I went with XML tools for controlling the DOM.It&#39;s worked unbelievably well. It&#39;s been running for roughly 5 years at this point. I send a command at a random time between 11pm and 4am to wake up an ec2 instance. It checks its tags to see if it should execute the script. If so, it does so. When it&#39;s done with its scraping for the day, it turns itself off.This is a tiny snapshot of why it&#39;s been so difficult for me to go from python2 to python3.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I&#39;m really tired of how much phone-home Apple products do these days.  At this point I don&#39;t even put a SIM in my phones any longer, and only permit them access via a travel router (which does have a SIM, for LTE backhaul) which runs a VPN client and on which I have root to inspect/block traffic.  My latest blog post shows the dozens of dozens of connections that a Mac running Big Sur will make just sitting idle at the desktop on a fresh install.Apple&#39;s products are only private if you want privacy from their commercial competitors. If you want privacy from Apple or the US federal government to which they provide tons of user data (without warrants(!) or due process), you&#39;re in for a constant uphill battle.Using everyday devices should not be creating hardware-serial-linked permanent records that the state can download at any time; to me that&#39;s stuff of a true dystopia.Apple has not yet integrated this viewpoint, and seem to regard privacy as only important against companies that aren&#39;t Apple.  Device backups (full message history and attachments), as well as Photos stored in iCloud, are not end to end encrypted permitting Apple (and by extension the state) to read and access all of it without your involvement.It&#39;s a bummer they&#39;re extending this attitude to browser-related traffic too. There seems to be a new trend inside of Apple that they&#39;re still figuring out here (see also: the addition of ContentFilterExclusionList in 11.0, and then its quick removal in 11.2).Did you know that if you entirely block access to all Apple hosts, you can&#39;t even add a Gmail account to an iPhone?"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"These stories usually spur more enthusiasm for buying cryptocurrency, but ironically those buyers aren’t interested in spending cryptocurrency using their MasterCard.They’re hoping other people will buy cryptocurrency from these announcements, driving the price up. Or, more likely, they’re just hoping other people will buy cryptocurrency and not use it in these spending systems.Spending cryptocurrency would result in selling that cryptocurrency, which would drive the price down. That’s not what cryptocurrency investors actually want.Should also note that MasterCard crypto transactions almost certainly won’t be settled on the blockchain. Not with $8 Bitcoin transaction fees.  They’ll just be denominated in cryptocurrency and people can deposit/withdraw in certain cryptocurrencies. MasterCard only needs to buy and sell on the blockchain as needed to provide an FX window. The actual transactions would be stored in traditional database systems (aside from customer deposits/withdrawals, just like Coinbase)Why? Because MasterCard would get to act as an exchange and collect exchange fees. Exchange fees are a great way to charge consumers for spending their own money in 2021, when normal credit cards actually pay people 1-2% to use them. Cryptocurrency’s inefficiency is their financial upside."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The game Paypal currently plays with Crypto is the closest thing to printing money I have ever seen:Their users can &#34;buy and sell Bitcoin&#34; and pay &#34;no fees&#34;. How does Paypal make money? &#34;From the spread&#34;. The difference between bid and ask. And who sets the spread? Drumroll ... Paypal!Since you cannot transfer your bitcoins out, when you sell your bitcoins, Paypal pays you whatever they like.So far, Paypal only offers this in the United States. And do the Americans take this offer? Yes! They buy over a billion dollars worth of Bitcoin per month on Paypal. If this continues, it means that every American from toddler to senior buys $50 worth of Bitcoin per year.Other companies in the finance industry will want the same free lunch. Run on crypto in 3..2..1..This will continue until the first companies will start to offer you to transfer your crypto out. Then slowly the market will normalize. Now everyone has crypto. In their paypal/mastercard/bank/whatever account and/or in their own wallet.Looks like chances for broader crypto adoption are pretty good."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Correction: The Fed&#39;s policies have taken $50T of wealth from the Bottom 90%.When you bail out irresponsibly over-leveraged and nearly bankrupted banks and corporations, and pay for those bailouts with tax-payer money, you steal from the poor and give to the rich.Most importantly, when the Fed decides to print money ad nauseam, they create massive asset inflation, which steals from the poor and gives to the rich. This is because those dollars that are printed go directly into bonds, equities, and assets that only a small amount of the population owns a significant amount of. When money is &#34;printed&#34; the Fed actually injects money into financial markets through buying assets. This asset inflation caused by money printing gives more money to the rich to buy more assets, thus driving up the prices of financial products, real estate, and all other valued assets in society. Thus, cost of living skyrockets, but only the rich are actually increasing their net worth (which is increasing exponentially). All of this happens while minimum wage, and most wages, are stagnant.Wealth inequality and social unrest in America is DIRECTLY related to corrupt and/or incompetent (you choose) Fed policies. It amazes me why most people do not grasp this. I think it is lack of education."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&#34;But poor people have iphones now&#34; when people can&#39;t afford food, healthcare, or any leisure time is the 2021 equivalent of &#34;Let them eat cake&#34;.The balance of wealth is insulting when we have so many basic needs not being met for those at the bottom&#34;Stealing&#34; is a word that gets knee jerk reactions. But the more polite way to phrase it is that the rich benefit from societal structure 1000x more than the poor and are able to acquire wealth at an accelerated pace because of these structures. Asking the wealthy to pay a greater share to improve society is perfectly reasonable. The fallacy in complaining against taxes for the rich that are already higher than their proportional of wealth is ignoring the fact that so much of taxes goes towards systems that just increase the rate of wealth accumulation. The wealthy reap the benefits of power in compounding ways."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The framing in the article is ahistorical. The post-WW2 period was a period of exceptionally _low_ inequality. If you look back to just the 1800s there were swings in inequality comparable to the present day. We&#39;re now moving back to the historical baseline.There are some contributing factors to the shift in inequality, a major one being that labor is now oversupplied compared to the post-war period, and the competition is driving wages lower. The U.S. has much higher immigration rates now, which contributes to the oversupply of labor. The late 1800s and early 1900s had similarly high immigration and high inequality. [1]Whether the historical baseline for inequality is the best amount of inequality is a different question though. It&#39;s clear that as redistribution flattens the income curve there is dead-weight loss as highly productive people stop wasting their time doing taxable work. It&#39;s also clear that investing in children who would otherwise be malnourished or lack education or healthcare is a net positive for society. It&#39;s not clear to me that the current level of inequality is the wrong one - we&#39;re admitting a lot of immigrants who are vastly improving their life prospects as a result, the economy is growing, and technology is amazing. Spending more money on health care would have limited benefits [2]. I don&#39;t really have a strong opinion on whether inequality should be higher or lower (it&#39;s hard to find a good-faith analysis in these terms), but the Time article uses an arbitrary timeframe and doesn&#39;t shed any light on the question.[1] See Ages of Discord for a much more detailed dive into this. http://peterturchin.com/ages-of-discord/[2] Robin Hanson gives an argument with lots of evidence here: https://www.cato-unbound.org/2007/09/10/robin-hanson/cut-med..."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I still cannot get over this product.  They whole selling point of a dyson fan is the &#39;air multiplier&#39; tech, which creates a low pressure zone that propels air through the ring.  According to dyson, this tech can move 15x more air than the fan in the base of the unit.  Why in the world would you build an air filter around a system that does not directly interact with 93% of the air it moves?https://www.jameco.com/Jameco/workshop/Howitworks/dysonairmu..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;ve spent many hours navigating the air purifier market and it is one of the most opaque and customer-unfriendly ones I have ever seen. Beyond the advice given in the article, it&#39;s also important to check what the filter exactly is. Some filters are washable, but it often means that they are not as thorough as HEPA filters, which is a big deal if your goal is to avoid the dreaded PM2.5 that are as far as I can tell the main threat to health and the pursuit of happiness.A more general problem is that there is a conceptual contradiction between low noise and high filtering. It will be difficult for a silent filter to be quick at filtering your room.The good news is that even a relatively crappy, low CADR setup can still filter a bedroom over time so long as it remains closed. You will however be paying for replacements more often and it might not be worth it if you have to ventilate daily and the filter takes many hours to give you a clean environment.I like the work that Smart Air China is doing. I am not affiliated with them, but they have essentially done and made available the same sort of research as the one highlighted in the article and have long promoted the no bullshit use of a simple box fan with filter combo for lower income and highly polluted regions."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I bought an expensive Dyson air purifier for a couple of reasons. It has a remote so I can turn it on from bed. It looks attractive. The sound profile is much different than a box fan for sleeping at night. It can analyze the temperature, humidity, and air quality in real time and turn on if it notices air quality is getting bad. It also oscillates.That said yes it was expensive, but it replaced needing a fan for cooling and an air purifier, and if I needed a heater it could have done triple duty."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Personally I&#39;ve been really happy with my split 60% keyboard from UltimateHackingKeyboard [0]. It also has open source electronics files and firmwareI backed them on CrowdSupply some years ago and although it took a while to be delivered have used it extensively since and even purchased a second one for at home &amp; the office. A huge positive while waiting for it was the regular, informative status emails from the founder.Now they are on to v2 [1] with backlighting and better keycaps.The &#34;Agent&#34; firmware is also regularly updated and makes customising the keyboard a breeze. I won&#39;t go extensively into the functionality here but it&#39;s worth checking out.I am in no-way affiliated with UHK but if anybody is looking for a split, open source, customisable keyboard I would highly recommend.[0] https://uhk.io/[1] https://ultimatehackingkeyboard.com/blog/2020/11/05/introduc..."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Over twenty years I&#39;ve spent too much money trying to get a keyboard that really worked for me... and I finally gave up and I now use the cheapest disposable crap from hole-in-the-wall electrical / electronics shop that I can walk to.Nearly all the DIY keyboards I&#39;ve seen are ruthlessly minimalistic and I really would prefer a larger keyboard with more keys, so I don&#39;t have to remember lots of meta-key combination short-cuts.  I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve memorised all the keyboard short cuts in a given piece of software in a decade... I just don&#39;t really use one particular thing enough to make it worthwhile.That keyboard with the active LED keycaps came out in what... 2006?  I expected a regular keyboard with small set of active keycaps for macro keys would have existed by now. Come to think of it, I never used an Apple laptop with that active TouchBar thing either but that doesn&#39;t seem to have achieved enduring popularity.  but I guess there&#39;s no real market for that either."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Nice. Using it for pavers makes sense, too. It will have some elasticity, which is fine for pavers but bad for structures.There are a few variants on this idea already. One is just to compress trash plastics into blocks, with no sand.[1] Another is a process more like brick making, where the material is melted.[2] That process is 20% recycled plastic, 80% sand etc.There are problems. UV deterioration. Cracking at low temperatures (probably not a problem in Kenya). Flammability. Poor adhesion to mortar. In the end, it&#39;s still polyethylene.[1] https://www.byfusion.com/[2] https://www.irjet.net/archives/V6/i4/IRJET-V6I4238.pdf"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"A lot of people here are asking the same question and I can&#39;t find it addressed anywhere: how does this product not heavily pollute the environment? Since the bricks contain plastic they are prone to flaking and the formation of microplastic particles, which can last for thousands of years and get into the digestive systems of animals and humans. Also, the plastic might crack from constant UV radiation under the Kenyan sun. Could somebody explain what the rationale might be for putting 1000 plastic bricks/day into the environment or if there&#39;s something I&#39;m missing?"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Regarding SQLite&#39;s performance, some things I&#39;ve found very useful:Use WAL mode (writers don&#39;t block readers):  PRAGMA journal_mode = &#39;WAL&#39;

Use memory as temporary storage:  PRAGMA temp_store = 2

Faster synchronization that still keeps the data safe:  PRAGMA synchronous = 1

Increase cache size (in this case to 64MB), the default is 2MB  PRAGMA cache_size = -64000

Lastly, use a modern version of SQLite. Many default installations come with versions from a few years ago. In Python for example, you can use pysqlite3[0] to get the latest SQLite without worrying about compiling it (and it also comes with excellent compilation defaults).[0] https://github.com/coleifer/pysqlite3"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; “But nobody writes production applications with SQLite, right?&#34;We&#39;ve been doing it for 5 years now. Basic tricks we employ are:Use PRAGMA user_version for purposes of managing automatic migrations, a. la. Entity Framework. This means you can actually do one better than Microsoft&#39;s approach, because you don&#39;t need a special unicorn table to store migration info. A simple integer compared with your latest integer and executing SQL in the range is all it takes.Use PRAGMA synchronous=NORMAL alongside PRAGMA journal_mode=WAL for maximum throughput while supporting most reasonable IT recovery concerns. If you are running your SQLite application on a VM somewhere and have RTO which is satisfied by periodic hot snapshots (which WAL is quite friendly to), this is a more than ideal way to manage recovery of all business data while also giving good throughput to writers. If you are more paranoid than we are, then you can do FULL synchronous for a moderate performance penalty. This would be more for situations where your RTO requires the exact state of the system be recoverable the moment it lost power. We can afford to lose the last few minutes of work without anyone getting yelled at. Some modern virtualization technologies do help a lot in this regard. Running bare metal you need to be a little more careful.For development &amp; troubleshooting, being able to copy a .db file (even while its in use) is tremendously powerful. I can easily patch up a QA database I mangled with a bad migrator in 5 minutes by stopping the service, pulling the .db local, editing, and pushing it back up. We can also ask our customers to zip up their entire db folder so we can troubleshoot the entire system state.Being able to use SQLite as our exclusive data store also meant that our software delivery process could be trivialized. We use zero external hosts, even localhost, for our application to be installed or started. We don&#39;t even require a runtime exist on the base operating system. Unzip our latest release build to a blank Win2019 server, sc.exe the binary path, net start the service, and it just works. Anyone can deploy our software because it&#39;s literally that simple. We didn&#39;t even bother to write a script because its a bigger pain in the ass to set powershell execution mode.So, its not just about the core data storage, but also about the higher-order implications of choosing to use a database solution that can be wholly embedded within your application. Because of decisions like these, we don&#39;t have to screw around with things like Docker or Kubernetes."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&#34;Solutions such as Kubernetes tout the benefits of zero-downtime deployments but ignore that their inherent complexity causes availability issues.&#34;This is completely accurate. I&#39;ve seen several teams do kubernetes, only to both spend 50% of their dev time on ops, AND cause outages due to kubernetes complexity. They do this all while boasting about zero downtime deployments. It&#39;s comical really."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I don&#39;t have any specific knowledge of this event but I did work for a smart cities company for a while and can explain some of what hypothetically leads to messes like this.Most municipal infrastructure automation is run by SCADA systems. SCADA systems are designed to be closed ecosystems by default, which means they don&#39;t have access to the internet. Cables are run and point to point connections are made to transport these signals. If you&#39;ve seen a big shiny aluminum box on the side of the road, that&#39;s a SCADA system.Consumer demand has changed a lot since SCADA was first thought up. These days people want to be able to log into a portal and see their billed water usage by the day. Cities want to be able to turn off a meter remotely at the click of a button rather than rolling a truck. They want pressure loss, contaminate, and fault detection. They&#39;d like to balance pressure in the water system dynamically. They want to perform detailed reports on total water loss, which means instrumenting pumps, retrieving telemetry data, auditing that data against every home usage, identifying faults, and producing a report out of it. All of these things don&#39;t work very well with closed ecosystems as they generally require a certain amount of external information. In response, cities have either crafted their own devices because they don&#39;t have the money to hire an integrator to design and produce them a device that will survive extreme weather conditions, be fault tolerant, make minimal use of power, and employ standard security measures or they hire an integrator. Even certain integrators can do shotty work.The takeaway from this isn&#39;t that SCADA is bad or the infrastructure version of &#34;the sky is falling!&#34;. It&#39;s that we desperately need to be thinking about how different generations of systems can be modularized and be built upon to minimize cost while maximizing security, capability growth, and reliability.For the folks talking about &#34;who tests what&#34;, I don&#39;t know what I can talk about in regards to specific programs but I feel confident that I can say that the FBI tracks this vigorously and works with companies that work in public infrastructure."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"My wife is a sewer commissioner for a tiny sewer district up in the mountains. It is a state of the art facility from a water treatment perspective since the treated water exits into a mountain stream. However, they recently needed to update their control systems because they all currently run on Windows98 and can no longer get spare parts from their vendors etc..At her request I sat in on a meeting with their vendor to ask some stupid questions (but less stupid than what the commissioners would have asked) about their proposal for updating the control systems.Some crazy things discovered:* it&#39;s all windows, all the time. I don&#39;t know why but I find this disturbing, but apparently all the drivers for these systems only work on windows. I guess Linux is only just starting to penetrate this market.* yes, remote access is a thing (even in the old system), especially in this case where the plant it under 20 feet of snow half the year. They claim the system can only monitor things, not control things, but I wonder how locked down that really is. Security is via a VPN.* the vendor at play here seems to be a tiny shop of a few people that basically serve a few dozen sewer treatment plants in the area. They deal with replacing the hardware and programming these interfaces in.. kind of a crazy local cottage industry I just wasn&#39;t really aware of.Having a background in web services / unix left me pretty unprepared to really do much more than ask some stupid questions around security / obsolescence, but the vendor had reasonable answers to my concerns. Just a very different world than what we think about every day."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is negligence on behalf of the water authority.10+ years ago I used to do demonstrations of this specific attack for govt and other critical infrastructure owners. 
In our demo, we had a two small vats of coloured &#34;chemicals,&#34; with pumps controlled by a bank of PLCs, an HMI and a network of a bunch of vulnerable VMs. We would walk people through how to exploit trivial web vulnerabilities that would get them to the HMI and cause the pumps to reverse and cause a chemical spill from the vats. The look on their faces when they caused a vat to overflow themselves with very little skill, was their &#34;scared-straight&#34; moment.It was 90&#39;s, even 80&#39;s level hacking. There is no way the managers didn&#39;t know this was possible and likely. They&#39;re only acting surprised. What this really looks like to me is a test run for something more coordinated and worse."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Great write up.  Think I&#39;ll get the kids, sorry technicians to walk through this.  Actually, I think I&#39;ll learn just as much but I have to keep a little bit aloof as MD!Networks are tricky to run and networking is proper hard to do.  TCP/UDP int al are pretty bloody good at shuffling data from A to B.  I find it quite amusing when 20 years is considered old for a bug.The Millenium bridge in London is a classic example of forgetting the basics - in this case resonance and being too clever for your own good.  It&#39;s a rather cool design for a bridge - a sort of a suspension bridge but flatter and some funky longitudinal stuff.  I&#39;m a Civ Eng grad.  It looked too flat to me from day one.When people walk across a bridge and it starts to sway, they start to lock step and then resonance, where each step reinforces the last kicks in and more and more energy causes sway, shear and what have you forces.  It gets worse and worse and then failure.  Tacoma Narrows is another classic example of resonance but due to wind - that informed designs that don&#39;t fly!Civ Eng is way, way older than IT and we are still learning.  24 years is nothing for a bug.  However, IT is capable of looking inward and monitoring itself (unit tests, ping etc) in a way that Civ Eng can&#39;t (OK we have strain gauges and a few other tools).The real difference between physical stuff and IT is that the Milli bridge rather obviously came close to failure visually and in a way that our other senses can perceive - it shook.  The fix was to put hydraulic dampers along its length.In IT, we often try to fix things by using magic or papering over flaws with &#34;just so&#34; stories.  Sometimes we get the tools out and do the job properly and these boys and girls did just that: the job properly."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I see a lot of people saying things like &#34;this is why package signing is important&#34; and &#34;we need to know who the developers are&#34; and &#34;we need to audit everything.&#34; Some of that is true to some degree, but let me ask you this: why do we consider it acceptable that code you install through a package manager implicitly gets to do anything to your system that you can do? That seems silly! Surely we can do better than that?This article from Agoric is extremely relevant here, from a previous such incident (re: the event-stream package on npm): https://medium.com/agoric/pola-would-have-prevented-the-even...Put simply: in many cases, the dependencies you install don&#39;t need nearly as much authority as we give them right now. Maybe some of these packages need network access (I see a few named &#34;logger&#34; which might be shipping logs remotely) but do they need unrestricted filesystem access? Probably not! (They don&#39;t necessarily even need unrestricted network access either; what they&#39;re communicating with is likely pretty well-known.)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This doesn&#39;t surprise me. Horrify.. yes.I&#39;ve noticed more dev teams succumbing to the temptation of easiness that many modern package managers provide (NPM, Cargo, Ivy, etc.) - especially as someone who has to work with offline systems on a regular basis.Because of that ease there are fewer tools and tutorials out there to support offline package management.  There are more for using caches, though these are often along the lines of either &#39;the package manager will do this for you and it just works (but in case it doesn&#39;t, delete node_modules or cargo clean and re-try)&#39;, or stand up a dependency server on your own machine with these proxy settings (which has it&#39;s own security issues and is frequently disallowed by IT cybersecurity policies).As an example, many blog articles I found a while back suggest using yumdownloader from the yum-utils package. This is unfortunately not reliable, as there are some packages that get skipped.I have found I need to script reading a list of dependencies from a file; then for each dependency: create a directory for it, use repotrack to download its RPM and it&#39;s transitive dependency RPMs in the dependency&#39;s directory; then the script aggregates all the RPMs into one directory, removes the OS installed RPMs, uses createrepo to turn that directory into a RPM repository, and then makes an USF ISO image out of the directory for transfer onto offline system and installation."</p>

If you want to upload artifacts to the main repository (Maven Central) you first need to show ownership of a particular domain. For example, via a DNS TXT record (example [1]).

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Nic Carter&#39;s rebuttal to a Bloomberg comparison between Bitcoin/Visa, including assessments of total and per/transaction energy usage:&#34;First of all, Bitcoin and Visa are fundamentally different systems. Bitcoin is a complete, self-contained monetary settlement system; Visa transactions are non-final credit transactions that rely on external underlying settlement rails. Visa relies on ACH, Fedwire, SWIFT, the global correspondent banking system, the Federal Reserve and, of course, the military and diplomatic strength of the U.S. government to ensure all of the above are working smoothly.Any energy comparison must take the above into account – including the externalities from the extraction of oil, which implicitly backs the dollar. As those who make this comparison inevitably fail to mention, the dollar’s ubiquity is partly due to a covert arrangement whereby the U.S. provides military support to countries like Saudi Arabia that agree to sell oil exclusively for dollars. It’s worth noting that the grossly oversized U.S. military, whose presence worldwide is necessary to backstop the international dollar system, is the largest single consumer of oil worldwide.&#34;https://www.coindesk.com/what-bloomberg-gets-wrong-about-bit..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"At that rate and assuming 4tx per second a single Bitcoin transaction consumes 165kWh. A Tesla battery is bit over 50kWh. So let&#39;s round that to 3 full charges of Tesla battery.That&#39;s 350km/220 miles of range per charge. In total 1050km or 660 miles of driving.So basically if you want to transfer money and the recipient is closer than 660 miles from you it&#39;s more efficient to just get a bunch of bills, drive there with a Tesla rather than send a Bitcoin transaction. Or alternatively 330 miles roundtrip. For each single transaction.It is hilariously inefficient system. It is literally better to drive a full car and give things physically than use Bitcoin.A small addenum: Visa apparently uses 146kWh for 100000 transactions. Coming at 1.46wH per transaction. That can drive a Tesla for 9 meters (0.4 seconds of driving at 80km/h) or alternatively keep a nice led lamp lit for an hour. And that includes everything the company does, not just the actual transaction but the upkeep of their offices etc divided by the amount of transactions they perform per year.EDIT:Apparently on 2020 it was 741kWh per transaction in practice and/or I made a tiny error in my calculation. Either way it&#39;s even better!https://www.statista.com/statistics/881541/bitcoin-energy-co...That simply increases the ranges so that it becomes a 3600 mile trip. Or 1800 mile roundtrip."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Since this is posted here I&#39;ll ask a question that has been bugging me for the last year: Who does the captions on these YouTube videos? Is it automated? I ask because every CS193p video starts with the same opening scene/music and the caption describing the music is different on every single one. Is this an auto-caption algorithm just getting it wrong? Or is there a person having fun behind the scenes waiting for someone like me to notice and spend an irrational amount of time wondering what happened? I feel like it has to be a person, right? YouTube&#39;s captioning wouldn&#39;t give 12 different results.Edit- For anyone curious, here&#39;s how the music is described in the captions at the beginning of each lecture:1. regal music2. mellow ambient music3. light music4. gentle music5. air whooshing6. gentle music (turns out there is one repeat)7. peaceful music8.

It&#39;s also clear that he enjoys teaching the course, which makes a big difference.I watched an earlier iteration of the course, and it&#39;s the reason I know iOS development today. I don&#39;t often write reviews (and certainly not on HN), but I absolutely have to recommended this course for anyone interested in learning mobile development."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Similar thing happened to me. I built an online Japanese - English dictionary and used AdSense to monetize it. One day I got an email saying that my domain has been permabanned because my website appears to be promoting rape and pedophilia. As an example of one of the many offending pages on my domain they sent me urls to the definition and translation of words &#34;pedophilia&#34; and &#34;rape&#34; in Japanese.Of course none of my competitors using the exact same data set had any such problems.I tried for YEARS to appeal it. There are simply no humans working at Google and nobody reads your emails.Edit: Actually, I did get a response a couple times but it was obviously automated. They just said to remove the ads from the pages where such words are displayed. So I added a simple rule and a column in the database to hide ads for those keywords. That just triggered the bot to move down the list of their &#34;obscene&#34; language. Next it was the names of various sexual positions, acts and fetishes (Japanese does have a very rich vocabulary in that topic), then manga slang, even silly sounding onomatopoeias that when explained in plain English are &#34;vulgar&#34;, etc.. It seems once your website is flagged there is simply no way get clean."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I think what we&#39;re learning from many debacles on YouTube, Amazon, and Google is this:Algorithms are not even close to substituting for human customer service, human moderation, and human judgment.Maybe this means web-scale sites like Amazon&#39;s marketplace aren&#39;t viable. I&#39;m fine with that implication. Stores like Target and Walmart seem to have the same prices with human-curated inventories, and I don&#39;t really miss the millions of extra products Amazon has."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Nowadays when I want to buy anything on Amazon it takes so much effort to go through which listing is the Sponsored/ad-based listing vs organic in search. Once that hurdle is crossed, it comes to going through the reviews to see which reviews can be trusted and which can not be. And even after that hurdle, once I place order, I am not sure the item I received is counterfeit or genuine. Too much work and definitely not customer-focused experience!I guess going to Target is much easier to get the necessary shopping done."</p>

Refactored code is almost always radically better, even when it&#39;s in the same language, for reasons that might be insulting to explain on HN.Point is, this is not an apples-to-apples comparison.(I&#39;m not arguing Rust isn&#39;t better.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Another reason not to use EST/EDT is that they are overspecifying the time zone in most cases. If you ask for output in EDT, but the date is in December (which is not part of daylight savings time) then should the date output be UTC-4 or UTC-5?  Technically you asked for EDT.Using EST as a shortcut isn’t a good idea, either - most software will “know what you mean” and use EST or EDT appropriately... except, both The USA and Canada have been toying with the idea of dropping daylight savings time, so it’s very possible at some point in the future that 6:00pm on July 1st will be EDT in America/New York, but EST in America/Montreal (or vice versa). This is already true for CST - Saskatchewan doesn’t use DST.  And there have been times where one country or another changes the start date or end date of DST too, so there’s no reason to assume those will always be the same between Canada and the US."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The only situation where our datetime instances deal with timezones is on a one way trip to a user&#39;s display, document or email. If you are playing around with parsing timezone strings, you are probably making a huge mistake unless you are parsing someone else&#39;s trash data.I feel the standard interchange format for datetimes really should be 64 bit Unix timestamps. These are trivial to store in any database as a native type, can be compared using the fastest arithmetic instructions possible, and are a locale agnostic representation suitable for direct business logic comparisons.Trying to carry timezone information around is a mistake. This is state that should be terminated and normalized at both ends, not passed through the system.The only thing I would store pertaining to timezone is for user profile or server environment configuration. These would be settings in the application that are used to produce locale-specific UI and reports.There are probably some other use cases I am not thinking of, but that is the extent of how we do it and we have a really complex app that has to serve customers who operate in multiple timezones at once."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&#39;There is no good reason to use short timezone codes like EST, CST, PST — doing so will only bring you pain. Either use the tzdb name like America/New_York, or use an offset from UTC, depending on what you want.&#39;All you need to read/remember is this, this applies everywhere not just with date."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I used to work as a scholar of Britain (specifically executions in Early Modern England, but you pick up a lot along the way) and I&#39;ve tried to explain to a lot of people the amount of influence and control that the monarch actually holds.  I&#39;m not sure that this is such a bad thing.  The Queen can&#39;t create legislation, she can restrain it.  She is purely a moderating influence in this sense.  She could, in theory, name new people to the House of Lords, but the Lords is no longer a hereditary body and there is a mechanism for the House of Commons to override the Lords.Parliament does have power over the monarch in some senses, of course, in that there is precedent for Parliament changing the order of succession or introducing a regency.  This happened without the monarch&#39;s assent, though admittedly over a hundred years ago.  But the British constitution is one that replies on precedence, not a formal document.I&#39;ve characterized the Queen&#39;s powers as &#34;reserve powers&#34; inasmuch as, if everything goes wrong and Parliament dies from a meteor strike, the government still legally operate provided there is a monarch (even if you have to reach deep into the line of succession to find that person).  By law she has to call elections within a certain amount of time.  Obviously there&#39;s nothing to force her to follow the laws, but that&#39;s true of any country.  She (or her heirs) are the leaders of last resort."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The most obvious difference between the American and British legislative systems is the presence of a foundational document like the Constitution.The British system is strictly about convention and precedent, whereas Americans have a little more explicit guidance from the Constitution.I think what we&#39;ve learned as Americans in the last few years is that it isn&#39;t enough to have a foundational document.  Convention and precedent indeed play a large role in the function of how the well government works.  Congress is now terminally defective, largely because of the loss of the norms and violations of precedent, starting roughly in the mid 90&#39;s.Perhaps the idea that convention and precedent is the only thing holding the British system together makes it stronger."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Isn&#39;t Britain a Constitutional *Monarchy*?Did they forget that? There&#39;s still the House of Lords and the House of Commons for a reason. The monarchy and the landowners are still a thing and are still a ruling class."</p>

Expect bugs, breaking changes, etc.On the other hand, it is also a great time for anyone who wants to jump in and help shape things, so feedback will be very welcome!"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Exciting to see that heavy numerical computation might be available to a language running on BEAM. It has always seemed to me like an area that people would point to where Elixir couldn&#39;t stand up to Python.I&#39;ve always dreamt that someday you might be able to reach for Elixir and get everything you needed for an entire stack of a company and it seems to be getting closer and closer. The building blocks for a web app have been around with Phoenix and Ecto for quite some time. LiveView was introduced to make more user friendly frontends. GenStage, Flow, and Broadway introduced ways to run data processing pipelines. And now we&#39;re seeing the initial steps to potentially have ML capabilities."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;m really excited about this project. Seeing Elixir inch this much closer to being a viable option for machine learning and related fields is great.In case someone here wants to read rather than listen to all the details, I wrote down some notes over at: https://elixirforum.com/t/anyone-who-wants-to-speculate-abou..."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The real problem here is that there is no consequence for incorrect takedowns.  If content is taken down and then it turns out to be fair use, no one suffers a penalty.The DMCA and similar laws provide protection to the platform if they act quickly on takedown notices, but the law needs to be updated to provide penalties for the reporter for inappropriate takedowns.This would allow Google/Facebook/et al to change their tools from automatic takedown to reporting the violation to the copyright holder, and then it is up to the copyright holder to file a claim.  If perhaps the copyright holder makes too many erroneous claims, they lose their copyright altogether.Let the platforms be neutral, put the liability on the copyright violators and copyright holders equally, so both have a reason to act fairly."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Good that OSM is accurate in cities as well, because in hiking, skiing, or even some ferry routes, OSM simply wins because that&#39;s often the only mapping provider to even have _any_ data. Some of my first hand experiences:- French GR-20 routes. Google maps are laughably empty, while OSM has you covered with almost the same information as the hiking maps you can buy on the trail.- Anapurna - similar to GR-20 situation. This route gets changed often due to landslides, but there is always some person doing a great job updating information not too late after.- Volcanoes - OSM maps often contain camping grounds, water sources, etc. This is something I actively contribute too. The level of detail is amazing. Some guides in fact lose potential clients because of this.OSM is a wonderful feat by all its contributors, and isn&#39;t appreciated as much as it deserves."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;ve been looking to replace Google Maps with OSM on my smartphone.  OSM itself is great, but I&#39;ve been having a harder time finding a good app to use it with.  Is anyone familiar with a good option?  I mostly use a maps app for location searches and real-time GPS navigation, but offline maps and location sharing are nice-to-have features.I&#39;ve been using OsmAnd and it&#39;s okay.  The interface is pretty good.  It supports offline maps, but not location sharing.  Map tiles are kind of slow to load compared to Google Maps, which is odd since the tiles have to be downloaded to local storage.  The location search often includes redundant results and whatever database they use to store place data is sparse on details like pictures, hours, or reviews.  I&#39;ll keep using it to stay de-platformed from Google as much as possible, but I&#39;d be willing to pay a bit for something more responsive and polished."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"As Google has lost it&#39;s sheen of benevolence over the last decade public knowledge projects like this become ever more appealing. Wikipedia proves they can be wildly successful all without capital investment and the perverse incentives that follow."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Not proving solutions to textbooks seems to be a common theme in mathematics and theoretical computer science. It makes it difficult for those outside of the traditional classroom to learn the material. Instead textbook writers seem to have this adversarial approach against readers, thinking they’ll “cheat themselves” if they look up solutions or attempt to verify their work. Experts make mistakes, beginners would presumably make even more mistakes. Without a feedback mechanism beginners can’t truly know whether their logic is impeccable or if they have a subtle error that they themselves cannot detect. They could easily fool themselves that they have correct understanding.Due to that I will not recommend this current book to any colleagues.If you want an example of a fellow hacker news member that did things right, check out 
http://joshua.smcvt.edu/linearalgebra/He provides solutions and lecture videos... this is truly a democratization approach to learning and a model that other academics should follow."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"From https://jeffe.cs.illinois.edu/teaching/algorithms/hwex.html#...&gt;Please do not ask me for solutions. With very rare exceptions, I will say no, even if you are an instructor. I recognize that my stance limits the utility of these materials, especially for self-learners, but I&#39;m trying to optimize the learning experience of my own students at Illinois. The point of homework is not to solve that particular homework problem, but to practice solving a type of problem and get honest feedback on your progress. I&#39;ve found that when solutions are available, my own students are much more likely to rely on them, rather than trying to figure out the problems themselves, which means they get both less practice and less honest feedback, which means they do worse on exams and in the course overall.Interesting. I was asked multiple times for solutions to my self-pub ebooks that I relented. I didn&#39;t add them initially as I wanted readers to solve by themselves or ask for help if needed (and I did get a few mails, saw one of them asked on stackoverflow as well).See also https://github.com/tayllan/awesome-algorithms for more learning resources, practice problems, visualizations, etc."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Core dev Larry Hastings [0] puts it well. The cost-benefit case for this complicated language feature is limited.&#34;I dislike the syntax and semantics expressed in PEP 634. I see the match statement as a DSL contrived to look like Python, and to be used inside of Python, but with very different semantics. When you enter a PEP 634 match statement, the rules of the language change completely, and code that looks like existing Python code does something surprisingly very different. It also adds unprecedented new rules to Python, e.g. you can replace one expression with another in the exact same spot in your code, and if one has dots and the other doesn’t, the semantics of what the statement expresses changes completely. And it changes to yet a third set of semantics if you replace the expression with a single _.I think the bar for adding new syntax to Python at this point in its life should be set very high. The language is already conceptually pretty large, and every new feature means new concepts one must learn if one is to read an arbitrary blob of someone else’s Python code. The bigger the new syntax, the higher the bar should become, and so the bigger payoff the new syntax has to provide. To me, pattern matching doesn’t seem like it’s anywhere near big enough a win to be worth its enormous new conceptual load.&#34;This while we have elephants in the room such as packaging. Researching best practices to move away from setup.py right now takes you down a rabbit hole of (excellent) blog posts, and yet you still need a setup.py shim to use editable installs, because the new model simply doesn&#39;t yet support this fundamental feature.I can&#39;t afford to spend days immersing myself in packaging to the point of writing a PEP, but would help pay someone to do it well. I can see no way to fund packaging efforts directly on the PSF donations page (edit: see comment). It&#39;s great to see Pip improving but there is still not even a coherent guide that I can find for packaging using up-to-date best practices. This appears to be because the best practices are currently slightly broken.[0] https://discuss.python.org/t/gauging-sentiment-on-pattern-ma..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Honestly I&#39;m not sure what all the fuss is about.  I just skimmed over PEP 634 and PEP 636 (the accompanying tutorial) and I&#39;m actually kind of excited to use this.  I&#39;ve missed this feature after using langs like Rust, Haskell, and Scala.  People have pointed out some surprising edge cases such as this:    NOT_FOUND = 404
    match get_status():
        case NOT_FOUND:
            # this actually assigns to the global NOT_FOUND
            # and is effectively the default case
        case _:
            # this never gets triggered

Yeah, I agree that&#39;s a bit ugly.  But you can apparently do this:    class Status(Enum):
        NOT_FOUND = 404

    match get_status():
        case Status.NOT_FOUND:
            # works as expected
        ...

And really how is any of that more ugly than this?    def func_with_default(foo={}):
        if &#34;bar&#34; not in foo:
            # &#34;bar&#34; is set in the module-level dict that
            # was initialized when the func def was parsed,
            # not in a dict that is created per call
            foo[&#34;bar&#34;] = ...
        ...

And we&#39;ve been living with that one for years.  These are just the things that you have to learn when you start using Python, just like any other language.I, for one, am excited to start using this syntax."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&gt;the Times’ tech team quickly donned their hall-monitor goggles and Stasi notebooks to warn that the Bad People had migrated to Signal and Telegram. This week they asked: “Are Private Messaging Apps the Next Misinformation Hot Spot?” One reporter “confess[ed] that I am worried about Telegram. Other than private messaging, people love to use Telegram for group chats — up to 200,000 people can meet inside a Telegram chat room. That seems problematic.”I&#39;m already hearing this in local debates. It seems to seriously scare some folks that there are places where they cannot deplatform whoever they want for anything.(PS: Open groups and channels are not encrypted on Telegram servers and can be reported. It is just that Telegram doesn&#39;t have a history of letting other abuse it.)Edit: I&#39;ve been planning to subscribe for a while. I do now.Do it if $5 is pocket money for you. If not for this then for something else he have done.Good journalism is extremely important but much of what we see today is a mix of extreme bias, outright lies and outrage manufacturing."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Some thoughts on the bigger picture-1: Really?  Do you have to write &#34;r-word&#34; instead of &#34;retard&#34; when you&#39;re writing about someone saying something?  What if Marc literally said &#34;r-word&#34; and I&#39;m vastly underestimating how woke this reporter is?  Wait, I have a solution. Use the actual word that a person said when quoting them.  Just write the exact sentence where you think Marc said the word retard.  Nobody should prosecute you for quoting someone without endorsing their opinion.  Obfuscating your reporting to avoid a word is bad writing style.1.5: Otherwise, the above seems to limit us to 26 taboo slurs in the English language.  A-word, b-word, c-word, ... There are other rude words, but there can only be a single r-word so bad that I mustn&#39;t spell it.  To prevent confusion, I have to completely spell/say the rest of the r-words.  What I&#39;m getting at is whole thing of not saying a word is silly.  Everyone knows that the c-word means cunt (at least in the USA).  If this wasn&#39;t common knowledge then you couldn&#39;t say c-word and have everyone know what you meant.  (Who decided that cunt was a worse word than chink anyway?  That&#39;s marginalizing Chinese people and totally not-woke. /s)2.  There are people that exaggerate and sensationalize something to get more views.  Some people are even fine trying to ruin someone&#39;s reputation.  But we are getting wise to these sorts of things.  If it&#39;s an isolated event these things kind of go away.  Even if Marc is on record once saying &#34;retard&#34; he&#39;s probably not a bad guy. Just from growing up in the 90&#39;s I&#39;ve easily said it a thousand times.  If I start to hear several other instances accusing Marc of using a slur and saying it in a hurtful manner then I&#39;ll revisit the issue."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"He&#39;s right. When I started writing in the 90&#39;s, there was an idea of journalism as telling stories in the principled defence of minority interests and as a public check on institutional power, but it has mutated into the unhinged and corrupt prosecution of deviance from official narrative lines. Social media is just a way for neighbours to denounce one another in a new snitch culture that rivals any 20th century system. I&#39;m usually a couple of years ahead of the curve on trends, and I even dropped Slack last year because it&#39;s not a place for real discourse."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&gt; The complicated web was here. [...]&gt; I&#39;ve given in my resignation at my current place of employment and will be seeking an exclusively back-end role for my next adventureOh boy. I sympathise entirely with this post, but the story&#39;s exactly the same on the backend.Kubernetes. Docker. AWS and its gazillion impenetrable product names. The days of security updates, pentests, honeypots and captchas you have to go through in order to put up a webapp that won&#39;t be commandeered by (insert bad guy here) within hours. The endless cycle of breakage on your server because LetsEncrypt or whoever have upgraded their crypto libraries to fight against (insert bad guy here).The need for a lawyer to write you a privacy policy before you can let people log into your site. The endless bullshit of dealing with &#34;Log in with Facebook/Google/Apple&#34; because that&#39;s what people expect these days. And even then it&#39;s better than dealing with email verification because Gmail/Hotmail will kill your emails anyway.The complicated web is everywhere. Retreating to the backend is no escape. Sorry."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"It&#39;s disheartening to explain this over and over again, but these frameworks are a-ok because user&#39;s expectations for the web have grown astronomically. The complicated web is here because users insist on interaction, and if any web page has more than around 10 interactions on it, the resultant complexity is best handled by a framework. I recently got to do a jQuery job for a client-- it wasn&#39;t a pleasant blast from the past but a kludgey swamp to slog through.The build pipeline complaint also strikes me as hollow. Create React App outputs folder you can drag and drop onto a  server and serve, same for Angular and I would assume Vue. Yes, it is a lot of JS from a ton of NPM libraries, but that&#39;s the trade-off when you get an entire ecosystem of code for free. If your application is security critical then consider either writing your own libraries or hosting security vetted copies of the libraries.The real reason to leave this industry is that it&#39;s all the same work at the end of the day. Despite what application you build, whether it&#39;s a social network, a security application or collaborative tool like Figma or Trello, it all runs together as a mish-mash of views, data and DOM elements. Unless you&#39;re really invested in the product, it becomes hard to maintain enthusiasm. You can only roll a CSS library, or auth scheme or API library so many times before you&#39;re ready to start some new adventures in coding."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"There&#39;s a bit of hyperbole in the article, but it strikes a nerve.I originally came from Java and was so fed up with the hulking class lib and the arcane build systems sprinkled with Ant snippets and XML galore, so JS felt like a fresh breeze.AngularJS was a bit convoluted and the syntax was not nice. But OK, data binding was nice. Bit like dependency injection on the Java side made the code much harder to reason about but helped build certain classes of applications.Angular 4 was just WTF. Somewhat cleaner module system but now with a clunky OOP language instead of the elegant functional expressions that JS had and Java finally adopted. For which reason exactly?And I tried Vue which is a much lighter framework but like Angular, the build system is just retarded. Instead of many dozens of JARs with dozens of sub-dependencies, modern JS goes for the kill and literally imports several hundred of npm package with thousands of dependencies.And in the end, I end up having to use &#34;browserify&#34; to have JS running in a browser. It&#39;s a clowns world in IT, but modern JS really takes the cake. I&#39;m back in backend, solving real problems instead of wrangling my build chain."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Interesting business model----------Experts Host Sites Here for $1/monthDo you like paying extra so other people can ask amateur questions? That&#39;s how it is at other hosting companies where beginners and experts pay the same price. Beginners drive up the cost by asking a lot of novice support questions while the experts don&#39;t contact support. That is great for amateurs, and unfair to the experts like you.No Support Linux Hosting has a completely different business model. We ignore the support questions, and pass the savings on to you! If you are an expert who does not want to pay extra for help with amateur support issues, then you can host with us and save big money.Experts like you can sign up now for free. We charge $1/month per website, and there is no limit to the number of websites you can host in your account. This is the best deal in the web hosting industry, as long as you are the type of person who can find his or her own answers.-----------From https://web.archive.org/web/20201109042643/https://www.nosup...I guess they took savings from security too."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Looks like it was old school shared web hosting with things like WHMCS, Cpanel, Softaculous, Wordpress one-click installers, in-house written web admin, etc.  Where each user was running in the same instance of Linux.  Not, for example, a VM per user.  That kind of setup has a really wide attack surface.  Not surprising it was hacked.  That kind of setup with deliberately narrow support was bound to get hit.Edit: Apparently their &#34;sister company&#34; sells virtual private servers, and appears to still be alive. http://nosupportvpshosting.com/index.php"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"They were almost certainly impacted by the recent sudo bug, considering how they offered cPanel hosting: https://archive.is/PCZ99 I&#39;ve been trying to make contact with virtual hosting providers over the last few weeks to bring the weakness to their attention, but I&#39;ve been ignored. cPanel hasn&#39;t even issued an update. It&#39;s heartbreaking watching websites get destroyed by the bad guys."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I feel like Google is a case study in an engineering only company. Everything is reduced to a technical problem. Incentives are aligned to solve technical problems. No one wants to work on something unless it is technically interesting and new. There is no incentive at all for delivering an excellent user experience over the long term - which usually can&#39;t be done with tech only, and involves a lot of dredge work of continuous introspection and improvement.We see this again and again. The cynic in me sees Stadia as yet another internal promotion scheme, masquerading as a product.I doubt this will ever change. The internal momentum of the company culture will make it so. What does it mean for investors? Google has enough money they can just buy their way into markets indefinitely. It will probably keep them going, but I don&#39;t expect huge growth. I&#39;d probably be putting my money into other stocks if I had to choose. I honestly don&#39;t think people would miss Google much if it was gone."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"It&#39;s painfully clear at this point that we need a consumer &#34;bill of rights&#34; to protect us from these giant tech companies. At the very least, companies must be legally required to present you in writing with the so-called violation of terms they&#39;re accusing you of,  evidence of the violation, and a phone # or other immediate contact so that you can dispute the accusations. It&#39;s insane that these basic legal rights don&#39;t even exist.You could of course sue Google, but that&#39;s an extremely expensive and time-consuming option, rarely worth it for a mere consumer. Going to court certainly won&#39;t make your suspended account become unsuspended any quicker."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&gt; The co-founder of the company, Mark Perlin, is said to have argued against source code analysis by claiming that the program, consisting of 170,000 lines of MATLAB code, is so dense it would take eight and a half years to review at a rate of ten lines an hour.First, the defence doesn&#39;t necessarily have to evaluate all 170,000 lines. They just need to find one buggy line which could potentially overturn the result.Second, even if it did take a full 8 years, is that a good reason to deny the defendant due process?"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I have worked with MATLAB code with 20,000 lines of code. Only over the past years, OOP and unit-testing has become properly available and usable. My guess is that this 170,000 lines are written in the old procedural way (also for performance reasons) and are full of bugs, also thanks to the lack of supporting tools.Most likely, this grew out of a research prototype that just worked too well to be reimplemented in a proper production environment."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This is possibly tied to the recent assault on the ZXing Barcode scanner app[1].This is a legit open source app that&#39;s been recently flooded by 1-star reviews claiming that the app contains malware, probably in order to get users to switch to the other apps.
The funny thing is this app has not been updated since 2019 on the Play Store, so those reviews are clearly bogus.It takes a special kind of scum to slander an open source project in order to push malware.[1]: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.zxi..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Even legitimate app developers have no incentive to keep their apps sterile. Someone just has to approach you with your 10+ million users barcode scanner app and offer you +50,000$ in order to install some automated ad clicker for them.Don’t be naive, the majority will accept the money and gladly.I believe that particularly makeshift applications such as e.g. barcode scanners are susceptible to this kind of overtake. Apps that offer what should have been offered by the OS vendor in the first place. Why should the app developer refuse the money if what their app offers will be incorporated in a next OS update by anyways? Why defend your mini-adapter-app in an ocean of mini-adapter-apps, with yours becoming so large just because of a random seed and path dependency?This can have a big impact for end users. Imagine an authenticator app ending service to all their users in such a scheme and how you will be cut out from all your accounts by this. How many authenticator apps do you have to use in parallel to mitigate this risk of a single point of failure?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The only reason this was detected was very overt behavior - opening AD popups. So I guesstimate for each one of these we have 10 that go undetected. 
This means the whole ecosystem is broken, as there is no reason this will happen only for updates and not for new apps as well. Apple&#39;s ecosystem is somewhat better, but I can&#39;t imagine they go through every line of code in each package, so most of their review is probably done with some combination of automatic static and dynamic analysis, and these can be fooled. The problem with both platforms is that they don&#39;t provide run of the mill users the option of installing an effective firewall and security solutions."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; The decision making power within the Rust project is uniquely delegated and distributed; with the core team holding little more privilege than other more specialized teams. [...] And the potential of such a system has bore fruit: It is not a mistake that such a promising technology has emerged from such a progressive conception of collaboration.These are values and thoughts describing an approach that the KDE community (and its foundation; hello from another board!) holds equally dearly and has inscribed in its Manifesto (https://manifesto.kde.org/, cf. Common Ownership).While maybe not unique, I&#39;m excited to see another organization adopt this idea set (a support body not interfering with technical agenda, low barriers to participation, not entrenching maintainers, working succession mechanisms, etc.) as a core message. We&#39;ve seen it work very well to sustain a productive community for 25 years and I think this bodes well for Rust!"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;m really happy to see this happen. I&#39;m also really thrilled to see Lars Bergstrom on the board, and am excited about taking Rust farther both at Google and across the industry. Rust is evolving from being centered at Mozilla to being a true community and collaboration between many different groups, including big companies, so I think a well-supported foundation is key.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Bitcoin is a mystery to me. Somehow it&#39;s hailed as revolutionising the economy, by replacing currency with a worse kind of currency.It feels like this is where all the &#34;how to get rich quick&#34; book writers and other hustle bros went and created one giant financial pyramid, which works in quite simple way:
- buy bitcoin
- tell everyone around how revolutionary it is, so they buy it and what you holding increases in value, then tell them to do the same.Keep repeating the above two steps through different layers of abstraction, so it&#39;s not so obvious anymore.The other thing that comes into play and makes it grow even bigger is when people see others who made money on this bunch of bollocks, and think that the fact they are rich somehow makes them smart. Then they buy into all of the cryptocurrency platitudes wholesale without stopping for a moment to critically evaluate it.I think I&#39;m a bit sour, because this whole crypto-crap infested the idea space of decentralisation, which is imho very important step that we should try to take take as a society. Now it&#39;s just forever tainted with bitcoin and all the greed fuelled people there, while the decentralisation should be quite the opposite in nature.You know what would be revolutionary? Getting rid of currency altogether."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Oh noes, if this starts a trend, becomes widespread, and businesses start hoarding crypto tokens instead of investing in building stuff, it could cause a great depression pretty much the same way gold hoarding caused the economy to collapse in 1929.When people, businesses and banks start hording tokens instead of investing in building and maintaining the production capacity of consumables, the ratio of value of tokens meant to buy consumables vs the actual production of consumables gets out of wack.When the music stops, people realize that others are sitting on tons of seemingly valuable tokens but stuff to buy with them is getting scarce because capacity is not being maintained, they reverse their trade, prices of stuff go up, volatility ensues in an incredibly destructive cycle.Too much savings being tied to tokens instead of assets that create real value is an economy wide coordination failure, a terrible Nash equilibrium. It can be hard to solve because it&#39;s a prisoner&#39;s dilemma where the first people to invest in real production are disadvantaged so everyone hoards tokens instead.This is what central banks are designed to prevent. We don&#39;t want cryptocoins to cause another great depression like gold tied currencies did almost a hundred years ago."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This comment is unlikely to win me many friends here, but it is worth considering that while Bitcoin is, nominally at least, decentralized and free from government control, internet access is not.A simple glance at the trend of governments to partially or to fully shut down internet services to certain areas in times of unrest or mass protest means, in the case of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies requiring collective transaction verification via online communications, that a loss of internet constitutes an inability to conduct financial transactions for those thus affected.While I applaud the efforts of so many to free the world from government control of &#34;money&#34;, the full implementation of this effort should be preceded by freeing internet communications from the control of those same governments, otherwise what appears to be a new financial &#34;power&#34; is actually a new financial &#34;weakness&#34;.Think over this carefully."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Anecdata: Trello and Jira both have free plans that I used that caused me to recommend them for paid usage at multiple companies I’ve worked with. Those free plans resulted in $xx-$xxxx monthly subscriptions.Asana has a paid plan with a 5-user minimum limit. I never bothered to even try it since I wouldn’t have the extended time to play with it. As a result it never even got mentioned to companies I’ve worked with.So, it’s important to have a free plan (or at least very cheap paid plan as the article recommended) for “influencers” to get heavily involved with."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is really aggressively oversimplifying a complicated problem that exists across a huge number of different types of software. In some cases, sure, a free plan is going to cost more in effort than it pays in users who convert to paid. That said, the objection that free users are going to take up too much time is pretty easily solved... look at Google, which has zero customer support and an enormous number of free users. As long as you set expectations up front, you can offer minimal customer service to free users (which also means you can sell it as part of paid plans).But even beyond that, there are just so many generalizations here that may not apply to you. Deciding whether to have a free plan or not should depend on what the actual percent of your users that convert from free to paid is - you shouldn&#39;t just go with no free plan because someone says, &#34;Many users will never ever pay, regardless of how good your product is and how much of a problem it solves.&#34;There&#39;s some reasonable thoughts in here, but the absolutism of it shows that the author hasn&#39;t really considered the breadth of possible scenarios here - likely they&#39;ve gone through this analysis with a product or two and come to the right conclusion, but that doesn&#39;t mean that conclusion is anywhere close to 100% applicable."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"It is sad but true that users that pay less, or zero, are more demanding on customer support and make unreasonable demands via social. Had a guy this week using our free product that has 90% of the paid products features berating us on Twitter for not being 100% free and demanding we convert and rely on donations to support our 40 person team. Makes me regret having a free offering. In my 20 years doing software startups I’ve seen this over and over. Simply raising your prices, which we’ve raised to over 5x, dramatically reduces load on the  CS team per dollar earned."</p>

https://securityheaders.com/?q=https%3A%2F%2Fdashboard.clerk...For me it is also a red flag to include third party CDN JS (especially without SRI) on security critical applications (like the login for the dashboard and customer logins do with jsdelivr)."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"So, first, congrats on launching your product. :) Personally, I don&#39;t have a need for it, and if I did, I&#39;d be very reluctant to use a proprietary service, but I&#39;m sure there are companies out there who will be happy to use you. Good luck!------------That said, maybe the HN community can answer something I&#39;ve wondered about... Why isn&#39;t there an Open Source, standardized, self-hosted, version of this kind of service? Or, why hasn&#39;t one, or two, options emerged that everyone uses and I would have heard of by now?User management, authentication, and authorization, are all problems that have been solved in many apps, and there are plenty of best practices. So, just like you shouldn&#39;t roll your own hashing algorithm, I&#39;d think we&#39;d want to do the same with this. It would make sense for one of the open source companies or organizations like Canonical, RedHat, Apache or Mozilla to have at least tried to do this.The closest I can think of to an attempt is Persona...Anyway, just been wondering about this for a while, and thought I&#39;d take the opportunity to ask."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Really good stuff. The Next.js integration story is already really quite good[1] and the Clerk team has really good ideas on how to make it even better and more seamless.It&#39;s great to see a service focus on taking away all the pain related to user management, not just login.[1] https://frontend-docs.clerk.dev/react/quick-starts/next.js"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I was surprised and happy to see this also being open sourced. As a developer of OpenLieroX (http://www.openlierox.net/), we also took inspiration of Soldat. The main difference is mainly the way you control the game, i.e. with mouse aim cursor in Soldat, and purely with keyboard in Liero. And also the ninja rope.Once we added mouse aim support to OpenLieroX as well, but the Liero community didn&#39;t liked it, and basically it became another game. Network play between both versions would be unfair. It would really need a different name.Teeworlds (https://www.teeworlds.com/) is also a more recent very similar game, also with mouse aim, and ninja rope.Interesting also that Soldat is implemented in Free Pascal / Lazarus."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"What a surprise to see Soldat on hackernews :)I maintained Soldat back from version 1.5+ to 1.7 before someone else took over for a few years.The current version on Steam is Soldat 1.7 while the open source version is an unfinished Soldat 1.8 and needs some love before it can be released (gui is missing, new netcode, switch to lazarus/fpc, macOS and GNU/Linux support, new config file format to name a few.)So don&#39;t expect everything to work out of the box if you compile it.Any help is welcome btw ;)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Looks super fun, I&#39;ll give it a try!Something like 10 years ago I had a similar idea - a 2D shooter with the feel and gameplay of a FPS, only that in my case I thought of making it top-down, and the plan was that visibility would be a huge thing - your 2D character would only see things from their point of view that weren&#39;t blocked by the level geometry or other players.I never completed that game, for various reasons. But in the course of making that prototype, I did a lot of research about the networking model. I read every article I could find about client-side prediction, server reconciliation, and entity interpolation. I didn&#39;t want all this effort to go to waste, so I wrote what I had learned in article form, and put it on my website.That&#39;s the never-told-before origin story of my multiplayer networking articles :)https://gabrielgambetta.com/client-server-game-architecture...."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Internet-accessble industrial control systems have been a problem for many years now. It&#39;s a documented issue but it&#39;s difficult to fix for a variety of reasons:1. Difficult to identify the owner: a lot of the devices are on mobile networks that don&#39;t point to an obvious owner.2. Unknown criticality: is it a demo system or something used in production?3. Security budget: lots of smaller utilities don&#39;t have a budget for buying cyber security products.4. Uneducated vendor: sometimes the vendors of the device give very bad advice (https://blog.shodan.io/why-control-systems-are-on-the-intern...)That being said, based on the numbers in Shodan the situation has improved over the past decade. And there&#39;s been a large resurgence of startups in the ICS space (ex https://www.dragos.com, https://www.gravwell.io). Here&#39;s a current view of exposed industrial devices on the Internet:https://beta.shodan.io/search/report?query=tag%3Aics&amp;title=I...I&#39;ve written/ presented on the issue a few times:https://blog.shodan.io/taking-things-offline-is-hard/https://blog.shodan.io/trends-in-internet-exposure/https://exposure.shodan.io/#/"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"from https://twitter.com/zackwhittaker/status/1358868187656388611:    I can&#39;t immediately verify the veracity of the claims made by the sheriff but,
    the fact that the authorities *set up* a public-facing and/or remotely
    accessible system that allowed someone to change the water chemical levels is by
    far the bigger issue here."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"As someone who has some experience with hydroxide and water-treatment systems (as well as other potentially-dangerous industrial controls): always design your system such that even if your feed pump runs full-bore continuously, the system cannot harm anyone.The dilution of the solution stored in the hydroxide tank generally allows you to make this so.Sleeping well at night is a great side-effect."</p>

You can then add tunnels.     ssh&gt;
     ssh&gt; -L 8000:localhost:9000 
     Forwarding port."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"There&#39;s a really fancy new -R feature that I love (added in 2017 I think).ssh &lt;target&gt; -R &lt;just a port number&gt;This opens up a localhost port on the target that acts as a socks server which tunnels all your traffic through the source machine.This is great for machines that you can SSH into, but are otherwise completely isolated from the network, or are monitored heavily. You can jump on, and pull down everything you need from the existing SSH connection, rather than using the machine to make requests out to the internet directly.This is also good if the source machine is a web server or something on a secured network which can SSH out, but not much else, and the destination is your command and control server on the internet. Then it opens up a socks port on the C&amp;C machine that gives full access to the internal network, impersonating the source machine.Every other -R is a point to point TCP connection, but setting up a SOCKS proxy with -R is magic. More analogous to a reverse -D than a reverse -L. Super useful."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The leaked internal slides from Intuit are really disgusting [0][1].From the article:&gt; Internal presentations lay out company tactics for fighting “encroachment,” Intuit’s catchall term for any government initiative to make filing taxes easier — such as creating a free government filing system or pre-filling people’s returns with payroll or other data the IRS already has. “For a decade proposals have sought to create IRS tax software or a ReturnFree Tax System; All were stopped,” reads a confidential 2007 PowerPoint presentation from an Intuit board of directors meeting. The company’s 2014-15 plan included manufacturing “3rd-party grass roots” support. “Buy ads for op-eds/editorials/stories in African American and Latino media,” one internal PowerPoint slide states.I&#39;m always stunned and disappointed at how easy it is to game the American political system. I say that with great respect for this country and the freedoms it affords me, but those freedoms mean little if skullduggery like this goes on.[0]: https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/6483065-Intuit-board...[1]: https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/6483061-Intuit-Turbo..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;ve always been under the IRS Free File income threshold (I&#39;ve worked as a high school teacher and am now in grad school), but last year after reading this article was the first time I actually filed for free. That was after 5 years of paying for deluxe TurboTax.I had heard the government required TurboTax to have a free edition. But back in 2019 (and before), if you Googled &#34;TurboTax free&#34; you&#39;d be taken to a decoy free edition; the real one was called their &#34;freedom edition,&#34; and was hidden from Google&#39;s listings. If your tax situation is &#39;too complicated,&#39; the free edition tries to upsell you to the &#34;deluxe edition,&#34; even if the &#34;freedom edition&#34; could have handled the situation just fine.Thankfully now you can find the actual free version on Google, but it&#39;s still very confusing that the &#34;free edition&#34; is less free than the (still somewhat hidden) IRS Free File (&#34;freedom&#34;) version. And the faux Free Edition is still being heavily advertised."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Intuit is truly a scummy company with the way they behave here and elsewhere.  A simple example of one of these behaviors is that you cannot export data as CSV from Quickbooks Online, instead if only exports as a PDF or as an Excel XLSX file.  But the XLSX is carefully crafted so it reads out zeroes (0s) in all value fields if opened with LibreOffice or any conversion tools to get a CSV.Why do I know this?  I don&#39;t have any Windows computers, I mostly work on a Mac, and Intuit doesn&#39;t make TurboTax Business for Mac, only for Windows.  TaxAct has an online service for filing 1120S/K-1 for LLCs which can import data via CSV that works on any OS, so Intuit responded by no longer offering CSV exports and ensuring they&#39;re broken using F/OSS tools.  Really is making it a challenge to comply with the law this year for my LLC without me having to have Windows + Office 365 licenses."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Teletypes in Switzerland were ITU V.21 with three modifications:- 110 baud instead of 300 baud- not full duplex- carrier toneI experimented with a Java application and FFT to try to write a soft modem, so I still know the exact specification by heart. Bit 1 was 960 Hz, Bit 0 was 1160 Hz, the carrier tone 1060 Hz, and there were 2 stop bits. This means, the teletype could transmit 11 letters a second.The carrier tone is special: if someone stopped typing, the teletype switched to the carrier tone and kept it on for about 3 seconds then stopped.Being not full-duplex Deaf users used a convention so they know when they can type. The called party begins typing and ends with two stars, like this **. Then the caller knows he can type and also indicates the end with two stars. When a party is ready to hang up the phone he writes four stars.This is what my model (Telescrit) looked like: https://db1.rehadat.de/rehadat/bilder/TC058000/tc058773.jpg"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Working in IT, the vast majority of engineers and IT adjacent people have little care or desire to learn about phone or communications systems. Especially nowadays when Teams and Zoom take care of your VoIP woes on the backend, and AWS or Azure are always doing something way cooler than a PBX can.I was lucky to work alongside an enterprise PBX architect and not only learn about phone systems, but come to appreciate the history of them as well. One of the more interesting things to me has always been the amount of accessibility that gets designed into phone systems. TTY, translation services, different languages, etc. It&#39;s something that always reminds me we&#39;re designing and dealing with a wide variety of humans that I don&#39;t get when designing a network."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This engineer inventor changed my great uncle’s life. My great uncle got scarlet fever at age 8 in the 1930s and had a fever of 108 F and nearly died. Because of nerve damage to his ear from the fever, he became completely Deaf at age 11. He learned how to lip read on his own and graduated high school when usually people like him would typically be excluded. Nothing stopped him. He even fished the fertile Pacific Ocean waters for Alaskan Salmon for a living, which was obviously extremely dangerous for anyone.Some of my best memories of my grandmother and her brother (my great uncle) as a kid were at my grandmother’s house, whenever she had a phone call from her brother. Her talking to her brother via a physical TTY terminal with the phone handset in the terminal receiver was just so fascinating, captivating and interesting to see in the 90s as a kid."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"As an (European) outsider: Manufacturing consent is a key feature of societies. If societies are not just an accidental aggregation, but do have some actual cohesion, a core body (canon) of shared believes and opinions is absolutely necessary. If a society fails to manufacture consent as a common point of reference in this core domain, we may even speak of a failed society.A certain amount of mis- and disinformation, manipulation, falsely raised expectations (e.g., if masks do not stop CV19 dead in the track, it&#39;s also not a viable tool of mitigation), etc, is to be expected. A certain amount of dissent is vital to a thriving society, as opposed to a slow descent into dogmatism. A certain amount of dysfunctionality is actually functional to societies. However, if we are losing a common point of reference and the discussion turns from an ever varying problem space towards questioning and problematizing consent per se, society itself is at stake, as partitioning and claims to rightful dominance by one side or the other are inevitable. Dealing with this is not a matter of free speech, even, if suppression of free speech may be empirically observed as an – mostly failed – attempt to address this. It&#39;s actually more connected to the question, what speaking freely actually means: Is it to enter into or to contribute to a discussion, or is it a means of claiming dominance? In other words, does the address include those who do not share the specific set of believes and points of reference of the speaker, or does it exclude and/or ignore them, by this turning into an hermetic or even radical argument, meant only to augment the position of the speaker? Is it still pervasive, or has this turned into a hegemonial discourse? If it&#39;s the latter, it&#39;s not about manufacturing consent anymore, but about establishing a new, biased one, probably by force."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I find it hilarious that so much disinformation went into this article itself. The mischaracterizations of Fauci and the reckless, the poor sources that themselves are spin machines, all highlight a lot of the issues: a spectrum of people hell bent on manufacturing distrust in various institutions for their own gains, now co-adopted as an identity by the GOP.We need to find a way to fundamentally change the incentives in media, change the public’s expectation of separating opinion versus news, and remove the cancer(s) of “think tanks” that only serve to undermine and destroy."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"While it is true that we should be having a discussion about what really constitutes disinformation in a way that treats the concept as more than just a political tactic, this article reads as though it is doing almost the same thing. The bit about disinformation functions like a subterfuge to really assert what seem like the author&#39;s political views: covid skepticism, russiagate, ... If there is anything worse than throwing around the term disinformation to summarily dismiss ideas one disagrees with, it is having a discussion about this practice to underhandedly characterize ones own ideas as being &#34;actually&#34; true; as though these ideas are merely examples of real &#34;fact-based&#34; discourse. It is frustrating to see someone broach an important topic, then author between the lines of the discussion more of the very same problem."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Transparent Wood Composites [1] &#34;are novel wood materials which have up to 90% transparency and higher mechanical properties than wood itself&#34;. This latest paper Solar-assisted fabrication of large-scale, patternable transparent wood [2] describes a technique that brings this material one step closer to production scale:&gt; Here, we report a method to produce optically transparent wood by modifying the wood’s lignin structure using a solar-assisted chemical brushing approach. This method preserves most of the lignin to act as a binder, providing a robust wood scaffold for polymer infiltration while greatly reducing the chemical and energy consumption as well as processing time. The obtained transparent wood (~1 mm in thickness) demonstrates a high transmittance (&gt;90%), high haze (&gt;60%), and excellent light-guiding effect over visible wavelength. Furthermore, we can achieve diverse patterns directly on wood surfaces using this approach, which endows transparent wood with excellent patternability. Combining its efficient, patternable, and scalable production, this transparent wood is a promising candidate for applications in energy-efficient buildings.This same group has previously described A Clear, Strong, and Thermally Insulated Transparent Wood for Energy Efficient Windows [3].[1] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transparent_wood_composites[2] https://advances.sciencemag.org/content/7/5/eabd7342[3] https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/adfm.2019075..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I’m really disappointed with this narrative that natural fibres infused with chemicals are somehow still natural.“Bamboo fibre” bowls made with plastic for a recent trend: Not just not biodegradable as the name suggests, but also not recyclable.Like “vegan leather” (made from processed crude oil), these terms only seem to take us away from the products that we are actually looking for when something says “natural”."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Because it&#39;s hidden in one of the captions:The volume fraction of wood in the resulting product appears to be around 33%. So by volume it&#39;s two-thirds resin and one-third wood.I was hoping the wood fraction would be slightly higher to justify calling it &#34;transparent wood&#34;."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I have plenty of criticism of the blockchain hype, but IBM does this for all buzzwords regardless of how useful the underlying technology is. It is all marketing to get executives at large companies to cut large checks. Once those checks are cashed they drop everyone and move on to the next buzzword.The current buzzword is hybrid cloud. Which is awesome for IBM because most large companies already have some on-prem and cloud resources. So IBM inserts a bunch of people into existing processes and resources and claims credit for creating a hybrid cloud for their customers."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The point about theory-building requiring (or at least being accelerated by) interpersonal communication / teaching rings very true.In the middle of last year, my team went through a major re-org, and I&#39;m now working with a whole bunch of new teammates. My project didn&#39;t get cancelled in the reorg; in fact, it&#39;s actually come to more prominence due to synergy in the projects we work on. Essentially my new teammates are working on applications which have 2-4 years of catching up to reach the same level of maturity as my existing work.It&#39;s taken me the better part of a year to communicate the whys, whats, and hows of the systems we&#39;ve built. I&#39;ve given multiple talks, explained in 1:1s, written docs, and it&#39;s just taken a really long time to get across these ideas. All-remote work has definitely made a big (negative) impact in the velocity that ideas can be communicated."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I am sometimes guilty of reading the comments before reading the article. I often find the reactions more concise, insightful, and valuable to me than the source material.That said:If you are reading this comment and haven’t read the article, go read the article instead.This is an inverse scenario: imho most of the comments here are interesting but have only marginal value building from the insight of the article."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&#34;Worthless&#34; is an exaggeration: any significant body of code running a critical business process would be missed---and expensive to recreate---if it were lost. But I think the article does make a good point about the value to others. Unless you have a dev team whose head is in that code, and a business team built around that software workflow, just having the code won&#39;t be of much value to you. The value of software is inextricably linked to the team that has shaped it. So while it isn&#39;t worthless, it is certainly of much lower value without that team."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Ah, we actually have one of these at Caddy: https://caddyserver.com/docs/architecture(The filename on disk is literally &#34;architecture.md&#34; -- it is a Markdown file rendered by Caddy&#39;s template handler: https://github.com/caddyserver/website/blob/master/src/docs/...)It could use some improvement, but it&#39;s been really great for helping people learn how Caddy 2 works at a high level. Beyond our docs, I always encourage new contributors to thoroughly explore the godoc and code: it&#39;s very well-commented and organized, especially once you know how it all comes together. A single document will never be sufficient. But it can help you map between concepts and code.Code search is also invaluable for this; I recommend Sourcegraph: https://sourcegraph.com/github.com/caddyserver/caddyEdit: One other valuable piece is explaining why the architecture is the way it is. Our architecture.md doc links to a video that explains how I arrived at Caddy 2&#39;s architecture (and why it&#39;s not arbitrary): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EhJO8giOqQs"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I have a similar advice, but I will go one step further: add README.md to other folders as well. It is dope to have a map of your whole system in an Architecture.md (or a README if it&#39;s not too long), but it&#39;s even more dope to be able to click through it and have submaps of how other components are structured.Displaying the folder/file structure and explaining what is what is a must. An example from Diem[1]:  consensus
  ├── src
  │   ├── block_storage          # In-memory storage of blocks and related data structures
  │   ├── consensusdb            # Database interaction to persist consensus data for safety and liveness
  │   ├── liveness               # RoundState, proposer, and other liveness related code
  │   └── test_utils             # Mock implementations that are used for testing only
  └── consensus-types            # Consensus data types (i.e. quorum certificates)
  └── safety-rules               # Safety (voting) rules


I recently digged into dependabot&#39;s code, and I found it extremely well structured. For example you have an Architecture section in the first README[2] with a diagram (how awesome is that!) and with links to the README of all the sub components, which themselves live in the subfolders[3].What I dread the most is going through a new codebase and not seeing any documentation in internal packages. Like how the fuck am I supposed to understand anything in there? By reading all the code?[1]: https://github.com/diem/diem/tree/master/consensus#how-is-th...[2]: https://github.com/dependabot/dependabot-core#architecture[3]: https://github.com/dependabot/dependabot-core/blob/main/comm..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"As someone who is in week two of spooling up on a multi-million-line codebase where most of the original authors have moved on to other projects, please, I beg you to heed this advice. I spend the vast majority of my time figuring out where a change needs to happen. The patches themselves are no more than 10% of the work.(The other significant factor is running tests.)"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I like spyder a lot for the variable explorer, which makes it feel more like Matlab.  However the constant bothering about installing Kite got annoying. Unfortunately there isn&#39;t a way to use Kite and have it not constantly annoy you about upgrading to the enterprise edition. If Kite had a no ads plan for like ~ $10  a year it would make a lot more sense to integrate it in spyder."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"It often causes a double-take for me when I see projects on HN with the same name as projects I once worked on.Way back in time, maybe around 1998, a friend an I worked on a steganography tool that we called Spyder. I don&#39;t remember where it was published or under what license (probably freeware), but the algorithm was incorporated into Hide4PGP (http://www.heinz-repp.onlinehome.de/Hide4PGP.htm), and we stopped work on it.This post just caused a bit of nostalgia. I can still remember my co-developer taking a break jamming on a bass guitar while we tried to figure out the striping problem (the solution was to compress the data to increase entropy first)."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Can I get the following behavior from Spyder (last time I tried I couldn&#39;t find a way) - for some keyboard shortcut like Cmd/Ctrl + Enter:- the shortcut sends the selected code to the terminal (this is possible)- if I hit the shortcut when nothing is selected, the line where the cursor currently is gets sent to the terminal and the cursor moves to the next line of code- if the cursor is at the beginning of a block of code like an if-statement or a loop, the whole statement is sent to the terminal and the cursor moves to after the statementRStudio has this behaviour by default, I find it very convenient and I haven&#39;t been able to replicate it in other environments."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I&#39;ve seen many possible explanations mentioned. Most common seems to be that raising daughters is more stressful than raising sons (for various reasons) leading to more arguments etc. Most intriguing might be that sons conceived into tenuous marriages don&#39;t even make it out of the womb. I&#39;ll add one more: mother/daughter friction. I can&#39;t even count the number of families I&#39;ve seen in which a mother feels betrayed when her daughter doesn&#39;t follow her example in everything, and lets those feelings show. I&#39;ve seen the same with father/son, though less so perhaps because mothers tend to be more active parents. It would also be foolish to ignore the issue of daughters growing into their adult bodies and becoming sexually active right when many mothers are feeling insecure about their own attractiveness. We can argue about causes, but the effect is real.When mothers and daughters fight, it always puts fathers in a difficult position. A dad who consistently sides the mother might get credit for being a good co-parent (usually not) but be alienated from their own child. A dad who consistently sides with the daughter is likely to lose all contact with either due to divorce. All this, regardless of who&#39;s right or wrong between the two. Again, a bit of this happens when fathers and sons are in conflict, but it doesn&#39;t seem quite as severe and has different potential outcomes because of how &#34;family&#34; court works.That&#39;s just one possible factor, affecting some cases, but it seems worth mentioning along with all the others."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; parents of teenage daughters argue more about parenting than do the parents of sonsFrom my own experience. When my daughter hit 12 it was a fucking nightmare. The hormones hit girls hard and they can become incredibly difficult. That said, now she’s 13 things are much easier and look to be getting easier by the week. Although my wife and I both have to be very understanding and on the same team to deal with difficult behaviour — we have a lot of strategy meetings.Lacking empathy, and wanting independence without responsibility are part of being a teenager. But 12-year old girls can sometimes be super charged griefers.On the flip side, teenagers are actually awesome to hang out with and total joys full of creativity and fun — if you work through the refusal to clean their room, general lack of hygiene and the drama."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2014/12/why-women-s-bodies-a...Male fetuses are more likely to die in the womb if the mother is stressed. Marriages are more likely to end if the marriage is stressful. Therefore, marriages with first born daughters are more likely to end with divorce, by no fault of the daughter.Disclosure: I was once a first-born teenage daughter. Yes, my parents divorced."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I&#39;ve been keeping an eye on this one, it&#39;s not quite there yet if you are looking for a game to play. However, it has a massive amount of potential, and I&#39;m looking forward to seeing where it goes from here.I&#39;ve also read the code looking for examples of how to do things in Rust, and found it quite pleasant."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Context:
For those of you who still remember it, CubeWorld was a Minecraft-like RPG game that had a wildly popular Alpha, was eventually abandoned by its developer, was later revived, and was then universally vilified by the masses because the developers &#34;ruined&#34; the game.Veloren is the spiritual successor to CubeWorld, made by disappointed fans wanting something better."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I recently had the (possibly flawed) epiphany that all behavior is emergent. If you think about it, all things that we consider objects are just semi-permanent aggregations of fundamental particles that we recognize and label as objects for convenience of thought. When the patterns in such aggregations are outside the space and time scales that allow human minds to recognize them, the only label available is &#34;complex&#34;."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Bear in mind that the iPad was rumored to cost &gt;$1000 but then launched at $499.On the other hand it might sense to launch this as a pro-workstation for the usual kinds of task: architects, designers and engineers being able to visualize and interact with models directly in space.If they can make that affordable and usable for pro designers at every level, (which $3500 clearly would be), they will have a hit.
A consumer gaming device can come later."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I could see this as a virtual office, as some of the comments speculate.If I had a set of AR glasses that projected what appeared to be an 8K monitor on top of my dining room table, and integrated with my MacBook Pro for input / output, and that had batteries to last a workday, I’d pay $2K/$3K. Even more if it worked well at brightness levels I’d have in my backyard.Never mind gaming, mobile high-quality virtual office is good enough."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The #1 use of VR headsets is porn and porn apps are growing. Porn apps have some advantages over video apps because* a VR porn app is 6DOF, VR video is 3DOF
* a VR porn character has more presence. Their eyes can follow you, they can turn to face you, they can reach to your face, hands.
* You can interact at a VR character. You can&#39;t with a videoIn other words, either Apple is going to need to support porn apps on the the app store or they&#39;re going to need to allow 3rd party stores."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"There&#39;s a launcher called BaldPhone, which looks pretty big-shaped and high-contrast, and also open-source: https://baldphone.comPresumably there are Android phones with oldschool physical navigation buttons—at least there were back when the sky was bluer and the grass greener.Dunno how the launcher is on the configuration side. But in general I&#39;m sorta attracted to the idea of using it myself. There&#39;s the rawness and clarity akin to modernism."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; In the past, she memorized the number of presses on the “down” key that were required to scroll through her phone book to call someone.Some things are lost when everything is touch. I remember writing fast on T9 keyboards, and with time learning the order of suggestions it was trivial to text without even looking.There are also certain games that are hard to play on touch screens. I remember having a gameboy emulator on my old phone, using the number keys for some fast paced games. The same games are impossible to play on touch without feel for the buttons, a lot of misclicking."</p>
