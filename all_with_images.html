								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I will share my solution:If I have something that spies 24/7 in my home or around me I throw it in the recycle bin.No more tech talk, implementation talk on closed software and dark pattern designed products by any company.Apple is using its market leader in &#34;user convenience&#34; position to normalize on device user behavior analysis and data processing and active policing. This is madness.I expect police and three letter agencies to use their own hacking tools and budget. I will not pay the bill on a multiple levels to be monitored and classified. Yes you can vote with your wallet as first reaction, as second you can push your representatives for political and legislative reaction.Imagine this news in 2010. For sure some Apple stores will be burned down to the ground.But make no mistake:
If you don&#39;t buy products created from the get go to snoop around and extract your data, you will have more privacy.The only way into the future for people who want peace of mind is not to buy into 
smart home, smart appliances, smart cars and smart surveillance. Period.They are called smart for a reason. Because we are becoming stupider.Start self-hosting and local backups, there are tech savvy people who are moving away from surveillance state and building more private and sustainable future for themselves.Apple is the big writing on the wall. They act as political entity now, the users are their voters and as a classic politics move they are selling the audience to the highest bidder.Checks and balances."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The problem here is similar to what happens with the War on Terror.1) It is noted that governments could, in theory, be spying on everything. Widely dismissed as silly.2) There is a trigger event (eg, 9/11). Inside government, a standard slips. They start spying on everything.3) Years later it becomes public knowledge. It is too hard to monitor what is going on now though, so it is difficult to tell who specifically should be outraged about what.4) The situation persists because it is convenient to the people in charge.5) (TBD) It gets turned on political dissidents. I&#39;m expecting everyone will agree on this point in 5 or so years, at the moment that is probably maybe more a partisan observation.Apple&#39;s partnering up will follow the same pattern. There just isn&#39;t enough transparency about what closed source software does."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Here&#39;s an interesting thought experiment for anyone who disagrees that the proposed system is problematic.Let&#39;s say the police installs a new device in your house. This device could be capable of seeing or hearing anything that happens in your entire home. However, the police claim that the device is only watching a specific door in your house and forwarding encrypted low resolution photos to their servers &#34;just in case&#34; some criteria is met and they need to take a look. Nevermind that it would only take a policy change and an OTA update that you have no visibility into, or chance of blocking, before it&#39;s watching your entire house in real-time and sending practically anything to their servers. After all, they did release a carefully worded statement regarding what the device supposedly does.But hey, you have several other doors to enter or exit your house from so what&#39;s the big deal right? You could seal that door and never be subjected to the system _as advertised_.Would you trust the police in that scenario, regardless of whether you have anything to hide?"</p>

Nothing wrong with people having tattoos everywhere, green or violet hair, non conformist clothing and views. Let them be, let them express and find themselves.I am the shave every day suit kinda guy and will remain so, but if someone chooses to be different or wants to complain about new woke culture values , fine by me.There&#39;s not more or less trans and gay people these days, they are just more visible and have a voice, as they won&#39;t be burned at a stake anymore, metaphorically speaking."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Some weird random anecdote about Back Orifice 2000 (BO2k) that nobody asked for:We were goofing around in high school with this. Putting it on computers in school and messing around. We sent it over to a classmate. Her father was teachter and we figured she might open it on their home PC. (we were 14 at the time, by the way).Anyway, we made a fake hotmail address in the name of another classmate. These two people didn&#39;t share any classes and were not in eachother little social circle. We sent a couple of emails back and forth pretending to be the other guy but lost interest along the way and nothing happend.Now for the strange part; forward 18 years or so. I&#39;m in the city, I run into the person who we were sending the messages to... with the person who we were pretending to be. Married and 3 children together.I&#39;d like to think we brought them together in some strange way."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Oh man, yeah also adding to the list of people that abused their highschool computer labs with this.  We had so much fun, but we eventually drew the ire of the school IT admin.  After class one day the teacher took us aside with the admin and asked if we had installed BO on the computers, which we of course denied... they &#34;believed&#34; us, heh, but gave us a stern warning that whoever was doing it should stop.  We would have all probably ended up with felony charges these days.The next year, so 1999, we actually got approval to attempt to change our grades as an exercise.  We actually managed to do it by sneakily copying a floppy one of the teachers used to store their grades with a program called Integrade. We took it home, reverse engineered the password protection to disable it, changed our grades on the copy, re-enable the password protection with the original password, and turned that in as our proof. Our teacher was impressed and super sketched out/nervous at the same time. I guess they never considered we&#39;d succeed and get access to the whole class&#39;s grades..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Hi party people, this is Sir Dystic, author of the original 1998 Back Orifice.  Great to hear all of you reminiscing about my software!One thing that I did not predict when I released BO:  The distribution ZIP contained three files, a readme.txt, the BO server and the BO client.  In retrospect, the BO server should probably not have been distributed with the original .EXE extension as a LARGE portion of people apparently downloaded the ZIP, unzipped it and just double clicked on the BO server, immediately infecting themselves.Keep disturbing shit please...--oo] ooM [oo--.."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&gt;Microsoft declined to comment specifically on Bill’s research, but said customers can block the overwhelming majority of account takeover efforts by enabling multi-factor authentication.Or, of course, by not reusing passwords everywhere. ISPs can help by turning on some sort of brute force protection on SMTP and IMAP. They can also help by checking for completely obvious passwords (yes, by brute force cracking with a short list). Which brings us to this:&gt;But you also know they are accessing their email exclusively through an email client. What do you do? You can’t flag their account for a password reset, because there’s no mechanism in the email client to affect a password change.”If only there was some way to communicate with a email customer..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Can we talk about who &#34;Bill&#34; (the source for the article) is ?If we read between the lines, it appears that someone sitting at a fairly large Internet choke point is grepping the flow of mail traffic for keywords (for lack of better terms since it&#39;s not literally grep).Presumably someone placed highly enough that they can do such analysis without management oversight ?Or are there compliance and security reasons to &#34;grep&#34; IMAP traffic for certain things and he just added some other keywords ?Where, in 2021, would a network admin own this much traffic and have this little oversight ?-----EDIT: ... and now that I think about it, wouldn&#39;t this be fairly easy to suss out ?  The source states:&#34;So I’m seeing this traffic to just like 10 net blocks tied to Microsoft, which means I’m only looking at maybe 25 percent of Microsoft’s infrastructure,&#34;I have neither the time nor the inclination but if there is an ISP out there that is routing 25% of MS mail infrastructure, all I have to do is look at mail routes to MS for a few days and run some traceroutes and I could probably make some guesses as to which network &#34;Bill&#34; works for ..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Ironically, I could see people actually paying for this service by splitting the &#34;gift cards&#34; etc. that are found.Essentially, it&#39;s an automated service to find all of the places where programs give you free stuff for little or no work, and then their system just watches your email and does it for you, splitting the final values in some fashion.Despite the extreme security issues around it, I could many people signing up for this."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Shameless plug: I wrote undocker[1] to convert docker images to a rootfs tarball, so I can run them with plain systemd.Goal: no more daemons to run 3rd party containers, systemd is good enough by now: resource limits, isolation, chroot, dynamic users, logging, and more.Low-level tooling is done, I am now building ecosystem around it: easy installation, convert to deb/rpm, systemd units, etc.[1]: https://sr.ht/~motiejus/undocker"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Ive been using Podman for a while for my non-Kubernetes cloud deployments (i.e. small VM based things).It&#39;s worked very well for me after a few initial hiccups a year or so ago.Now that Podman-compose[0] is in the works, it&#39;ll really be comparable in the UX space soon, and outperforms Docker in several ways when it comes to security.The key difference with Podman compared to Docker is that is does not run a deamon as root, like Docker does, thus all containers are created with the privilege level of the user who created it.This can be a learning curve for those used to Docker as privileges (e.g. for filesystems, files) and capabilities (e.g. for devices,  low level networking) need to be handled more explicitly as opposed to Docker&#39;s approach of &#34;simon (root) says&#34;.Additionally, Podman is very light weight due to the lack of a daemon since there is no service or supporting software which needs to run beyond the capabilities baked into Linux.[0] https://github.com/containers/podman-composeEDIT TO ADD: I run Linux both on desktop and server so I have no data for usage in Windows/Mac. Docker Desktop, as I understand it, is a Linux VM."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I see all comments here and I’m wondering if anybody actually read TFA.This is NOT a drop-in replacement on Mac, very far from it.No volumes mount from the host, no auto port forward, complications when building images, bugs where the socket isn’t cleared etc.They will get there eventually but this is way over hyped for a sensible replacement for docker on Mac."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"While it is obviously not unrelated to the pandemic chaos, there is a deeper issue.  As Nassim Taleb has often pointed out, the same things that make a system &#34;efficient&#34; also can often be viewed as making it fragile.  &#34;Just-in-time&#34; means &#34;no buffer&#34;.  We have, for decades, been doing as much as possible to make all our economic systems as efficient as possible, which is to say with no extra capacity.Thus, if it had not been the pandemic, it would eventually have been something else.  Sooner or later, there is always a shock to the system.  If you have made sure that every step in a long complex chain is optimized to have very little slack, the thing you have optimized for is fragility."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Old article May 5th of this year, which in that industry is a long time. 
Nevertheless the situation since did actually get worse as predicted. Not only is it chip shortage we should call it component shortage. A standard 10k 0406 package resistor is sold out around the world. Many high quality, high density capacitor you can&#39;t get. The same goes for the standard semiconductor parts like diodes, MOSFET or TVS. 
Semiconductor sales rep give you now +50 weeks lead time for the many ICs meaning no real forecast at this point. 
They generally tell you 2022 will be tough maybe Q4 will ease up.Many of the major semi companies are running at fairly high capacity, but supporting elements like IC package build capacity, sometimes materials can&#39;t keep up as well.We looked at some boards to redesign, but when you are short hundreds of parts it gets nearly insurmountable to manage a hardware redesign. Interesting and challenging allocation period, definitely worse than 2003-2005."</p>

Looking at the strings output, we can see some interesting string references, including auth_admin_ssh_special and auth_admin_internal. Searching for auth_admin_internal finds the sub_13DBEC function. This function has a strcmp call that is not present in the 6.3.0r19b firmware:

  The argument to the strcmp call is &lt;&lt;&lt; %s(un=&#39;%s&#39;) = %u, which is the backdoor password, and was presumably chosen so that it would be mistaken for one of the many other debug format strings in the code. This password allows an attacker to bypass authentication through SSH and Telnet.

The hackers altered the algorithm so they could decipher encrypted data flowing through the virtual private network connections created by NetScreen devices. They returned in 2014 and added a separate backdoor that allowed them to directly access NetScreen products, according to the people and the document.Can we have more technical details regarding this?

There&#39;s something really weird about the contemporary Australian culture that&#39;s seems to be permitting increasingly authoritarian governance.If think if you asked my grandparents what defined &#39;being Australian&#39; it would be been belief in freedom, mateship and irreverence of authority."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;m unsurprised this is occurring in Australia.  Australia has for a long time now been pursuing policies which seem on their face to feel more at home in China.  I suspect for most Australians though, they&#39;ll just go along with this and there will be a greater proportion of tech-savvy people who find a way to dodge this and exclusively connect via VPN.It&#39;s becoming more and more commonplace for people outside the US to connect to the Internet exclusively via a VPN egress in the US, creating &#34;US-based&#34; online accounts, and operating online as if they were a US person.  It seems in the future this may be necessary just to experience the Internet with even basic expectations of free access and anonymity.As long as they continue to play ball geopolitically with the rest of the West, nobody is going to call them out, but the last decade in Australia has seen a significant curtailing of human rights.  The most surprising thing is that it seems few people are speaking out about it, generally."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I wonder if the legislation they passed within 24 hours allowing police to read/delete/edit social media posts of anybody without warrants is related to the australian truckers blocking off major highways in the past couple of days.Australia is more and more like China every day.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Personally I found most of those examples to be not great. I think they would be improved better names overall, more well named private methods and most importantly well structured companion test classes proving the behavior.I really dont want to read another developers comments on their mental state while I am feverishly debugging their code during a 3am page.The number of times I have been misled by an outdated comment. I generally open git blame to see if the comments predate any code now. Tests on the other hand almost never lie.Readmes or comments explaining why something exists vs what it allegedly does are generally much better. If you can’t write expressive code why would you assume your English is much better?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Speaking of source code comments, antirez (of Redis fame) wrote a fantastic article[0] about that topic some time ago and I still recommend it to colleagues whenever they make the hollow statement that &#34;code should and can be intelligible on its own, without any comments&#34;.[0]: https://web.archive.org/web/20210226004600/http://antirez.co... (I still don&#39;t understand why he deleted his blog)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"For the first example with conditions, I much prefer rolling the &#34;why&#34; of the comments into boolean variable names where possible e.g.   // We still have burst budget for *all* tokens requests.
   if self.one_time_burst &gt;= tokens {
      ...
   } else {
      // We still have burst budget for *some* of the tokens requests.

becomes something like   (I&#39;m   missing context   but you get the idea):   enoughBudgetForAllTokenRequests = self.one_time_burst &gt;= tokens

   if enoughBudgetForAllTokenRequests
      ...
   else
      ...

I don&#39;t see this often though. I see the commenting pattern a lot where the comment usually duplicates the &#34;what&#34; of the conditional code, and it&#39;s often ambiguous if the comment is talking about the condition or a whole branch.I think a descriptive variable makes the code easier to skim, it&#39;s more precise and less likely to become inaccurate. For a big complex conditional, you can break in up into several well-named boolean variables you compose together (but obviously comment the bits that can&#39;t be covered by a concise variable name)."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Wow, we made Apple blink. I did not see that coming. People like me who sold their iPhone and cancelled all services probably are a drop in the bucket, but it looks like the general public and the news picked up on this enough to get the ball rolling to make them step back. So now the question is in what 15.X update do they just sneak it in."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"In my opinion, Apple will break its brand if they actually go ahead and release &#34;self-reporting to the authorities&#34; device features.Even if they somehow manage to make it do exactly the thing it is supposed to do and not slide into a feature for mass governmental control, I think a lot of people will loose trust into the devices they own.Automatically scanning your stuff and reporting the bad things to the police is like the concept of God always watching. Even if you don&#39;t do anything wrong and you agree that the stuff they are watching for is bad and should be prevented, there is something eerie about always being watched and controlled.The iPhones should mind their own business and leave the police work to the police.That being said, I would be O.K. if the scan is performed on the device upon physical access by the authorities. You caught someone, You have enough evidence to investigate the person, you are allowed to search his/her home then maybe it can be O.K. to run a fingerprint scan on the phone to look for evidence."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"For everyone who is saying that the technical community “won”... Nobody’s been fired. Rather, Apple’s senior execs publicly doubled down and basically labeled those of us who thought this scheme to be insane, as a bunch of uninformed idiots...You can change a product decision in a day, but it takes a LONG time to change a culture that thinks these sort of insane product decisions make any sense whatsoever. Making a long-term bet on Apple has become precarious at best."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I&#39;ve been using this for a while. Very, very, very handy for- Just exploring some code.- Quickly pull up as reference code w/ decent navigation without having to checkout locally or navigate forward/back in the source tree in GitHub.- When reviewing PRs and wanting to check out some surrounding code that is not part of the actual PR.- If you want to quickly commit something really small and trivial in master/a branch/a PR without having to do the whole stash/checkout/pull/change/commit/push rigmarole (like if you&#39;re in the middle of doing something else).Things that are very annoying:- Some of the most used VSCode hotkeys are browser hotkeys, like Ctrl+T, Ctrl+P, Ctrl+Shift+P etc. The functions aren&#39;t even rebound to anything else, they&#39;re just not available via hotkeys.- Some extensions are not available, especially ones that (partially) may rely on some kind of local binary. I understand that, but that also sometimes rules out extensions that could partially work. Example: none of the Zig extensions work because they reference tooling binaries, so I can&#39;t even get syntax highlighting of Zig code. You could argue that&#39;s an extension packaging issue, however. That&#39;s fair.- The PR reviewing UI needs a lot of work, because right now it&#39;s not as good as the normal GitHub UI, so currently, for larger PRs, I need to have both UIs open.I hope in the future you can save a gist or something with custom settings/hotkeys/extensions to load. I&#39;m sure they&#39;re working on something like that.Update: Oh, there actually is some form of settings sync. Have to check that out."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"After reading the article one thing that struck me was the &#34; internal candidates who were rejected after interviewing with the hiring manager were half as likely to exit as those rejected earlier in the process.&#34;Working at a fortune 100 top 10 company I&#39;ve applied for multiple higher level positions after 5 years and multiple high marks on my reviews and not gotten 1 recruiter call. I did get with one recruiter and he told me one of the positions was actually only posted for someone internally and they didn&#39;t even interview anyone else. My resume looks good according to them its unclear why im being passed over. Ive not even gotten an interview and if i did i think i may feel like staying and trying to continue to pursue opportunities possibly.Its essentially soured me on company though - they have all these &#34;raise my hand&#34; type crap saying i want to be considered as a viable candiate for opportunity. They have multiple manager tools to flag people for opportunity which my manager has done for me. Yet here i am - ready to move up - put my 5 years in doing excellent work - and left hung out to dry when I&#39;m ready. So I&#39;m on the verge of moving elsewhere and my boss being &#34;shocked&#34; I&#39;m looking elsewhere and saying if I find anything else let him know and he&#39;ll see what he can do - well that ship has sailed."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I think hiring externally is often over valued in many organizations today.There is a number of reasons for this, but one is that if you hire someone external they are more under your control than an internal hire who already has ideas of how things should work and relationships and therefore has their own amount of political clout. A new hire has no reputation to lean on so must be a bit more cautious at first.Another reason is that there is a “grass is greener” mentality. You know what you like and don’t like about an internal hire. You don’t know what you like or dislike about the external hire yet, not really. Additionally, someone from outside may have the silver bullet to solve X,Y, or, Z problem that no one else can seem to solve. You know your internal candidates don’t have the quick easy solution you want, but maybe this new person will!** hint: They don’t."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Required reading for every technical leader: https://randsinrepose.com/archives/shields-down/&gt; Resignations happen in a moment, and it’s not when you declare, “I’m resigning.” The moment happened a long time ago when you received a random email from a good friend who asked, “I know you’re really happy with your current gig because you’ve been raving about it for a year, but would you like to come visit Our Company? No commitment. Just coffee.” ... Your shields are officially down.&gt; Your shields drop the moment you let a glimpse of a potential different future into your mind. It seems like a unconsidered off-the-cuff thought sans consequence, but the thought opens you to possibilities that did not exist the moment before the thought existed.&gt; Every moment as a leader is an opportunity to either strengthen or weaken shields. Every single moment.As a CTO of a young company, I start many mornings thinking about my team&#39;s shields. Am I asking them to focus on projects or parts of the stack they don&#39;t find interesting, or being less proactive than I should be in unblocking their needs? And most importantly, am I staying true to our values and providing them the transparency they need? Because if we get to the point where the OP article is, where team members want to find a different team, there is no other tech team they can transfer to, so their shields being down becomes a critical vulnerability! There&#39;s a balance, of course, and some weeks are just too chaotic to be perfect at this, but I try as much as I can. I like to think that this is also the type of environment that makes people the most creative they can be - it&#39;s a win-win for everyone."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&gt; Is GateBoy a perfect simulation of a Game Boy?&gt; Actually no, for complicated reasons. The Game Boy chip has a handful of logic gates that operate independently of the master clock and whose exact behavior depends on things like gate delay. These gates create glitches that depend heavily on the physical placement of the gates, the silicon process used to make them, and other weird things like temperature and voltage.This is fascinating, I previously would have assumed that a gate-level simulation would necessarily be perfect by definition."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"“We conclude that piracy and similar competitive shocks push firms to innovate to stay ahead of imitator products, and that this effect is moderated by their existing patent portfolios.”I guess it’s good to study that this is the case, but isn’t this exactly why companies fight piracy and attempt to patent and then enforce those patents? That is to reduce competition and make it easier to extract value from what they’ve produced?Basically, isn’t the premise that if privacy was rampant and patents didn’t exist then more people and companies would be able to innovate on the technology without fear of a lawsuit? I think of how stagnant the Eink space is, and how much broader usage might that technology get if it wasn’t encumbered by patents (just one example)?I guess I just don’t find this surprising."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&#34;Second, we build a dataset that matches the financial information of publicly traded software firms with (1) R&amp;D expenditures and patent, copyright, and trademark counts, and
(2) a unique dataset of pirated software.&#34;That&#39;s fine, but they&#39;re measuring what can be measured easily and calling it &#34;innovation&#34; (at least in the headline), rather than anything meaningful. Having more patent filings doesn&#39;t mean you&#39;re &#34;innovating&#34; more. Nor does spending more on &#34;R&amp;D&#34; which is mostly just an accounting convention.At two companies, I worked on getting more patent filings, because that was seen by management as The Thing To Do. In both cases, we would ask the engineers &#34;what have you done lately?&#34; and then decide if any of that might be patentable. Usually this involved paying a bounty to the &#34;inventor&#34; if a patent application was filed, and another if the patent actually issued (4-8 years later).In one case for awhile (Google Maps), they were actually paying people a bounty for submitting an idea for a patent, even if no application was filed! I was on the committee that decided if the idea was (1) great, file for sure, (2) pretty good, maybe file, (3) OK but don&#39;t file, or (4) so bad you don&#39;t even get the idea bounty.  (*Full disclosure: I&#39;m pretty sure this system isn&#39;t in effect anymore.*)

I&#39;ve written elsewhere [1] about the dubiousness of software patents, so I don&#39;t need to explain how they have nothing to do with &#34;innovation.&#34;[1] https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2399580"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"S. Korea gaming industry once suffered a lot from piracy in 90s. This was a main driver of their rapid transition toward online gaming. In fact, one of the earliest graphical MMORPG was invented by Nexon (a year before UO). Coincidentally, Nexon is also the inventor of loot box which becomes their dominant business model. And I think not many people prefer this over old fashioned game packages.So yeah, piracy could corner industry to &#34;innovate&#34; their product and business model in order to survive. But it&#39;s not guaranteed to be in a societally beneficial way."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"FYI: google&#39;s are Apache licensed here: https://github.com/googlefonts/noto-emojiTwitter emoji (discord uses these also) are open source: https://twemoji.twitter.com/Both of these are very consistent and good open source emoji. I think in the past a lot of these projects that were not backed by companies eventually devolved into a paid product that was no longer open source, but I&#39;m hopeful that openmoji continues down the FOSS path."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Emojis are normally used inlined in text. So, I think, they should demo theirs the same size as they would be when inlined in text. Otherwise hard to tell tell the emoji quality. 
I&#39;m also a bit concerned with the thick black outlines, they may look not as good at the small scale (may look too noisy or may overpower small color details)."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The last time I evaluated these for use in my app, I found that the &#34;consistent&#34; and &#34;minimalist&#34; visual style makes it really difficult to recognise object/plant/food emoji from one another by shape or at a distance. Other emoji have clear shapes, but not enough internal detail to understand what they mean. this is especially problematic with a set of non-Android, non-Twitter, non-Apple emoji, where users haven&#39;t learned the shapes yet, but have to go by looks. It looks like the creators of this project wanted &#34;function over form&#34;, or at least &#34;form follows function&#34;, but in their pursuit of Bauhaus they accidentally ended up with Droodles."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I am sorry but as an application developer, I think this is all wrong. I&#39;ll thank my infra team today for not being assholes like this guy.1. Application developers are your users. If we application developers took offense every time a user tells us that things are not working, we&#39;d be pretty pissed off all the time. Educating and empathizing with your users is part of your job.2. Talking about how it was better before: QA teams sure do buffer a lot of crap. They also cost a bunch and slow down time to release. Yes agile is causing problems. The bureaucracy and stiffness of organizations before agile was no nirvana either.3. By your own affirmation you treat applications as black boxes that should be deployed using a runbook that should just work. This is ridiculous. Application&#39;s ownership is shared between everyone who works on it.4. And yes, as developers, networking or physical drive space are things that we tend to abstract away. Maybe if the infrastructure people were involved in development discussion earlier, they&#39;d be able to raise their hands and say: wait a minute, you&#39;re going to blow up our logs.This all feels like someone who used to not do anything suddenly being asked to take part in what&#39;s happening...EDIT: apologies for the strong language and sounding like an asshole myself, but I certainly feel irritated when someone takes the time to write a 5000-word article complaining about whiny developers who thought they could own ops but actually don&#39;t know anything and scream for help when they themselves are the cause of all evil."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"From the article: ”Often they have not even bothered to do basic troubleshooting, things like read the documentation on what the error message is attempting to tell you.”This has been the bane of my work happiness for a while now. I keep having to tell junior devs to actually _read_ the fine error message, just in case it actually _contains information about the error_, you know. Not that it seems to help much, it’s like they can’t get the concept into their heads.This is 100% a problem with younger, bootcamp-”educated” devs, in my experience. I know the common wisdom on social media is ”no one reads text anymore”, but if that includes aspiring developers, it might be tough to replace the current workforce when that day comes…"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I think some of the article is framed wrong.  It&#39;s written as competent ops guy/team vs. incompetent developers.  But I don&#39;t think that&#39;s actually what&#39;s going on.  I&#39;m sure there are competent developers saying the exact same thing about their relatively incompetent ops people.We built a couple relatively simple applications for an enterprise client.  It took their ops teams months to get both applications running in K8s, even though our deliverable was a fully functioning container.  They were largely incompetent as far as we could tell.But, I don&#39;t think it&#39;s worth being unkind or judging them.  Every time they asked us a question we made an effort to point them in the right direction.  There were other times it was a problem we couldn&#39;t help with, we kindly let them know that.I think the reality is that the demand for competent IT and developers outpaced supply a long time ago and it&#39;s not getting better.  Those of us who know and care about the difference should make competent co-workers and executives part of the job evaluation.  Or, accept incompetence around you as a reality, help and avoid as wisdom dictates.But, complaining that it exists and framing it as competent ops vs incompetent developers is both untrue and unhelpful IMO.The latter part of the article that talks about the pace of features, complexity, and the lack of time is spot on though IMO.  I think the article would have been better focusing here and avoiding the IT vs devs angle."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"From a previous discussion:One very interesting piece of tech coming from podman, is toolbox (https://github.com/containers/toolbox). Basically throwaway (or keeparound) rootless containers with their own root directory but shared HOME. Install hundreds of dev-dependencies to build this one piece of software? Yeah, not gonna install those packages permanently. Spin up a toolbox, build it, install it in my home/.local.You have root in the container without having root in the host system. That takes care of a lot of issues as well.I basically no longer have development packages installed and run some applications with lots of dependencies out of toolboxes."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Podman is a great Docker alternative. That&#39;s why I already included it alongside Docker in https://deploymentfromscratch.com/. It fits nicely in the world of systemd services where Podman let&#39;s you run the container just as you would run the containerized service directly. I hope the future will be bright and maybe we won&#39;t need Docker the runtime anymore."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Some background info on mammograms (x-rays of the breast). For whatever reason breast cancer is highly political in the US. As a result there are federal laws regarding communication of results and scheduling follow-up exams that apply to mammograms only and no other radilody or other medical test. To comply with these laws radiologists set up a uniform grading system with highly specific jargon. As a result the formatting and language used in mammogram reads by radiologist will be much more consistent than, say, a chest x-ray screening for lung cancer. This makes mammograms the ideal studies to be tackled by AI"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This type of evaluation (both the meta-evaluation and the underlying studies themselves) are the exact sort things AI enthusiasts should want researchers to do. It cuts through the hype, and gives everyone a clear assessment of where the technology currently stands.Clearly there is room for improvement. Maybe this study will also spur the development of new types of systems which augment human/radiologist decision-making."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I think this headline is bad. When you read the abstract you find that what this is really saying is that there are essentially no studies that are fit for purpose to evaluate AI systems for breast screening in general and those that are the closest to being suitable show the worst results. That&#39;s the real take-away here - we&#39;re not even at the point where we&#39;re collecting good data about AI accuracy, let alone actually producing accurate AI.I would suggest these two things might be linked - the only way you get publishable results is by failing to do rigorous studies."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I feel like what hurts this the most is lack of brand recognition - half of the people in the comments are asking why they should trust them and rightfully so. When you look at the individual components, like Nextcloud, you know that the company behind that project is interested in making it work. You know that Nextcloud, GitLab and others make money through their enterprise offerings and probably aren&#39;t too interested in selling their users&#39; data or finding other alternative ways of monetizing their platforms.When a seemingly random company pops up and just rehosts a number of these FOSS platforms, you tend to be skeptical of their motivations or offerings, seeing as they make bold claims about otherwise insignificant platforms, especially given how often you hear untrue statements about privacy nowadays and even moreso if you don&#39;t know or care about their history: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenDesktop.orgPersonally, i applaud their efforts and attempts at popularizing these tools and platforms (as someone who self hosts OpenProject, Nextcloud, GitLab, Rocket.Chat and many other pieces of software that i use myself), however i fail to see where their target audience lies: the majority of people who don&#39;t care about their privacy will simply stick to the larger cloud offerings of Google or Microsoft office components and something like GitHub for their code, whereas the more privacy conscious folk are more likely to self host software or will need lots of time to build trust with them.I do hope that they have a sustainable existence and a net positive impact on the industry, though!"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"My own very minor gripe is with the maps component.Because it uses OpenStreetMap as a map source it doesn&#39;t show any settlements larger 250,000 for my area because those settlements call themselves &#34;towns&#34; and not &#34;cities&#34;.When you zoom out all you see is a blank space with no labels for quite a large area of the screen.Meanwhile very small settlements (&lt; 20K people) are shown at max zoom just because they happen to have the right kind of church building, which in the UK means they can call themselves &#34;cities&#34;.I&#39;ve raised this issue with OpenStreetMaps support for many years and they just either say it&#39;s something to be fixed by client libraries or it&#39;s not important.They could be right I guess.  However, Goople maps, Apple maps and Microsoft maps handle this correctly and that&#39;s what OpenDesktop explicitly say they are trying to replace here."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"When the Caldor fire (now 210  thousand acres, 328 mi^2!) was smoking up Placerville, the downtown Home Depot had, at the main entrance, a big stack of 20x24x1-inch #9 furnace filters, box fans, and rolls of tape, with one all constructed sitting on top, running, black with trapped smoke.Kudos to HD for not jacking up prices.It is best to make them with a four inch thick filter, which HD does not stock, and higher than a #9, likewise, bought online. You can stack a #8 in front of a #17, to make the ~$100 #17 last longer, and stack two box fans (one intake, one exhaust) to get more suction. Maybe stack #8/fan/#17/fan, to keep the fans clean.But the single one-inch #9 filter cleared the smoke from my whole house in no time flat! Don&#39;t let &#34;best&#34; stop you from doing &#34;good&#34;.An advantage you have from high airflow is that particles that make it through the filter once are likely to get trapped the next time around, or the 20th. Atomizing some water ought to make filters momentarily stickier, until it dries.Fan blades getting dusty can cut airflow in half! (Same on laptop cooling fans; use a vacuum cleaner on your laptop air path.)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Heres my set up:- 20 inch box fan- 20x20x4 MERV12 filter. The 4-inch pleating is key here, to reduce the air resistance on the box fan.- 1 inch dust pre-filter. This is course, low air resistance, and is for increasing the life of the more expensive MERV12/HEPA filter (so it doesn&#39;t get clogged with easy to filter dust).- Both filters are on the intake side of the box fan. This means you don&#39;t need a bungee cord because the intake has negative pressure, the filters just &#34;stick&#34;. It also means you keep your box fan flowing with only cleaned air.Heres a pic of my setup: https://imgur.com/a/O4I6UdxAnd here&#39;s a graph this morning from my air quality sensor, after turning on the fan/filter: https://imgur.com/a/c5GMNcCThe peak at ~30ug/m^3 PM2.5 is approximately 100 AQI. The fan was on the other side of my 900 sqft house from the sensor."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I built a &#34;four filter fan box&#34; this year when the smoke started rolling in (off MERV 13 filters, I think?), and have also gone about getting the measurement devices to verify that, yes, it really does work!  I used a round fan, and a lot of tape to seal things to the fan, though it appears this might not matter as much as I thought.  The filter area is sufficient that the fan doesn&#39;t really struggle - fan motors burning out from a single filter (as someone else reported) is a well known failure mode, and a good reason not to just strap filters flat to a fan.  They rely on the airflow to cool, and it&#39;s easy to screw that up.Air quality (in terms of PM2.5 and PM10, the stuff my testers measure) coming out of the fan is very good - far lower than the room, and the filter will start pulling down air particulates in a room fairly quickly.  If the room is around 5ug/m^3 PM2.5, the output from the fan is sub-1, and it moves enough air to do quite a few air exchanges per day.  It really does make a difference.I&#39;m using a couple Temtop meters to measure air quality, and while they&#39;re Chinesium, they do seem to work fairly well.Also, if you ever wondered: Use your stove&#39;s vent fans!  The air quality difference in PM2.5/PM10 between cooking without those running, vs cooking with them on, is HUGE!  I&#39;ll see spikes in the kitchen up well past 100ug/m^3 PM2.5 after browning meat, which is worse than it is outside in heavy forest fire smoke!https://www.sevarg.net/2021/08/28/temtop-air-quality-sensors..."</p>

Frequently when traveling you’ll get some fake hospitality experiences that end up just “gift shopping” but this experience was neat to me as they seemed just interested in travelers.I wonder how frequently they do that as the road wasn’t super busy, but also wasn’t abandoned. We maybe spent half an hour and no else came by."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Intereseting way of milking goats:https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-ZaZgfe2Gyk0/XqHI23JcnqI/AAAAAAAAW...The animals are in a line bunched up close and alternating facing so that one animal has its head on the shoulders of the two animals next to itself and looking towards their rear.I haven&#39;t seen that before. More peculiar is that I can&#39;t see them eating anything. Normally when animals are milked, it&#39;s lunch (or dinner) time. They line up in front of their troughs and they&#39;re milked while they eat. Typically there&#39;s some kind of divider or railing to keep them more or less still also. Otherwise you need to have really well disciplined and calm animals or you&#39;ll get lots of hooves in milk pots and so on.It&#39;s also very interesting to see how they dried their cheeses on top of their tents. These look like small, lactic cheeses. If they had a good source of salt they would probably be very high on salt both to help preserve and sanitise them and also to replenish the salt lost by the people to the heat of the desert. Anyway that must have been really strong cheese: sun-dried, very salty, goat&#39;s milk cheese. Yum."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"These photos are of stunning quality. I&#39;m not sure I&#39;ve seen any 19th century photos that come close, even with retouching and postprocessing. But also the lighting is incredible. Like it looks more like something associated with a more modern (ie post-WWII) technique.I didn&#39;t see any mention of the provenance of these photos. Anyone know?"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"My main technique from my engineering undergrad days was extremely effective and yet very simple and easy to describe and/or implement. It is:1. Attend the lectures and take good notes. Don&#39;t write things down that are obvious or that you already know.2. Before any exam, go back over the dozens of pages of notes and condense them down to 3 or 4 pages, omitting details that will be brought to mind by the things you are writing down.3. Go back over the 3 to 4 pages, condensing them down to a single page, compactly written.4. Go back over the single page, condensing it down to a single notecard.The act of condensing requires you to internalize the knowledge enough to know what you have memorized and what you must still note down. And the act of repeatedly writing down the hard parts commits those to memory too.By the end, the notecard has a handful of difficult to remember formulas and a bunch of keywords that prompt your memory to recall the salient details. In the US at that time, a single notecard was often allowed during exams, so the final work product was also that card.(My recall 20 years later is excellent, so this is not cramming.)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"1. attend every lecture without fail2. take legible notes by hand on everything that goes on the chalkboard3. do all the homework, and do it on time4. make sure you understand how to get the solution to every homework problem5. review notes and all homework problems as prep for the examI found this meant reliably getting at least a B in the courses at Caltech. Getting an A required considerably more work.My high school technique of not bothering to do much of anything and still getting an A took a year and a half of abject failure at Caltech before I wised up. Fortunately, Caltech&#39;s freshman year was pass/fail, evidently they were familiar with people like me :-)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"As a former middle school teacher, I found that the evidence-based techniques that the author mentioned, such as &#34;spacing&#34; and &#34;retrieval&#34;, were underutilized in classrooms due to teachers not knowing about them, as well as how tedious it can be to implement them. I founded a nonprofit called Podsie (https://www.podsie.org) to help with this problem, and we created a free tool that&#39;s essentially like &#34;Anki for classrooms&#34; so that teachers can help their students study more effectively in their classes."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Interesting notes:&gt; However, WhatsApp Ireland, which had previously set aside €77.5m for a possible fineRight there. The cost of violations is priced in. Companies actually misbehave and simply accept a potential fine as a business expense.&gt; The company is also understood to feel that the fine is out of step with previous GDPR related fines.It just sucks for our shareholders if the fine is higher than we expected.&gt; Sources close to the company, which is owned by Facebook, said rather than making its policy shorter and less complicated, the decision would mean it would have to add even more information to its already long and complicated privacy policy.The lies, incredible. Just don’t collect data, then your privacy statement is very very simple. Only complicated agreements require complicated 5,000 word privacy declarations."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"One important thing to note is that the DPC (Irish DPA) did not want to fine WhatsApp and only did so after being forced by other DPAs through the arbitration process.You can consult the EDPB decision on that matter here: https://edpb.europa.eu/our-work-tools/our-documents/binding-...EDIT: Max Schrems&#39; reaction (NOYB):&gt;&#34;We welcome the first decision by the Irish regulator. However, the DPC gets about ten thousand complaints per year since 2018 and this is the first major fine. The DPC also proposed an initial € 50 million fine and was forced by the other European data protection authorities to move towards € 225 million, which is still only 0.08% of the turnover of the Facebook Group. The GDPR foresees fines of up to 4% of the turnover. This shows how the DPC is still extremely dysfunctional.&#34;source: https://noyb.eu/en/statement-dpc-issues-eu-225-million-fine-..."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Regarding questions in the comments: Assuming allotments in .dk works roughly as in .se, they are designed not to be actual homes.You&#39;re not allowed to use them as your listed place of residence; authorities require you to have a &#34;real&#34; residence as well. This can of course be circumvented by claiming you live with a friend and listing yourself at their address, but it&#39;s illegal and measures will be taken accordingly if you&#39;re found out - you&#39;ll surely lose your allotment, if nothing else.Allotments are concentrated to specific areas, typically on municipal or county land rented by a co-op consisting of the inhabitants. Nowadays, most co-ops have installed municipal utilities (water, electricity) but not plumbing for human waste, which means most of them still have outhouses. Outhouse waste management is of course also heavily regulated. Often these utilities, at least water, are turned off during winter.The permanence of allotments is fleeting; many of them are continually moved or chopped off in order to make room for actual residential buildings. They are however very popular among apartment dwellers who move out to their cosy little allotment houses at the first sign of spring.Regarding the OP, nice work! Looks great."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Nice little house!
I did exactly the same, with the same costs, and lived there happily for several years during my studies at University. It was a great time and a good place for a single young man with a dog.I used a wood burning bath stove with a 100 liter copper tank to store heat for the night. It worked great. The 100 liter of water kept heat for many hours and the tank surface radiated it slowly into the room. This was much more convenient than a simple wood stove. I had only to add wood one time per day in autumn and two times per day in winter."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I am currently using the DIY version running Ubuntu.I absolutely love this laptop. It had been awhile since I built a computer (let alone a laptop). The DIY kit instructions and the construction of the machine itself are very well thought out.I am very excited for a future where we can measure the lifespan of our personal electronics in decades rather than months.Congrats to the Framework team!"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is the first time I&#39;m hearing about the Framework laptop and… damn, it looks enticing.Unfortunately, 13&#34; is definitely too small for me (in terms of ergonomics). Are you planning on releasing models with a larger (and matte) screen in the future?Also, could the keyboard &#34;module&#34; in theory be fully customized by the community (so as to support ergonomic layouts similar to ErgoDox, include a trackpoint etc.)?Finally, why only 4 expansion slots? AFAIU there&#39;s no Thunderbolt card(?) yet, so I need every USB slot I can get my hands on and 2 (4 - 1 HDMI or DP slot - 1 PowerDelivery slot) would definitely not be enough!"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I see the founder @nrp replying to a few comments here.@nrp, can you comment on upcoming models? Would love to have a 15&#34; or 17&#34; model with the same swappable ports but with a beefier processor and much larger memory capacities.The larger frames might allow for more ports, but I&#39;m not sure if you&#39;re limited by the number of PCIe lanes on these processors.I think a Ryzen offering would also be welcomed.Lastly thanks so much for this product and for first-class Linux support."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Lenovo left a sour taste for me after they pushed a BIOS update through Windows Update on my daughter&#39;s Flex that bricked the device (in the middle of a school-week, while she was doing online school).There were dozens of reports of the same problem from other owners of that model, yet they refused to acknowledge the issue was theirs or offer any self-serve option (I remember most laptops nowadays can re-flash the BIOS from an attached USB with specific format and layout, but I presume they saved a couple of cents by removing that feature from the Flex models). Luckily the laptop was still in warranty and I got it &#34;fixed&#34; after 6 weeks, but will never purchase another Lenovo product again."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Gentle reminder that Lenovo jumped the shark quite a while ago. The whole Superfish debacle, the spyware, the crapware, the endless stream of shitty decisions. Year after year, the hardware gets worse. Customer support gets worse.The sad thing is that they&#39;re still better than everything else out there. Which says a lot about the laptop industry in general."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I wonder if the ad bombardment we are suffering for some years now will eventually reach a critical point to trigger mass exodus or protests.TV got annoying with ads and viewership greatly decreased but that was caused by the emergence of the internet I think, what new technology options we have to escape the current ads to?
The only other hope is that the massive amount of money in ads and data collection is actually a bubble that will collapsebtw. Ben Krasnow is the guy behind Applied Science youtube channel[0], I highly recommend checking it out[0] https://www.youtube.com/c/AppliedScience"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I disdain the owners of both but Bezos (fairly) seems to get a bit more ire here. The Verge’s piece elaborated that SpaceX hasn’t decided between two configurations and want approval for both even though they will only choose one, so everyone else has to plan around two different configurations.I’m not sure if that’s standard procedure but it does seem a bit unfair to add double work for everyone else."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I recommend Schmidle’s recent book “Test Gods” if you are interested in Virgin Galactic and test piloting. Schmidle is not an engineer and I would have enjoyed a deeper dive into Virgin Galactic’s design choices, but it is a great book about (among other things) the tensions that emerge when a complex technical project is overseen from a distance by utterly nontechnical, PR-oriented upper management. The company’s communications and business strategies make a lot more sense knowing that the people calling the shots do not comprehend in the slightest how their product works.For many reasons (some alluded to in this article, many more in the book), SpaceShipTwo is an inherently risky experimental test craft—with death always waiting on each side of a narrow envelope—and it always will be. Management is willfully ignorant of this. Engineering leadership has done what they can to make the vehicle safer (at the cost of performance), but the intractable issue is that any one mistake by a pilot is likely to be fatal (and already has been, in the 2014 accident). Voices like Stucky and Ericson who wanted to acknowledge the inherent danger of the vehicle (which doesn’t mean grounding it) have been ignored and ultimately removed. The company’s business requires the vehicle to be understood to be safe by the public. The chickens will come home to roost."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Brilliant well written article. Not without bias, but you can see through the words on the page and into the immense pressure that team at Virgin Galactic must have been under to get their boss into space and to beat Bezos, all for the inflated ego of one man. Branson did put his life on the line to achieve that accolade though, which was a gutsy move."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; “ A private program can’t afford to lose anybody,” Branson said.Worth noting that Virgin Galactic is currently the only private space program to have killed anyone so far. This quote is from before the fatal 2014 crash, but the FAA makes it pretty clear that a virgin galactic had a cavalier attitude towards crew safety[0] back then too. Combined with this article, that paints a picture of Virgin Galactic as a genuinely unsafe company that is going to kill a lot of people if it’s not stopped. Manual processes, no safeties, high pilot work loads, and rockets do not mix well.0 - This was caused by a design that explicitly assumed that highly trained test pilots were incapable of making mistakes.  The design required manual activation, had no failsafes, and the pilots were not told that activation at too low a speed would cause the vehicle to break apart. A breathtakingly bad design for a spacecraft."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"&#34;FVP-02-014 General: Cross-site WebSocket hijacking (High)The provided staging build contains the Mozilla VPN WebSocket Controller, which exposes a WebSocket endpoint on localhost. No additional authentication is required to interact with this port, thus allowing any website to connect and interact with the VPN client. At the beginning of the audit, Mozilla assured that this WebSocket server is only part of the staging build. However, later it was revealed that Mozilla would like to reuse this connection for communication with a browser extension in the future. Thus, Cure53 decided to report this issue.&#34;A classic one.Also interesting:&#34;On Linux and macOS, a helper shell script is called by the privileged daemon which sets up WireGuard and network configurations. This script is extremely critical for security and should normally get most of the security attention. However, prior to the test, Mozilla has announced that it will be replaced soon and, as such, does not warrant substantial reviewing efforts. This - in Cure53’s opinion - is rather unfortunate in relation to its criticality.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"For me, Erlang was the ladder to functional programming. Once I’ve mastered Erlang to be able to write gossiperl (http://gossiperl.com, not maintained in a long time), all immutable programming became easy. Maps, flat maps, recursion, no side effects, all became clear.After Erlang, I’ve enjoyed Scala a lot. Especially Akka.I do tons of go now and when I need actors in go (not very often because channels are rather straightforward), I use proto.actor: https://github.com/AsynkronIT/protoactor-go.Erlang is awesome. I can definitely recommend the “Designing for scalability with Erlang/OTP”: https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/designing-for-scalabili.... This is the book which finally made me “get it”."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I gotta say I really enjoy these blogs. This and the Go one are really well done. Stylistically I love the look and the art is great too!Then the content is enjoyable, and the length of the posts seems just about right too.Where do I subscribe?Also, technically speaking, having shipped Erlang a few times in 3 different products (although all of them were between 2000 and 2010), that I&#39;ve had the least amount of trouble developing them the REPL experience is (was?) awesome with all the Emacs integration. The ability to basically shell into a remote node and poke around live was extremely handy.People didn&#39;t like the binary logging but it seems systemd forced it down their throats anyway later. Also, I provided really easy tools to read the logs using the runtime, so they didn&#39;t care much in the long run.It was really easy to write pipe drivers for programs written in Haskell, Python and C++. I even used the Java integration back then.OTP was like a dream come true, and when you&#39;re building out an SNMP MIB, MNesia made that so stupidly easy - I couldn&#39;t believe how much faster I was going than the folks trying to plug into NetSNMP.I wish I was still working on that project sometimes. It was my favorite."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I found this to be an accurate write up, though my experience has been Elixir, which inherits all of the traits of Erlang (to my knowledge), most notably the BEAM / OTP.Side note: That&#39;s a really cool graphic that looks to be Joe Armstrong, Robert Virding, Mike Williams with telephones? Where&#39;d that come from?"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I&#39;ve gotten into networking and very much enjoy seeing how others approach the problem space at the scale level! It&#39;s gotten more important with not just the explosion of online threats, smart home devices etc., but also just because there is more and more value to be extracted from a high bandwidth WAN link via your own private services. That said I definitely strongly recommend against using anything UniFi based for routing/gateway tasks at this point (author mentions their AIO custom hardware UDM thing). They have significant issues now in WiFi and even switching, but at least remain kind of workable there. But the company has been an absolutely depressing development dumpster fire for years now and the trajectory still appears aimed straight down. And for whatever reason routing/gateway in particular is an area that only ever briefly got much oxygen there. So for a greenfield situation I&#39;d be wary.There are lots of enormously better solutions for that. Personally I&#39;ve dumped all my UniFi gateways (including some of the &#34;next generation&#34; ones I had for testing) and moved to OPNsense running on decent SuperMicro 1U edge systems (excellent value, quiet, regularly available dirt cheap on ebay and the like). But there are many great options there including VyOS, OpenWRT, or even just running straight OpenBSD if that&#39;s what you like. Router/gateway is one area where I thinking devoting real metal, preferably with higher reliability hardware and extra remote management options (like IPMI), is worth it. It&#39;s an important linchpin for a typical network, and while virtualizing it is possible and definitely desirable at large scale it&#39;s not where I want to add more moving parts without a team behind it. Everything else can go tits up while I mess with it or there are odd interactions and as long as the gateway/routing is still solid odds are I can recover without much disruption or having to physically be there."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"For anyone who wants to go a similar route I can highly recommend OpenWrt as the OS. Not only does it run on cheap routers, but also on big x86 machines and even in VMs and/or containers. For example, I run OpenWrt on my desktop in a LXC container to manage networking (Wifi, bridging firewall for bridging VMs into the network, general firewall, etc.) through the nice webui. It gets direct to access the WiFi adapter and the host gets access through a bridge connected to the container via a VETH interface.It comes with nice addon packages for stuff like Wireguard, all kinds of tunnels/VPN, adblockers, runs containers and a ton more. I even run it on a VPS as container with it having exclusive access to the &#34;physical&#34; NIC. The parent OS isn&#39;t directly accessible at all. Makes firewalling a breeze. The only open ports are for the Tor relay and Wireguard, through Wich I connect to the webui/ssh and do everything else.Of course, my router also runs OpenWrt..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Really glad to see this write-up. I love my current PiHole setup, but replicating it for family/friends (especially with my blocking so many sites they might want) hasn&#39;t seemed doable. I would be having to help them constantly with blocked sites, etc.,.My setup could be even better if either Fios or Orbi provided a half-decent router, but just using PiHole as my DNS server has been awesome. When my Pi (SD card) crashed and I had to revert to my old router setup, it was shocking how slow everything was. I&#39;d become so used to pages loading in a blink, waiting a second or two while ads loaded seemed to take forever.If you have any unused SFF computer gathering dust, give PiHole a try (runs on any of the major linux distros). Initial setup takes under an hour. You can customize the backend out of it with blocksite lists; I&#39;m blocking so much my wife and kids can&#39;t even install new iPhone apps. Amazon Devices, Rokus, Google, nothing gets to call home unless I allow it. I have it forcing all Google/Bing searches to use their clean filter; worrying my kids might google &#34;porn&#34; is a thing of the past. There are easy to find tutorials out there, just be sure to filter Google images, as well."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&gt; People even discovered more of the Internet, such as things like &#34;file transfer protocol,&#34; where they could get lots of stuff no one had ever seen in the form of files. Programs such as &#34;finger&#34; let a person see who had been online, which, again, blew people&#39;s minds. People were so excited by the World Wide Web, they never wanted to go back to AOL or Compuserve or Prodigy.This person&#39;s explanation for why AOL died does not match up with my memories. I remember regularly using AOL&#39;s built in web browser (which was just a wrapper around IE) to surf the web. The reason my family switched away from AOL was because we could get faster internet through our cable company. It had nothing to do with FTP, fingering, or &#34;discovering the world wide web&#34;.&gt; The business people decided that there should be a way to make something like AOL, even though everyone thought Web sites were amazing and didn&#39;t want to go back.Again, this just doesn&#39;t line-up with how I remember things. I remember people liking the sense of community AOL had (the chats, IMs, forums, etc). It was other factors (faster internet, etc), that led to AOL&#39;s downfall."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"A lot of people I know have online lives that live within or around facebook and nothing else.They get their news from facebook as the news/media organisation posts updates to their feeds, which they can share with others via WhatsApp or messenger. No need to visit the news sites it&#39;s all there.They get their local second hand marketplace through Facebook Marketplace, no need for eBay et al.They get their local community updates, gossip, business recommendations etc. through Facebook Groups. No need for nextdoor or neighbourhoood specific websites/forums.They can find local businesses through the Facebook as the businesses have a Page that describes what they do, testimonials from previous customers, bit of a social feed to add some personality/&#39;blogging&#39;. Contactable through messenger. The businesses don&#39;t need to setup a website, Facebook offers all the tools.You never have to leave, especially on iOS/Android if you use the facebook app. Even links to external sites are rendered in a webview, so no need to look at URLs."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"It seems like I completely mis-remember things...IIRC, in addition to being an &#34;online portal&#34; to online content, it was also an ISP. Back in those days, most internet access was via a Dial-Up modem. If you wanted to get online, your computer had to make a phone call. Where we were, dialing outside of the region defined by our prefix (the 3 numbers after the area code) was considered a &#34;long distance call&#34; and was like 10 cents per minute or something. Connecting to the internet ran up your phone bill ~ fast! if you did not have a LOCAL ISP. IIRC (which is questionable), AOL had toll free numbers, but they&#39;d charge you for your time online - so your internet bill came from your ISP only and not from ISP + Phone Company. Part of AOL&#39;s marketing gimmick &#34;first 1,000 hours free!&#34; or some such amount of time to get you to sign up.This was nearly 30 years ago, and I didn&#39;t really understand how it all worked back then, and my parents paid the phone bills (not me!) so my recollection may be full of partial-truths or downright falsehoods. But point being - I think the article really understates AOL&#39;s role in being an ISP (especially for rural folks who didn&#39;t have local ISPs)."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"The Mac App Store gives a hint at what would happen if there was any choice.  The amount of software actually available for the Mac is far, far greater than what’s listed in the store.  Furthermore, while some quality and notable apps are still in the Mac App Store, many well-known apps are not there.  The number of lousy apps is also extremely high every time I go to search or just look at the front page, to the point where Apple does itself no favors by even drawing attention to most of the apps on that store (and it gives the impression that “most” Mac software must be like this).If they simply listed all major Mac apps, e.g. linking to their web sites or download links or whatever, they would hugely increase the value of the Mac platform and bring enough direct benefit to developers to be worth some kind of fee (and of course Apple gets $99/year anyway).  Instead, they tried to port the same clueless, greedy, review-burdened scheme to that store, layering completely unnecessary requirements on top (like poorly-thought-out sandboxing).  And since developers had a choice, they mostly said No."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I have a question about monopolies and market abuses.Apple released their phone in 2007, the App Store in 2008, and in-app payments in 2009. During that time their marketshare was fairly small, and it didn&#39;t start to really grow until they expanded availability to the Verizon network in 2011.Right at launch of the App Store, Apple announced its sales commission would be 30%. Then they extended that same fee to in-app purchases a year later. At the same time they set the rules that third-party app stores were not allowed, and that third-party payment processors could not be used.I&#39;m mentioning all of this history to make this point: Apple made these rules when they were not a monopoly by any definition. They released these products, with these rules, into a free market and let the market (both users and developers) decide which products to use and which products to develop for.Now, obviously, between 2007 and 2021 the iPhone has been a wild success. Its platform has grown in users and developers every year.So in terms of the framing of &#34;market abuse&#34;, at what point between the launch of these rules and now did Apple cross that threshold between free-market competitor who can legally control their own platform to monopolist abusing its power?I&#39;m asking this question not just to make a point, but because I think it will be instructive for future companies to understand where in the growth curve the rules they started with can potentially cross over into being &#34;abusive&#34;."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"There is a German movie about the system that is used to gather TV ratings. It&#39;s a special box that some users get which reports what they are watching. Small sample size goes into a big statistic (not sure how accurate the portrayal of the system in the movie is). These boxes are given to the people who pay the German public TV fee, which excludes i.e. students (they don&#39;t have to pay) and some other groups. This group of critical people figured that out and started to hack into these machines to fake ratings. They faked the ratings away from stupid trash TV towards some higher quality stuff, documentaries, culture, ...
Obviously in the movie then the country saw a renaissance, everyone got smarter, yadda yadda, you get it.I feel like this is similar.
All tech savvy people block ads and analytics and at least the known tricks they use against us. So the internet only tracks the defenseless people and is then built to serve them (and or exploit them).Maybe we should engage in large scale AdWords fraud. Send come fake traffic away from Facebook and over to Wikipedia."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I expected these numbers to be higher. However, an even more interesting metric is the 88% block in Firefox.Firefox may not have a great market share, but based on these numbers it&#39;s market share may very well be eight times higher than your analytics report. This can change the argument of &#34;it&#39;s only 3% of our users so we don&#39;t need to test on FF&#34; to &#34;it&#39;s a quarter of our user base, we should at least test it&#34;, depending on your target audience. I&#39;ve seen tons of people claim general Firefox usage is negligible based on public data from websites such as statcounter, but these metrics prove that those statistics are unreliable and should not be used.The best you can do is use server side UA inspection, though you can&#39;t really distinguish bots from real users that way."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I am amazed at how non-techy people use the internet. I teach college and I will sometimes have students go to some web site. I am amazed at how few use adblocking and just accept all the ads and popups and overlays and crap. Even more than that, I will see them using something like google docs and google will put an overlay for some new feature and they don&#39;t click the X to close it. They just type away with that overlay in the corner. That drives me crazy. I don&#39;t know how they do it."</p>

We have a team of 50+ engineers that all use Docker for Mac for daily development tasks, but I suspect that will no longer be true in a rather short amount of time. Frankly, I don’t really know if anybody actually uses the UI components for it outside of starting and stopping the engine and for basic configuration of the VM. Everything else that comes with it is just useless cruft for our use cases.As soon as there is a viable alternative (and I’d be happy to contribute to the effort), I’ll be moving away from Docker for Mac."</p>

The &#39;without a judge&#39; part is strongly misleading:  (5)  If subsection (4) applies, the applicant must:
  
  (a)  provide as much information as the eligible Judge or nominated AAT member considers is reasonably practicable in the circumstances; and

  (b)  not later than 72 hours after the making of the application, send a duly sworn affidavit to the eligible Judge or nominated AAT member, whether or not a warrant has been issued.

Subsection (4) is about immediate threats.The AAT&#39;s decisions &#34;are subject to review by the Federal Court of Australia and the Federal Circuit Court of Australia&#34; (Wikipedia).https://parlinfo.aph.gov.au/parlInfo/search/display/display....This is just the digital equivalent of a police officer being able to arrest you without a court order."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;m most curious about what they mean by &#34;ADDING&#34; data...Does this mean the police can create a social media account in your name? Imagine for instance that they suspect one of your family members of tax evasion. Can they create a fake social media account or email account registered to you, and impersonate you for the sake of entrapping someone else? Like hey uncle, love your new car, got any hot accounting tips? I don&#39;t even see anything in these laws that says the person whose data they&#39;re accessing has to be the target of the investigation.Imagine if at any time in any chat, even with your partner or parent or child, you couldn&#39;t know whether you were actually talking with them or a government agent, perhaps because someone they know is tangentially suspected of a crime - without the matter even being brought before a judge. Terrifying. This is how societies turn into places where everyone is completely fearful of saying anything at all."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I have a System76 Serval WS with AMD Ryzen 9 3900 and Nvidia GTX 1660 Ti manufactured last year. The laptop&#39;s internal display went wonky late last week but an external display still works fine. It&#39;s annoying to reboot -- the GPU drivers aren&#39;t loaded yet when the boot disk passphrase prompt is shown, so the external display doesn&#39;t show the passphrase prompt (and importantly: whether unlocking succeeded). It&#39;s within a 1-year warranty for parts &amp; labor. I&#39;m currently talking to with System76 support staff to ship it back for repair. The process has, so far, been easy and straightforward.In the past they had pushed a driver update that disabled the laptop display when multiple monitors are connected. I had recognized the problem since their system drivers are open source and was able to recommend &amp; review a PR to fix [0]. It was nice to see that patch go in.[0]: https://github.com/pop-os/system76-driver/pull/182"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Mildly related: I&#39;m curious what are the latest advances in consumer irons and ironing boards. Something that improved them in the last 10-15 years, even incrementally.For example SSDs became much more common and affordable over the past 15 years and their parameters also improved. Are there similar improvements in household appliances like irons? Where would one look for an industry overview?"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Interesting, but something about this article is weird. Overall it doesn&#39;t feel like it&#39;s in the Wikipedia style and some parts are very editorialized, e.g.&gt; As extreme ironing has branched off, the conditions can gain in extreme activity. For example, a branch of ironing has been developed that includes both bungee jumping and well-pressed clothing. Bungee ironing is what some would call the ultimate in the thrill of extreme ironing.[8]That citation leads to https://averyj12.weebly.com/extreme-ironing.html, which was clearly copied wholesale from Wikipedia (all its links and citations go directly back to Wikipedia).Looking at the history, there have been a lot of edits since that text was added in 2007, so it&#39;s surprising that someone hasn&#39;t rewritten it since then."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"There&#39;s a long case history in front on the NRLB about whether or not employees can use employer&#39;s resource (ie notice boards, email system, slack) for organizing. In general the rule has been that if employees can use something for general non-work purposes (e.g. setting up a baseball game on the weekend) then the company can&#39;t stop them from  using it for organizing.However the specifics (e.g. what if there is a policy about what topics are OK, but some OK topics are non-work, or what if there is a general work-only policy that is selectively enforced against organizing) have gone back and forth depending on the administration.Apple&#39;s behaviour is probably a result of a 2019 ruling [1] which opend the door to this kind of thing. Given that the administration has swung back to being fairly labor friendly, it&#39;ll be interesting if this gets to the NRLB to see if they find a way to make this illegal.[1] https://news.bloomberglaw.com/daily-labor-report/labor-board..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I really think employer hosted employee activism is just ... always a problem.It&#39;s a minefield, and one with slack where the employer has all that data, what was said, and who... that&#39;s just a mess for EVERYONE.&gt;But that rule has not been evenly enforced. Currently, Apple employees have popular Slack channels to discuss #fun-dogs (more than 5,000 members), #gaming (more than 3,000 members), and #dad-jokes (more than 2,000 members).I would find those more acceptable if I were an employer, even an employee.Edit:  I had a bad typo in this post where I said &#34;employee hosted&#34; and intended it to say &#34;employer&#34; now fixed, thus some of the responses."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt;&gt;Slack channels for activities and hobbies not recognized as Apple Employee clubs or Diversity Network Associations (DNAs) aren’t permitted and shouldn’t be created.Clearly the solution is to have an &#34;LGBTQ+ and pay equality&#34; channel./s if it isn&#39;t obvious."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"In many ways I think this blog post really makes quite compelling arguments and honestly opened my eyes a bit.One (perhaps mad) idea for more secure access to a machine deep behind many levels of NAT where you, the sysadmin, have lawful access but are fed up with having to have a 12 KB ~/.ssh/config file in order to access it because of your university&#39;s overbearing IT department^W^W^W^W network topology, would be to &#34;just&#34; run an onionsite with onion services authentication [1], preventing it being publicly accessed without the pre-shared key. If your onion service just redirects to ssh (presumably with certificate-only auth) I can&#39;t help but think that this is almost an example of security by obscurity done right.[1] https://support.torproject.org/en-US/onionservices/client-au..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I recently had to do some basic sysadmin stuff over tor and I disagree with OP.Two things that failed mieserably, fetching a file that was just shy of 5M, and a reverse SSH tunnel.The SSH tunnel was unusable, it would only last for minutes at the most. I wish I could use mosh but that requires UDP.The file transfer was actually done with curl and the file was often incomplete.This was all done within Europe where we have the highest concentration of tor nodes.So no, I don&#39;t think tor is appropriate for sysadmin tasks."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Several years ago I used a Tor Hidden Service in a professional capacity to expose an application from a Wireless network with properties that we wouldn&#39;t know ahead of time.Worked like a charm, and no regrets.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Most of the dissonance comes from the fact that a job is much more than the core activity.When we speak of pottery as a hobby, we think of handling clay, sitting in front of a pottery wheel, choosing a fitting glaze, then admiring our finished work. The focus is on exploring and enjoying the process. You have complete control over the process and you can do as much or as little as you like because there is no delivery pressure. Sounds fun!But a pottery business is a different beast. Now, the act of making the pottery is a much smaller part of the overall workload. You have to deal with marketing, sales, payments, inventory, and communications. Your pottery time is no longer about exploring, but about replenishing inventory or handling custom orders in time to avoid bad reviews. You can&#39;t just make a piece and be done with it, you have to carefully pack it, handling shipping, drop it off, and hope that nothing goes wrong. If it does go wrong, you now have to deal with the fallout and handle angry customers. Most customers are fine, but it only takes 1 irrationally outraged customer to ruin your day.Hobbies, by definition, can&#39;t be a job. You can try to make a job or business that includes your hobby, but it&#39;s a superset of the hobby with numerous other activities that you may or may not enjoy.I do actually know a lot of people who enjoy running businesses. You might say that businesses are their hobby and delivering results to customers is their passion. Not surprisingly, they&#39;re doing quite well in both business and the mental health department. Lucky."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The first half of the article resonates with me. I didn&#39;t use to have hobbies and I used to feel like a machine just going to work, coming back, sleep, rinse and repeat. I love programming but after writing nth CRUD app in flavor of the month framework / technology, it just isn&#39;t that fulfilling anymore. I picked up couple of hobbies - teaching Sanskrit and playing guitar and my life has improved drastically. I no longer derive meaning only from work. Both hobbies are just hobbies and I do it for fun only with no intention of monetizing them. In fact, I couldn&#39;t monetize them even if I wanted to. Sanskrit is too esoteric to have any commercial value of any kind. And I truly suck at guitar. Nobody&#39;s ever gonna pay me to play guitar. But whatever I can play, gives me pleasure, so I do it. My dad asks me why I waste so much time in useless hobbies when I could be investing that time working towards next promotion and pay raise. I reply to him, they are not useless if they make me happy and content."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&#34;Doing what you love&#34; is a total new-age garbage scam, only possible because we (most of us on HN) collectively live in the wealthiest, most powerful empire the world has ever seen, and nearly all of the important work (food, defense, fuel, manufacturing, etc.) is done by lower class citizens who don&#39;t know what an API is. Sure, the management of the empire requires critically talented minds, but how many roughnecks know what C++ is, and how many executive vice presidents know how to operate an oil rig?Don&#39;t do what you love, do something that allows you and your family (or you and your community if you&#39;re not up to the task of having a family) to build resilience, and then love your life outside of the work you do to provide for it. If that&#39;s making 200 Gs per year for 10 years slinging Javascript and then getting out of debt with the bank, do that. Don&#39;t worry so much about &#34;loving your career&#34;, I promise you no migrant farm workers harvesting your berries love their career, and yet I doubt they wake up with internal mental crises because they haven&#39;t achieved self-actualization at work."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"As I get older, the less I identify as my current state and the more I identify with the person who transitions through states. My change in perspective has reduced my anxieties and anger significantly. &#34;This too shall pass&#34; and all that. The more of my self image is focused on superficial things, the more I will take things personally. What we are angry about tends to be a reflection of ourselves more than the current state of affairs.If I see myself as a busy professional I might be much more aggravated by someone at the grocery store holding up the checkout line with EBT (since I am busy they must be lazy!). If I see myself as a social climber I will always be worrying if people are using me for something (since I am using them!). If I identify with my wealth I might develop some neurosis regarding the sight of the homeless (since they represent ultimate failure!).I don&#39;t believe in reincarnation but it is a helpful thought experiment to think about what benefits and drawbacks your particular incarnation of life holds and how those might be different if you were incarnated elsewhere."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I don’t know if this is a mental hack or not, but I found years ago that if I mentally sing the comments (that I know would upset me otherwise), it totally removes the emotional impact of other people’s negative writing.When I was contemplating why this might be so effective, I was reminded that satire of old often involved singing to point out other peoples absurdity. When you think about how much the powerful fear humor and satire, there might be something there…"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Nothing trains you to not take things personally like being put through the ringer of modern day online dating. Forcing myself to deal with rejection hasn&#39;t been a very pleasant experience, but I&#39;m absolutely sure I&#39;ve improved because of it. As soon as you can truly and honestly accept that in the vast majority of cases, you do not have the power to change people&#39;s perception or attraction to you, it&#39;s not only liberating: you also realize that effort is better placed where you have a decent chance of actually changing the outcome.Once you understand and feel confident in what you have to offer other people, if they do not want it, what else is there to say? Nobody wants everything, and nobody can offer everything. A single human, or ten humans, is not representative of humanity. There&#39;s nothing to be sad about, it&#39;s just an interaction among millions, and you just need to find new interactions.It&#39;s based in insecurity, the need to affirm our value through other people. This is of course fundamentally human and is practically impossible to get rid of, but you don&#39;t have to assign the same value to every single human you come across in your life. You don&#39;t like every human being in the world, so why would you expect every human being to like you?"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I have mixed feelings about this.Younger me learned a lot of problem solving skills and most importantly spent a lot of time learning how to read by playing RPGs and games that required lots of reading. My reading skills would not have been as advanced if i wasn&#39;t playing text heavy games that had a lot of plot like Square Enix games and the CRPGs of the time.Modern games though are clearly designed to get you as addicted as possible and to play as long as possible to an extent that made the old school 90s RPGs grinds look tame and mild. (the grinds in those games basically existing to make sure you had to play long enough to not be able to return it to the store or beat it via rental)Modern UX of games is designed so that you dont have to really read or understand the game mechanics even to be able to play and get into that feedback loop. To the point where when a game comes along like Dark Souls that asks you to learn the game systems to beat it, gamers go gah gah over &#34;how hard&#34; it is."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"People talking about the benefits of games reminds me of people talking about the benefits of, say, a glass of wine with every meal: it&#39;s worth looking into but at the same time it&#39;s the sort of thing that obviously doesn&#39;t scale linearly with the amount/intensity of consumption.I similarly have mixed feelings as well, but for slightly different reasons. I&#39;ve read about studies that say that musical training (which is often believed to translate to improvements in other cognitive aspects of life) doesn&#39;t actually correlate to said improvements, and I suspect that the same might be true for games (e.g. solving game puzzles doesn&#39;t necessarily mean you get better at school math or whatever)This line of reasoning is also supported by research on correlation between games and violence (i.e. the consensus is that no such causation relationship exists).All of these suggest (to me) that gaming is just its own activity without much impact on life other than opportunity cost itself.However, there are some aspects of gaming that can affect overall well-being, specifically aspects related to repetitiveness (e.g. grinding). Repetitiveness is something that does come up in a lot of disciplines (e.g. its soothing effect in autist kids, or repetitiveness as tool in the context of meditation, etc).The &#34;addictive&#34; aspect isn&#39;t necessarily a bad thing either, IMHO. Games are, almost by definition, supposed to be engaging. But that addictiveness may come in a form of trade-offs, for example, back in the day of grindy RPGs, delayed gratification was basically the entire point of grinding. The one aspect that I think is justly vilified is monetization strategies that tie to addictive elements of gameplay (especially the gacha variety) and this is something that I&#39;d actually commend China for trying to address via regulation."</p>

It&#39;s a PHP 7.3 codebase with sure quite a lot of legacy stuff but a lot of thing has been improved and refactored with the time. It&#39;s maintained, there is an active community and an healthy enterprise behind the project. IHMO  this is that matters more than the programming language used.* SabreDAV supports WebDAV and this is that we are using at Nextcloud for our webdav/caldav and carddav support.* KOrganizer does run on Windows but it require to be built from source. I have been told that a better Windows support is being worked on for the entire PIM suite and I hope that at some point exe can be distributed. Technically there is nothing that makes it impossible to use on macOS, we just need more helping hands to help with fixing the platform specific issues. There is also a modern alternative to Korganizer being worked on called Kalendar. More on it can be learned on https://claudiocambra.com/ (Disclaimer: I was the mentor of this GSoC project)."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Surprised nobody has mentioned this yet, but Org-mode for Emacs [1] is just great, and fits very well to the requirements:- Source of truth: these are text files, so any of git, nextcloud, syncthing etc. will do.- Consistent interface: using emacs might be tough on mobile, but there are some pretty good web interfaces for it [2].

(…) MarkMonitor is not a cheap solution to this problem, but it is widely used (apparently by &#34;more than half of the Fortune 100&#34;, per the page)“And then:“ MarkMonitor does not have a way of disclosing security issues, which inhibited reporting this to them in a timely manner. They have not responded to any of our communications.”Should anyone be surprised that a company that claims to not make mistakes, but has no way to report vulnerabilities gets their vulnerability on the front page of HN? (And this is a good case scenario, as opposed to their customers being hacked: which could have happened by an attacker claiming some of these domains)Let’s hope they make at least the change of putting a bug bounty program in place."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; This issue is not entirely the fault of MarkMonitor. While they need to be careful with handling parked domains, AWS is at fault for not being more stringent with claiming S3 buckets. Google Cloud, for example, has required domain verification for years, rendering this useless.This sounds like more of an Amazon problem than a MarkMonitor problem to me. And it makes a good case for using other cloud providers over AWS, as with GCP this attack wouldn&#39;t have been possible. Merely creating the DNS records pointing to the cloud provider&#39;s nameservers shouldn&#39;t be enough for anyone to then claim it and start hosting."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Classical music is one of the hardest genres to surface through existing music apps.Where an app may have an &#34;artist&#34; field, classical music will have &#34;composer&#34; and then for the performers it will have &#34;orchestra&#34;, &#34;conductor&#34;, &#34;principal soloists&#34;. For an opera all of those are primary fields that could be considered &#34;artist&#34;.The variations of the data is huge, only last week I had to correct Tchaikovsky in my own data and looking at the variations I see online:    P. I. Tchaïkovski
    Peter Ilyitch Tchaikofsky
    Peter Tchaikovsky
    Petr Ilitch Tchaïkovski
    Piotr Ilic Tchaikovskij
    Piotr Ilyitch Tchaikovski
    Piotr Tchaikovski
    Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky (this one is arguably most correct)

This is something everyone gets wrong, and yet whomever gets it right is going to help make it easier for people to find and celebrate classical music, and to expose more people to classical music.Even if today you know that you love Beethoven&#39;s Symphony No 3... finding the best performance and recording is almost impossible, and if you do happen to stumble upon it on a streaming service getting back to it later (if it wasn&#39;t the only one in your recents) is difficult.I&#39;m really glad someone is investing in this, and it needs to be a different app / interface to handle this difference in metadata and in weighting of the fields. Capturing the intent of &#34;oh, this person really just wants to search Gould as a principal soloist and weight the search that way&#34; is far easier when you have an app that can provide a classical music perspective and filter over an existing library.PS: Plex does this really badly too... whatever you do, don&#39;t let the Plex Music Agents decide the metadata, Verdi disappeared and had the metadata for Veridia which I believe is a rock band."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; Primephonic is no longer available for new subscribers and will be taken offline beginning September 7. Apple Music plans to launch a dedicated classical music app next year combining Primephonic’s classical user interface that fans have grown to love with more added features. In the meantime, current Primephonic subscribers will receive six months of Apple Music for free, providing access to hundreds of thousands of classical albums, all in Lossless and high-resolution audio, as well as hundreds of classical albums in Apple Music’s Spatial Audio, with new albums added regularly.This is utter insanity. I understand acquiring, and &#34;sunsetting&#34; the acquisition when it makes sense, blocking new user signups, and heck I&#39;d even say its pretty cool that they&#39;re planning on releasing a totally separate experience for Apple Music classical listeners.But why shut down Primephonic before this new experience is ready? It just pisses off the already niche and hesitant customer-base you&#39;ve announced you&#39;re trying to court!"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The most interesting thing about this is that Apple&#39;s pre-announcing that they&#39;re going to be launching a dedicated classical music app. Presumably it&#39;ll be very closely based on the current Primephonic app, and worked on by the same developers.This has some close parallels to Apple buying Workflow and turning it into their now-platform-standard Shortcuts app. It&#39;s still being worked on by the original developers, too.Shortcuts has been given fairly high priority in all Apple&#39;s recent OS releases, particularly as it ties into their home automation ecosystem, and it&#39;s resulted in surprising bursts of popularity. E.g. last years &#34;#aesthetic&#34; complete-homescreen-customization boom was entirely based on using Shortcuts as a hack to customize app icons.It&#39;s been honestly weird to see such a relatively high profile part of the OS being run as a mostly-independent subsidiary like that, particularly given Apple&#39;s notorious control-freak ways. Them expanding the approach like this rather than just cramming it into Music suggests that they think it&#39;s working well for them..."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The post title was a tad misleading - I got the impression that it was saying that Godot isn&#39;t ready and we shouldn&#39;t wait for it to become ready. I suppose it got my attention by being like that, and that was the point. Maybe it&#39;d&#39;ve been better as &#34;Stop Waiting for Godot - Game Jam&#34;.Happy to see Terry Cavanagh is trying Godot. I love Super Hexagon and VVVVVV, and am planning to play Dicey Dungeons in the future. Looking forward to see what he makes."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I have a friend who&#39;s been trying to go all-in on Godot but decided recently to switch over to something else, largely due to ongoing issues with its lighting system. When toying with it, he encountered poor lighting overall and some particularly counterintuitive behavior with the (rather simplistic) lighting system.For example, a simple scene with a wall intersecting the floor and a light placed on one side. In this scenario, you get weird light spilling around the edge onto the vertex where the wall meets the ground (see [0] and [1]).  There&#39;s also poor handling of multiple light sources; if you cast a shadow and place a light directly on top of the shadow area, it&#39;s impossible to displace the shadow (see [2]). These sorts of things are very noticeable, and part of the recent work that they&#39;ve just released was supposed to address this. However, these examples came from the most recent release, which made my friend begin considering other options with more robust lighting.[0] https://imgur.com/rsxjV5u

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;ve recently checked out Godot and it turned out to be easier than I expected. I followed this series of tutorials [0] (I found it most palatable at 2x speed, occasionally going to 1x for critical parts).Took me about an hour altogether to get pretty productive at making a non-trivial game. The engine is cool and takes care of a lot of routine things, like physics, collisions, and organizing things hierarchically.[0] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HvPTSZl2WCc"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I think a lot of this is because our profession does not have an accepted universal bar everyone can jump over to be considered ‘qualified’.  Every technical interview feels like rolling the dice in proving I am a competent developer.  Giving me 50 minutes in a high pressure situation in an environment i am unfamiliar with and people I just meet will never product my best results, and then add to the fact that I could be asked any question, and my ability to answer is it being ranked against other candidates.  Maybe someone else _just_ did a similar question in another interview and it’s fresh on his mind.  Maybe someone spend their entire career focusing on just this type of problem given in the interview, but the question in the interview is only partly related to the actual job."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"We made the interview process very simple and traditional in our current organisation. 30 minute chat, judge whether the person can do the job or is a good fit, if yes then offer a year contract with 1-3 months of evaluation period. Changing a job is risky also from the candidate&#39;s perspective so if the person is pretending, the lies will catch up. Most of the scenario it has worked pretty well.Sometimes, people who you think are not capable to do the job, often outperform expectations too. It is all about taking a risk on a person and giving them respect and a chance. We could have done leetcode, or pair programming session. It takes more energy and effort to do it from both sides and probability of finding a good candidate is more or less the same."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Very few firms want to hire juniors, while nearly all firms desire senior-level talent.This manifests inflated job vacancies because so many firms have an evergreen job posting for &#34;Senior Full Stack&#34;.  Because talent is scarce these roles rarely get filled (hiring managers expect million-dollar candidates to accept $100-200k compensation).Also, because lots of software requires specific expertise, there are vacancies that can&#39;t be filled because of a knowledge gap (novel industries / projects, etc).  For example, how could SpaceX possibly fill all their engineering roles?  Surely money is not a limiting factor, but rather the limited supply of qualified expert rocket engineers?"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Full title too long for HN &#34;French Appeal Court affirms decision that copyright claims on GPL are invalid; must be enforced via contractual dispute&#34;There was a brief HN discussion on the initial ruling 2 years ago https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=24478769 the case just went to appeal earlier this year.Note that the last HN discussion never really happened, it gathered both too many votes and flags in 20 minutes and got automatically hidden, only to be unblocked by a mod later. It would be great if you could refrain from flagging this time, even if the ruling comes as a culture shock to you.I assure you it is not clickbait. The authors of GPL software are really spending years and a fortune in court only to have all their copyright claims dismissed. The ruling passed the High Court (TGI), the Appeal Court and the CJUE."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"What I think is the real meat of the story:&gt; That is to conclude, by having a contract (a license is a contract), you lose your rights to pursue any IP/copyright claims (the two are exclusive in French law).GPL was written by lawyers for the American system of law and France is not part of the USA. The systems of law are different and therefore the implications of GPL-licensing code are different.I&#39;d be very surprised if France is the only country that treats software licenses like this. The basis of the USA system of law is completely different from even other European courts, let alone non-Western systems of law. Assuming you can write a license for use in the USA and enforce it the world around is quite foolish."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&gt; The Rust or Haskell compilers, for example, insist on policing whatever private understanding you might have about the meaning of your code.The thing about &#34;private understandings&#34; is that they&#39;re just another way of saying &#34;we expect ceaseless, flawless vigilance&#34; (as one writer put it), not to mention &#34;flawless communication and training.&#34;Languages which impose weird restrictions tend to do so because it allows them to offer (nearly) ironclad guarantees about something else.There are certain programming idioms that work brilliantly in Haskell. Those same idioms would be utterly miserable in the presence of unrestricted mutation.Or to take the author&#39;s other example, Rust forbids shared mutable state, and it keeps careful track of ownership. But I can freely use native CPU threads without worrying about anything worse than a deadlock, and I can bang directly on raw bytes without worrying about anything worse than a controlled runtime failure. And this remains true even if team communication occasionally fails or if someone makes a mistake.Sometimes I want to rule out entire classes of potentially dangerous mistakes, and not just have a &#34;private understanding&#34; that nobody will ever make certain mistakes.As always, it&#39;s a matter of using the right tool for the job. If you need to write a high-performance, heavily-threaded network server that parses malicious binary data, Rust is a great tool because of those restrictions. If you need to do highly exploratory programming and invent new idioms to talk about your problem domain, Common Lisp is awesome. And if you need to build libraries where everything has a rigid mathematical structure, Haskell is a great tool.In my experience, Commony Lisp is a deeply opinionated language, and its most dramatic opinion is that &#34;your code and your data should have identical representations and structures.&#34; And for the right problem, that restriction is extremely powerful."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"When I was younger I used to write a lot of Common Lisp. A lot. And I also had this idea that Haskell/OCaml/Scheme were strict, ivory tower totalitarian languages, while Common Lisp was this incredibly powerful, expressive, liberating tool. For building organisms, not pyramids, like Sussman said. And the S-expressions were aesthetically appealing to me. But at the time I was working mostly on smaller commercial projects and solo open source projects.Maybe it&#39;s cognitive decline from no longer being a teenager, or the experience of working on larger, O(100,000) line codebases with large teams, but nowadays I find a high degree of dynamism just exhausting. I don&#39;t want more expressive power, I want fewer nightmares.A common problem I faced with Common Lisp is I&#39;d write some module, then go on to write another module that depended upon the previous one, and get an exception through from the first module. Usually a type error. And I&#39;d have to go back, context-switch, fix that, and climb back up to the other level.With ML/OCaml/Haskell that is far less common. Being able to look at a module and say, &#34;this is done and it&#39;s correct&#34;, is a very powerful thing. Confidence, rather than safety, is the primary benefit of static typing for me.And I find that I no longer use the REPL. I&#39;ve been working on a compiler in OCaml and for some reason Dune won&#39;t run utop (lol) so I&#39;ve just not been REPL&#39;ing and it&#39;s not been a problem. The code typechecks. Things work on the first run. If I change something, I get notified what needs updating.The problem with interactive development is that it&#39;s like unit testing: it can prove the presence of bugs but not their absence. Type systems can eliminate large classes of bugs ahead of time.Just so this is not entirely negative or depressing: there&#39;s something beautiful about how maximalist Common Lisp is. It&#39;s a big, messy language with every programming paradigm (and you can invent new ones) and different naming conventions in the core language itself. I was learning new things about Common Lisp years into using it productively. And I compared the experience to moving to a huge stately home, that has a room for the piano, a vast attic, a wine cellar, all manner of things, and then trying to move back to a shoebox apartment. Where do I fit the piano? CLOS, the MOP, the Lovecraftian beauty of LOOP and FORMAT: it&#39;s like a wild garden next to the (comparative) spartan minimalism of practically everything else. And it&#39;s beautiful."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; These &#34;big idea languages&#34; tend to assert a kind of &#34;programming ideology&#34; over reality, and tend to, in my opinion, distance you from the thing you are trying to do, often, they claim, &#34;for your own good&#34; ... &#34;You want to give HOW many objects a mutable reference to this value?&#34; complains the Rust compiler. &#34;Are you insane? You are a Rustacean, you don&#39;t do that kind of thing!&#34;I agree with the spirit of this line of thought: in general I favor pragmatism over zealotry, and I think it should be up to the programmer to determine how a tool should be used, not the tool itself.However when we talk about something like the safety constraints imposed by Rust, it&#39;s more about citizenship than it is about the compiler being overly opinionated.  By baking those constraints into the language, I can have confidence when I use third party code that it reaches at least some standard in terms of memory safety and thread safety.  Much in the same way as a strict type system, those constraints free me up to not have to think about certain types of issues.If I am writing code which only I will consume, I&#39;m also free to use escape hatches to sidestep these constraints when I know they&#39;re not relevant.I&#39;ve written tens of thousands of lines of Rust by now, and I&#39;m still not convinced the Rust model is the right one in terms of achieving its goals, but I think the approach is &#34;reality based&#34; with respect to avoiding some of the problems which can occur while developing software in collaboration with others."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"After spending years in manufacturing IT, there are hundreds if not thousands of systems like these running, where the company that created the software is long gone.This where you end up with DOS, Windows 3.1 and even Windows NT computers controlling machines that make millions of dollars worth of product, 24 hours a day.We&#39;ve spent hours scouring eBay or industrial auction sites finding parts of computers to keep &#39;just in case&#39;. None of this software virtualizes easily or can even be moved to a machine of similar vintage without relicensing. Some of it is hardware dongles, some of it software keys.It seems like you could create quite a business being able to crack this software. Companies would pay tens of thousands to get these machines running. Often times the &#39;new&#39; version of the hardware and software is $100,000 US.In a few years, internet-based licensing will be the thing to crack."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Microsoft used to release a &#34;checked&#34; build for each version of Windows on MSDN/Visual Studio Subscription downloads. [1] This was a build with the same compiler optimization settings as the release build, but with debug-build-only assertions and checks included. In the checked build kernel, the system uptime had 49 days artificially added to it [2], precisely to help developers find out problems like this.At one point when I was on the Windows team at Microsoft, there was an internal push for us to selfhost (dogfood) checked builds of Windows, since they theoretically provided better bug telemetry than &#34;free&#34; builds (release builds, which are free of debug-only code). &#34;Slows your dev box down by just half!&#34; was the basic pitch of that campaign in a nutshell.[1] I don&#39;t know if this was ever done for Windows 95. It was done for Windows XP up to Windows 10 version 1511, but it appears to have stopped since then, at least according to my quick search.[2] https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/win32/api/sysinfoapi/nf-s..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"EPILOGUEHere&#39;s the exact point of the crash (cued to 5 seconds prior): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdrRoSdBM5M&amp;t=9778sThe counter overflows/resets, everything wraps around, the system counts 6 more seconds, then Windows 95 freezes.The mouse cursor still seems to work, but the message pump seems to have frozen, to the extent that End Task itself is unresponsive, and a second CTRL-ALT-DEL is needed to reset the machine.---This whole thing started back in July, over here (warning: megathread): https://twitter.com/Foone/status/1413694652822163459"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Having used Windows 95 back in the day, I am deeply impressed someone managed to keep it from crashing for so long.I have seen a Windows NT 4.0 system with an uptime of more than five years, but with Windows 95, even a whole day of uptime was pretty close to a miracle."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I’ve been watching this project for a long time and personally am very excited. The fact that it’s #1 on HN today (congrats!) makes me think I’m not the only one.There are also a lot of valid concerns in these comments about privacy and use of algorithms. A lot of it depends on what you’re looking to gain by adopting a new service/switching away from something else and individual concern.Personally, I’m looking for a place to store personal photos: friends, family, travel etc. Critical needs
- easy sharing ideally not locked into Apple’s ecosystem
- not to have my photos mined for advertising and social graph data (most important)
- ideally around for the long haul but in my mind this is for sharing, not backupI’m not particularly concerned about warrants, government surveillance etc. Again for me this is about sharing so the expectation of true privacy is low. Any photos I considered sensitive I would store elsewhere.For me, the biggest point of confidence I have in this project is that they charge money from day 1 and don’t have a forever free plan. I’m excited about projects that offer the benefits of “social” but where the software, not my data, is the product."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The monthly storage costs are too high. For the price of 1TB from you (15€), I can buy more than 2 TB just about anywhere else.Commercially, Apple and Google are both 2TB for 10 CHF and Amazon gives you unlimited as part of a Prime membership. Storage providers like Backblaze and Wasabi both charge around $5/TB and that&#39;s really the table-stakes price. For the more DIY-inclined, Hetzner sells a 2TB OwnCloud instance for 9.90€/month.I&#39;d prefer to buy software from you than storage. It&#39;s out of the question for me to pay you per TB but I&#39;d consider paying a flat rate for software I then host myself."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I’d love for something like this to exist (a fast, clean, well-designed mobile and desktop app for backing up my photos with E2E), but I’d only switch from one of the big providers if it were FOSS and I can bring my own backend target (e.g. S3, SMB, FTP).In a perfect scenario I could generate my own private key to plug into my client devices and just have everything push to private S3 (and then from there  archive to the cheapest, coldest glacier tier after it’s been synced to my home storage).This to me would not be that complicated to build, but would essentially provide E2E Photostream and a backup of last resort in the cloud.Obviously (as is the problem with all FOSS) you have the dilemma of how do the developers get paid, which I’m sure is why you went down this yet-another-paid-cloud-provider route instead of what I’ve suggested above.All that said - I like what you’re trying to build, I could see it being useful to some, but providing E2E photo storage as a direct-to-consumer service is IMHO just asking to be held liable later for what your users store there should you gain any considerable traction."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Was listening to Ben Evan&#39;s podcast earlier today and he had a stat from the Apple / Epic trial that shook me a bit - in a given month in 2016 something like 0.05% of Apple users were spending in excess of 450 USD on in-app purchases.  And that was 54% of App store revenue.This is basically addicts gambling.  Its the sort of numbers you see at Casinos and online casinos, and ... i dunno. It saddens me.  Yes the vast vast majority of players have a &#34;bit of fun&#34;, most never pay for anything, but all the profit comes from the addicts.Even in IOS App Store.  Which really did look like it was trying to avoid that."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Happy to chat about it, HN, since otherwise I&#39;d just be playing more Genshin Impact.My capsule review of the game nobody asked for: if you like Breath of the Wild, you&#39;ll likely enjoy it a lot. It is not as pure of an exploration game at BotW is, and the emergent game mechanics that made BotW such a joy, a toy which produced its own unique stories with every player, are mostly absent. The exploration doesn&#39;t tie in closely with the plot like it does in BotW.But, other than that, it&#39;s an extremely, extremely effective game. Excellent art and music design; the graphics compare favorably to anything I&#39;ve ever seen in an AAA game if you like this anime-inspired visual style.I find the combat similar to single-player WoW with more interesting strategic choices (regarding party comp, etc) and less interesting tactical choices. Harder encounters are fun puzzles to solve.While the actual story in the game is nothing we haven&#39;t seen done better before, the character interactions are an extremely interesting Chinese take on Chinese/Japanese/Western fantasy tropes. Someone could get an East Asian Studies thesis out of it fairly easily. It&#39;s amusing to &#34;read&#34; with that cultural commentary lens on; the localization is also surprisingly well done (including both English and Japanese, to the extent you credit me with being able to perceive that).The metagame about how to progress as quickly as possible, and where to invest your resources / how to harvest them efficiently, also pushes my buttons very effectively."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; Gacha games are named after the onomatopoeia describing vending machines in Japanese malls and arcades which dispense toys and trinkets for, typically, 100 to 200 yen (about $1-$2). The pool of trinkets is displayed prominently on the machine; which trinket you get is effectively randomized. If you had your heart set on a particular one, you might spend much more than $1 on getting it, and some children (and adults!) very much do. Many very successful games have a monetization strategy which descends from a variant of this.I am sorry to say this as someone who usually agrees with &#39;patio11 on everything, but both gacha and the &#34;monetization strategies&#34; inspired by it (be they hawking in-game currency or trying to mine email addresses) sound like a terrible idea.I don&#39;t want gacha, or any of these monetization strategies in my ideal consumption model. I want to look at a toy in the store and buy it while knowing what I am getting. This gacha model sounds like it&#39;s incentivizing gambling from a very young age.Am I too close-minded? Idealistic? Missing some crucial part of the article? I&#39;d like to hear, because nothing seems good about this at the moment."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This web page does a terrible job representing the necessary install steps. It looks super combined but can be combined into three or maybe four commands.I think it would be massively helpful if the devs would upload a DEB/Flatpak file somewhere instead of having compilation instructions as the primary install method. Sure, if you run a funky Linux like OpenSUSE you need to follow and convert installation instructions, but for Ubuntu (which the guide is targeting) you really don&#39;t anymore.That being said, on Arch (and Arch-derived) systems you can find this in the standard software store under the name snis-git if you&#39;ve enabled the AUR."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Hi, author here.  I&#39;m a little hesitant to wade into these comments, but I&#39;ll try to answer a few questions I see popping up, and some that I just made up.1. Why do I have to compile the thing myself?Because packaging on linux is a nightmare.  For a long time, Linus Torvalds did not offer linux binaries for his &#34;subsurface&#34; diving program, but did offer them for Windows and Mac.  Now there are linux subsurface packages, but Linus doesn&#39;t do them himself.  If Linus can&#39;t be bothered to make linux binaries, you know the situation is messed up. I figure, if the game is good enough, then someone (besides me) will make packages.  If that doesn&#39;t happen, well, I guess the game isn&#39;t good enough.  And I&#39;m ok with that.2. Why don&#39;t the devs do this or that?&#34;The devs&#34; is mostly just me. I do what I feel like, this is my hobby project that I do for fun.3. How does this compare to Artemis/Empty Epsilon etc.?It&#39;s more properly 3D than Artemis or Empty Epsilon.  It has a much nicer Lua API for making mission scripts than Artemis&#39;s XML based system.  It doesn&#39;t have as many mission scripts as Artemis or EE. It feels a little more &#34;millenium falcon&#34; than &#34;Enterprise&#34;, mainly due to the turret gun, I suppose.  I think the planets, especially the gas giants[1] in SNIS look cooler than anything in Artemis or EE.4. Why does the game design suck?It&#39;s hard to make a cooperative bridge simulator that&#39;s fun at every station all the time. Back in 2012, I heard about Artemis, and thought it was a cool idea, and it seemed like a neat project, so I started working on my own interpretation of the genre. It&#39;s hard to know how things will turn out without just trying it.  It came out the way it came out (so far).  A lot of the fun in this type of game has to come from the participants. With the right participants with the right attitude, it can be pretty fun. Some parties are fun, some are dull. Alcohol sometimes helps.5. Why doesn&#39;t it run on Windows or Mac?It used to run on Macs, but then support for OpenGL on Macs became problematic.  Maybe someone could get it to run on Macs again, but not me.  It will run on Windows using the Windows subsystem for linux, however, the graphics will be software emulated, which is generally not good enough.  Trying to compile natively on Windows would be a big job.  It uses pthreads extensively, and some other various linux-isms here and there.  Windows and Mac were not a priority for me because I don&#39;t have either of those machines, and I was mainly interested in playing the thing with my friends. Besides, Windows and Mac already have enough games.6. Can you run the game remotely, or does it have to be on a LAN?Maybe. I&#39;ve never seriously tried to run it remotely.  I have tried it once or twice, with the server running on a digital ocean server in New York, with my clients running in Virginia, and it worked better than I expected it to.  It does have a voice chat feature built in (added after COVID appeared), and that seemed to work.  But my test was limited to about 5 minutes of messing around, and only a couple of clients.  Each client will require about 100k/s of bandwidth.  This can be greatly reduced by reducing the number of objects (asteroids and NPC ships) floating around in the simulation, but I haven&#39;t really experimented much with running this thing other than on a LAN.7. Will it work on a Raspberry Pi 4?Yes and no.  Some stations will work. SCIENCE, COMMS, and ENGINEERING seem to work alright.  More graphics intense stations don&#39;t work so well (MAIN SCREEN, NAVIGATION, WEAPONS, GAMEMASTER).[1] https://github.com/smcameron/gaseous-giganticus"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This is actually better for most consumers. The SLC cache was increased nearly three fold and the controller is a superior one (it now uses the same one as the 980 PRO). TechPowerUp[0] has a much better post on this, and you can clearly see there that the new one is better in most cases than the old one.The only ones disadvantaged by this change are people who constantly write &gt;42GB which I would think are video editors. (The old version would get a speed reduction to 1500MB/s after overflowing the SLC cache (42GB), the new one goes down to 800MB/s after overflowing (115GB))P.S.: Not defending this, just clarifying because most posters here seem to believe it&#39;s a straight up downgrade. Should also be worth noting that Samsung changed the product box, product number, firmware version and the spec sheet for this change. So they&#39;re significantly better than the others who have done similar moves. That said, I still believe that they should have called this the 971 Evo+ or something, as it&#39;s genuinely different.[0]: https://www.techpowerup.com/286008/et-tu-samsung-samsung-too..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I used to work in their SSD vertical on the software side. For what it&#39;s worth, SSD/memory business unit is their pride. They never used to cut corners and do rigorous testing to ensure their customers aren&#39;t screwed over. Even when a bad batch of SSDs were shipped by mistake, they would recall/refund all of them proactively. When ever a new model is released, they would first ship limited units to a set of SSD enthusiasts including gamers in Korea. One such time, there was a BSOD reported by a single tester in some edge case - &gt; they sent a lot of team members in person to chase and fix that issue.So I really doubt they would do anything stupid to get some quick bucks at the cost of reputation.On the other hand, their smart tv division is absolute garbage and employees themselves wouldn&#39;t buy Samsung TVs."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The reporting is this case is a little dramatized IMHO. As you can read here [0] they actually use the controller from the 980 Pro and more dense NAND, Billy Tallis from Anandtech filled in some missing technical detail. You actually gain performance in the random 4K case, which is important in day to day operations but you loose sequential write speed if you exceed the SLC-Cache of 115GB.This differs quite significantly from WD silently changing the Blue drive from TLC (okay with Cache) to QLC which nets you write speeds lower than HDDs after the cache is full. Crucial did TLC-&gt;QLC on the P2 too, but you could get those drives for 30% less up until a week ago.(edit) forgot to mention ADATA who switched the controller of their SX8200 Pro [1][0] https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=28320640

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Very few things surprised me as much as rail design when I was studying structural engineering. Surface tension and fluid dynamics were both trippy too, but I expected those things to be complicated and while surface tension blew my mind due to the relative simplicity of the proof, and fluid dynamics blew my mind because it was somehow 100x more complex than I estimated.Walking into rail design was hilarious. I worked on motorcycles and did some car stuff. I figured it was obvious, and sorta dismissed this assignment as a joke. Nope. My dismissive intuitions were just flat out wrong. It kinda leaves an impression on you to sorta avoid saying you know for sure before putting in some amount of work."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Another way to think of how this works is to look at crowned pulleys:https://woodgears.ca/bandsaw/crowned_pulleys.htmlIn the train&#39;s case (if we ignore the gap between the wheels), the pair of wheels work like a crowned pulley, and the track finds center like a belt."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Motorcycles turn at speed by a similar principle, though the cones arrangement is a bit flipped around.I usually demonstrate it with two solo cups put mouth-to-mouth, to make a pair of facing cones that represents the motorcycle tire.  The starting condition is that you&#39;re above parking lot speeds, and the bike is stable and is dynamically inclined to stay perfectly upright.  To go left, you turn the bars right to upset the stable bike onto the left cone, and it goes left.  To go right you turn the bars left and it upsets the bike onto the right cone, and goes right."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"A better headline - users willing to give up privacy for convenience.Reality - there was a period where the icloud backups created backups that apple did not have access to. Critically, this mean that if you had any of a wide variety of things happen - unless you were very good about key management - your content was lost for good. ALL your photos (which could be heartbreaking) etc.It turns out this is NOT what people want. They want apple to have access to their content, so when they have a device stolen and don&#39;t have a super long recovery key properly saved, they are not hosed.Same issue BTW with bitlocker on windows. People DO NOT save those recovery keys, even if they should. Microsoft added a way to force a backup into an account admins and others would have access to, thank goodness, because otherwise users there would be hosed as well."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;m continually surprised that people can&#39;t seem to understand E2EE. For whatever reason they assume it means a message is encrypted forever and unreadable by anyone.There is zero guarantee from any E2EE system that the data is encrypted at rest by the sender and receiver. In fact in most cases, the data is not encrypted at rest because people want to do silly things like read messages.The exact same vulnerability exists  on every platform that&#39;s automatically backing up local data to the cloud. Even if you disable cloud backups you&#39;re still stuck if whoever you&#39;re messaging has left them enabled.The only meaningful way around this hole when it comes to messaging apps is row-level encryption on the backing store. This has a lot of problems of its own and potential holes when it comes to indexing and searching."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"… if you back up your device to iCloud.  (Of course, almost everyone does.)Apple was apparently going to close this loophole, but decided not to.  They probably received negative feedback from the three letter acronym agencies."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I used to work with tungsten carbide cubes during my PhD thesis. They&#39;re used in multianvil high-pressure synthesis. With the right setup you can reach almost 20 GPa of pressure. Not as much as with diamond anvil cells, but you have more reasonable sample sizes (a few milligrams). And thats still like the pressure pretty deep into Earth&#39;s mantle.I also used the opportunity to snap a neat picture of a polished WC cube: https://imgur.com/C2YiMqb.jpgI always had fun handing them over to students because everyone is surprised by the sheer weight of these things.Tungsten carbide is actually quite dangerous after it has been subjected to a lot of stress (Such as being stuck into a 1000 t press for a high-pressure synthesis). They have the mean tendecy to explode into super sharp pieces when you&#39;re not expecting it, so wear goggles."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">" &gt; I struggled a lot with deciding to buy a cube. It felt wrong to spend so much money on a featureless hunk of metal.When I bought my cube, I used it as an exercise to fight back against my frugality.But it wasn&#39;t meant to be: it was delivered to the wrong address and I received a full refund.Then my neighbor delivered it to me."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I got one as well, around the same time actually, as a gift. I also fell into a strange fascination with it and find it fun to hold in the exact same ways as the author. Folks tend to get me 1&#34; element (or sometimes non elemental but interesting in another way) cubes as gifts now which works out as it gives a great range of price to choose from while maintaining surprise with the guarantee I&#39;ll enjoy it.I&#39;ve had my sites set on something this size https://midwesttungsten.com/tungsten-cube/ for a while now. (about as much as I would feel safe setting down or handing to people considering the hard edges and chance of accidents) I&#39;ve more than had the spending money to do it for a long time but much like the author I&#39;ve just had a hard time justifying it. I suppose it&#39;s still less ridiculously than what many spend on car hobbies or whatnot. I&#39;m sure I&#39;ll eventually get something of the nature.I&#39;ll also add I was extremely surprised others enjoyed it as well. Of all of my desk toys/models/prints it&#39;s generated the most talk amongst friends and coworkers.I&#39;d like to experience a sizeable amount of iridium some day  as well.Edit: One of the most fun gifts I&#39;ve received (beyond the tungsten cube) was a 1&#34; magnesium cube. Apart from being a ridiculous fire/blinding risk capable of easily melting through the tungsten cube if set off it is even lighter than  an equivalently sized aluminum cube."</p>

While I haven&#39;t fully kept up, I know in the 90s at least a quarter of the financial district was held by two families. They own a ridiculous amount of the city&#39;s most valuable real estate and getting into office without their approval seems impossible.I&#39;ve been wanting someone to do a deep dive on them forever but it never happens and any analysis that lacks them feels pretty disappointing.[0] https://www.latimes.com/projects/la-pol-ca-gavin-newsom-san-..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt;One City Hall insider suggests that San Francisco overreacts to issues that are in the national news, and designs solutions to the country’s problems rather than its own. For example, when Mr Boudin ran on his platform of less punitive justice, San Francisco already had one of the lowest incarceration rates in the country. In 2019, 106 adults were in prison for every 100,000 people, one-fifth the rate in California and the nation. If the rest of the country behaved like San Francisco, the prison population would decline by 80%, says James Austin of the jfa Institute, a think-tank that evaluates criminal-justice policies.This seems like a very reasonable hypothesis"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Interestin things about Ada:- language designer have a document where they explain their choices, the Ada Rationale:
http://www.ada-auth.org/standards/rationale12.html- there is an annotated version of the standard, and it&#39;s freely available as the standard:
http://www.ada-auth.org/arm.html- A language test suite was developped at the same time of the language:
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ada_Conformity_Assessment_Test...The last point was also in retrospect not sot good for the language ecosystem: buyers wanted a 100% on this test suite before considering your Ada compiler, which means dev had hundreds of compiler bugs to fix and no paying customers."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I worked with Ada a lot during the 90s (and even maintained the Linux port of GNAT early on). This document does not address one thing that I am curious about. What does the modern, idiomatic Ada programmer do about memory management? Are library implementers still required to use Unchecked_Deallocation? I don&#39;t see how a language where Unchecked_Deallocation is used can be considered safe at a time when we have modern choices with automatic memory management.Edit: I guess another way to put this is, &#34;Can a non-trivial project be developed in modern Ada without using Unchecked_Dealloation?&#34; Because I don&#39;t see how I can consider a library safe if it is allowed to call Unchecked_Deallocation."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I went to a college that taught CS in ADA, and I never took CS because I tested out of 101, but I ended up fixing attempts at the problem sets for about half my dorm section (this was okay as long as and they documented it).Well anyway, I found it to be very easy to pick up just by reading, hard to make semantic errors, and easy to modify without breaking things. The pace of learning for the entire cohort, mostly non-CS students, was, I think, much faster than e.g. C++ and possibly more complete than e.g. Python. It’s pedantic and exact, but it uses real english language keywords and modifiers.I went to a different school later where I did the same thing but it was taught in C++. It seemed like many students would get by purely by repeating patterns that they didn’t understand. And I started to catch myself in that trap as well, realizing that I had a lot to learn.But I wasn’t going to be a programmer; I was going to be a theoretical physicist cogitating on the deep mysteries of the universe. Fast forward…. D’ohhhh."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The reason the banks, and through the banks OnlyFans, attack sex is because they are accountable, and don&#39;t wish to take risks unless they are very profitable risks.The real danger of platforms and banks is how happy they are to censor for the government, or simply the loudest, richest mouth, in order to keep the profit flowing. If you want to fix it, you put in legal protections for people to do business, rather than this informal and/or ad hoc regulation through the shifting influence and agendas of arbitrary special interest groups.&gt; The financial and tech industries’ prudishness is unfortunately increasingly reflected in government policy, typically under the guise of protecting children and other vulnerable communities.This is the Guardian getting causation extremely wrong."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This article completely misses the causes of the rule changes. Banks and payment processes pushed new rules because they were being held accountable. The changes were all implemented in response to hugely influential NYT opinion piece on PornHub in December [1] that specifically called out payment processors, and preempted a BBC investigation into OnlyFans that was hinted to do the same [2].The conversation here should about how rulemaking via media outrage is a problem given the public has conflicting morals.[1] https://www.nytimes.com/2020/12/04/opinion/sunday/pornhub-ra...[2] https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-58255865"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"In case any Discord employees are reading this: please don&#39;t remove the ability for bots to read message_content , or make me jump through verification hoops either. Reading raw messages is absolutely crucial for moderation bots and, well, just about every other fun and interesting bot.I don&#39;t write discord bots so you can type a slash command to do a thing. That&#39;s boring. Good bots can read messages. Discord will be very &#34;not dope&#34; and &#34;not cool&#34; if bots are forced to become a sterilized pick-list of interaction options."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;m always very thankful that we even have people that work so hard towards FOSS libraries to begin with. It must feel pretty bad to receive those responses from employees telling him about the things he should do that are &#39;um&#39;, &#39;easy&#39; and &#39;dope&#39; when there&#39;s clearly been many longstanding feature and communication issues already (as if being the person working on a FOSS library for no compensation in your spare time that empowers a company whose employees&#39; are getting 7-8 figure exits within a few years wasn&#39;t already bad enough).My general pessimism with this situation is how proprietary everything has to be to begin with; the idea of a single company storing the full history of everyone&#39;s messages and interactions is already bad enough without them requiring the government ID of their users."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Meanwhile, I see fleets of user-bots happily chugging along under the radar hoovering up data.  Just like the post author said:&gt; the crux of malicious bots were, and still are, user-bots.Seems almost laughable that Discord is making hoops for legitimate bot developers to jump through while taking little action against user-bots.I suspect that Discord wants to get a chunk of the big money that game bot developers are making, and are pushing bot developers into a more rigid API that will eventually include in-app-purchases.  The article author also said:&gt;  No longer will bots thrive with a sandbox limited only by your imagination, but instead Discord is now the sole gatekeeper of approved use cases. The future of Discord bots relies solely on the interaction system; things have to be explicitly written and supported by Discord employees"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Any user of any Facebook property needs to understand well in advance that the company engages in active psychological manipulation and experimentation on its users and then decide if this clashes with their personal autonomy.Remember them talking about how they engaged in experiments on their users by trying to influence their mood via intentionally showing their various groups different types of content algorithmically on their news feed? Or when they intentionally kept crashing their Android app to see what’s their user retention rate even on faulty software? Or just open up the app on two phones of the exact similar make and model and see the app menu?My personal anecdote and experience with this is that they also use random errors to disguise bans. I have a personal and a dev account which I made the first time I accidentally got banned for 24 hours because it also reset OAuth app keys, the next time I got banned I logged in to my dev acct. and tried to make a post, since they managed to associate the two accounts, I ended up banned on that one, too. But it didn’t say that, it kept throwing random errors as if it was only a backend issue. These disappeared once my main ban was gone.So all in all my point is, people should understand that the platform outright does these kinds of things and use or find alternatives based on that"</p>

I have a game on facebook for a decade, where users sometimes try to send some link to their friend through messenger.

FTP was read only for anonymous but it was trivial to download and crack the passwd file and discover that the admin password was something like 1234.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This is a line that resonates with me, and the one which some negative comments might overlook (3 hours in, at least):  &#34;What can you say in this language that would 
  be impossibly inconvenient to say in others? 
  In the process of learning how to say things 
  you couldn&#39;t previously say, you&#39;ll probably 
  be learning how to think things you couldn&#39;t 
  previously think.&#34;

This is one of the value propositions of language. It&#39;s one of the ways we learn new things, and thus become more capable of doing valuable work as people.Criticisms of this essay in comments so far have seemed to fall into these buckets:  1. Lisp? Macros? Boo. (Not novel/too weird/etc)

  2. Languages are solved, not important; I build systems.

  3. I don&#39;t like the tone of this essay.

(1) and (3) are side points, unrelated to thesis. (2) is the interesting one, and at the heart of what the essay talks about.I&#39;ve always been in the pg camp on this one. Sure, systems are the thing, we can&#39;t be purists, etc -- but saying that languages don&#39;t matter, for us, would be like rocket engineers saying that materials don&#39;t matter.If you&#39;re building a table, you can make it out of almost anything; a table is a solved problem. Wood, carbon fiber, steel.But at the limits of what&#39;s possible, like a rocket, the material&#39;s properties, limitations, and weaknesses in extreme circumstances matter.You can definitely imagine that important things are happening, in the maker&#39;s mind, when they start working with a new material, seeing what others are able to do with it, seeing how the making process is easier, or what steps are unimportant/unnecessary now vs. in their usual materials. And that informs their thinking, going forward, about what&#39;s possible in systems they might build."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; Pick a language that most programmers consider weird but whose median user is smartI think this heuristic fails, with my poster-child counter-example being Nock and Hoon, the languages used to implement Urbit.  Those languages are unquestionably weird, and I think their median user is pretty smart -- you have to be pretty smart to use those languages because they are intentionally designed to be difficult to use.  But I don&#39;t see any merit whatsoever in Nock and Hoon, at least not with respect to giving you any leverage in programming.  C++ is another example.  It&#39;s not considered weird, but I think it would be if it were not so widely used.  Again, to use C++ you have to be smart because you have to know the locations of a zillion and one hidden land mines.  But the appeal of these languages is not the leverage they give you, it&#39;s the barrier to entry.  Once you invest the time to learn them you become a member of an exclusive club.  In the case of C++ at least, being a member of the club gives you leverage and opens up employment opportunities.  But that doesn&#39;t make C++ a good language."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Putting aside the other controversial things that Graham says in this post, I think we could find common ground and have some fun technical discussion by focusing on this angle:&gt; What can you say in this language that would be impossibly inconvenient to say in others?The first experience that comes to mind for me was XSLT.  Early on in my technical writing career, I needed to convert the Doxygen output of a C library to a more barebones HTML output (so that the reference docs would have the same branding as the rest of our site). I used XSLT to extract only the bits of HTML that I needed and I transformed them into nice, straightforward, semantic HTML. It took me a while to wrap my head around XSLT&#39;s flow but I was amazed to find that a task that would have taken probably 50-100 lines of looping and condition checking could be accomplished in literally 1-3 lines of XSLT.Would love to hear other&#39;s experiences along these lines (i.e. concrete examples)."</p>

Used social media for promotion?
Pricing structure?If those questions are too profound, feel free to not address them, but either way, this is impressive for a solo Indy dev.And what is the tech stack?

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"How do you deal with data loss if there isn’t a perfect match between the data models? For example, if I’m looking to migrate from GSuite to Microsoft Office365 (or vice versa) and there’s not a 1:1 mapping. Or if the behavior of the same spreadsheet formula is slightly importantly different? These are complicated examples obviously and maybe you’re not tackling them yet, but I think I see (at least as an external observer with limited visibility) a lot of the internal teams really focusing on those corner cases where the data loss path and other migration challenges rather than the happy easy-to-automate piece.Similarly, how do you see this service scaling beyond a boutique consultancy or outside of a handful of cases where it’s easy? If you’re successful, do you think vendors won’t do everything to make your access more difficult or cut you off completely? If you see it more as a “we force the vendors we integrate to sign a mutual agreement” kind of strategy, how do you see yourselves not becoming a gate keeper and velocity bottleneck for feature development (ie company wants to roll out feature X and now they need to involve you first so that you can write migrations to …?)It’s an interesting idea so curious to hear your thoughts about the challenges."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Wix is an interesting choice.  I remember during the recent feud between Matt Mullenweg (Wordpress founder) and Avishai Abrahami (Wix CEO), Matt said this:&#34;They are so insecure that they are also the only website creator I’m aware of that doesn’t allow you to export your content, so they’re like a roach motel where you can check in but never check out.&#34;So I guess there&#39;s probably demand for a nice export tool there."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I have a $100M SaaS in a different space but the underlying tech is identical. I had this idea ~10 yrs ago when we first started writing our own import logic to move users over from competing services.The engineering challenges to make this work flawlessly is going to be substantial to say the least. I GET from ~70 data sources right now...I couldn&#39;t imagine having to GET,POST, CHECKPOINT and DIFF with all the edge cases that appear.Best of luck but this is a very hard problem to solve. Would love to see someone see this through!"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"From https://www.w3.org/People/Berners-Lee/FAQ.htmlQ: I&#39;m a student of visual communications and asked myself why links are blue. I found some answers that might be, for example blue is a color of learning, but I&#39;m not sure what is right. Is there any reason, why links are colored blue ?A: There is no reason why one should use color, or blue, to signify links: it is just a default. I think the first WWW client (WorldWideWeb I wrote for the NeXT) used just underline to represent link, as it was a spare emphasis form which isn&#39;t used much in real documents. Blue came in as browsers went color - I don&#39;t remember which was the first to use blue. You can change the defaults in most browsers, and certainly in HTML documents, and of course with CSS style sheets. There are many examples of style sheets which use different colors.My guess is that blue is the darkest color and so threatens the legibility least. I used green whenever I could in the early WWW design, for nature and because it is supposed to be relaxing. Robert Cailliau made the WWW icon in many colors but chose green as he had always seen W in his head as green.One of the nicest link renditions was Dave Raggett&#39;s &#34;Arena&#34; browser which had a textured parchment background and embossed out the words of the link with a square apparently raised area.[See also https://www.crazyegg.com/blog/why-hyperlinks-are-blue/ which links to the answer above but also contains a few other references.]"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Given the author&#39;s &#34;conclusions&#34; about Windows&#39;s influence here, it&#39;s probably worth mentioning that Windows 3.x (including both 3.0 and 3.1) used green for hyperlinks in its help system by default (which was hypertext but not HTML):  https://i.imgur.com/ZjX5xIW.pngGreen hyperlinks stuck around in the Windows 95 help system, and were eventually replaced when Windows 98 switched to Microsoft&#39;s new HTML Help system which defaulted to blue hyperlinks (inherited from Internet Explorer)."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Mosaic was the first browser I used, and the first I wrote websites for (I still only test in one browser ;) ).Something the article doesn&#39;t touch on is the fact that there wasn&#39;t really such a thing as hex colors like &#34;#0000ff&#34; back then. You could use them, but no one did because they weren&#39;t guaranteed to work properly. There was a list of 256 &#34;web safe colors&#34; that you could use that were the 8 bit palette that most computers supported in VGA graphics (at 640x480 resolution), and then a further list of HTML colors that could be used if the user had a graphics card that could use 16 bit SVGA graphics. Using 24 bit hex code colors didn&#39;t come along until a little later, when computers were likely to display them properly.In other words, links weren&#39;t #0000ff. They were &#34;blue&#34;."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Ansible is abysmal. I don&#39;t know why anyone still chooses it. It&#39;s a mess of yaml and what feels like a million yaml files that is always extremely hard to follow. Honestly writing some python, or bash is a lot easier to follow, read, and understand. The only thing it has going for it is the inventory system. I wish ansible would die already.The tips mentioned in the article are helpful, but still beyond the initial development of roles, maintaining roles is a pain no one can alleviate. It is the perl of automation. I wish people would stop using it. I&#39;ve yet to start a job where people haven&#39;t regretted going towards ansible."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"It&#39;s a damn shame it took until this article for me (and it appears some others) to learn about the console and the debugger; those seem like massive time savers! My own biggest helper has been to use &#34;ANSIBLE_STDOUT_CALLBACK=yaml&#34; wherever &#34;ansible-playbook&#34; is called (https://jpmens.net/2021/03/12/alter-ansible-s-output-on-debu...). It makes the verbose output much more readable and is especially handy for tasks that can spew thousands of lines at ones (e.g. &#34;apt update/upgrade&#34;)."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;m using ansible for some years already. The biggest game changer for me was ansible molecule [0].I integrated it to the repo, where I store my code and it just runs all the test cases for my code. It saved me a bunch of hours of investigation in test environments before I even released the code. Highly recommend to try it even for a small project.Apart of that play with ansible strategies if you have more than one server to apply the role. It really might save you some minutes of a runtime.[0]: https://molecule.readthedocs.io/en/latest/"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Not entirely defending things but observing that if you are of a view that IPR is basically absurd, &#34;stealing&#34; it may be equally absurd, but rational.After you&#39;ve stolen it, it&#39;s still &#34;there&#34; except for the exclusivity.Chips will still exist, fab lines will still run. Profits have tanked, sure. Innovation is probably stifled but that&#39;s an opportunity loss.There&#39;s a long history of stealing IPR at the state level around the world. States do this, private individuals do this, assets get seized everywhere from time to time.&#39;Sovereign risk&#39; has always to be factored in to any business venture, anywhere. Nobody can possibly have been investing millions in China mainland without knowing this risk going in. At this point, &#34;outrage&#34; is part of the negotiating tactics. Outrage won&#39;t really stop this happening here or anywhere else. Bilateral consequences might? What Chinese assets will somebody seize?The German petrochemical and drugs sector was economically robbed postwar WW1 and WW2 and personally I think somewhat rightly so. Bayer made cool drugs, but also helped the nazi party. Russia and America both took things as expropriation. Postwar, but.. does war make this IPR and asset claim really that much better?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"If the current course continues this seems likely to lead to a bifurcation of the Arm ecosystem - presumably with Arm customers outside of China competing with incompatible products exported from China based on Arm China designs.I don&#39;t have any insight into the quality of the Arm China team but isn&#39;t one possible outcome that there is strong competition between the two ecosystems.

								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt;Apple agrees to make sure the search results in the App Store are based on objective criteria.I cant help but laughed when I was reading it. What were they doing before that?I thought the most important part was the next bit,&gt;The settlement, which must be approved by Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers, comes as Apple is awaiting a ruling in a separate lawsuit, brought by Fortnite developer Epic Games, which seeks to force Apple to allow rival in-app payment and store options.&gt;The same federal judge is hearing the Apple-Epic case and a ruling could come at any time.My guess is that the way things are going in these cases are not in Apple&#39;s flavour. And for all the court case I followed over years Apple tends to be the favourite in court. Rightfully or not. ( Some of the Judge are very clearly biased ) But Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers was clearly trying to get to the bottom of things. And asking some very hard questions.Is this enough? I am not sure if Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers is easy to please either. And let&#39;s not forget this is US only. EU are grinding their teeth. Then there are South Korea and Japan. And China is surpassingly quiet in all of these.Phil Schiller was right, if Apple were to ever change its fee structure, that it should do so “from a position of strength rather than weakness”.     It was unfortunate Steve passed away soon after that email."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; Developers can communicate directly with customers about alternative payment options. Customers have to consent and be given the right to opt-out.This is a huge step forward (though it falls well short of the ideal case) for iOS development. Having the ability to tell customers about other, often cheaper, payment methods removes a substantial barrier for some apps that have high-priced subscriptions.Positive as this change is, there is still a lot of ground to be won here. I&#39;m fearful concessions like this will work as legal currency in the Epic case, instead of momentum pushing ongoing shifts in app store policy. Can someone with more legal understanding weigh in on that?"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Congratulations.
It&#39;s not easy! But it can be done. It depends on what your priorities are. Here&#39;s my tips from the time our new baby was born.#1 Set aside time to work
This is the important part, you can&#39;t &#34;work when you&#39;re inspired&#34;. Set aside the 2-3 hours you need per day. At the time I had a full-time job and the baby was born. My partner at the time was a stay-at-home-mom, which helped a lot. But I had duties to be with the baby in the evenings -- feedings, etc. I watched a movie or series with my partner after the baby was sleeping, THEN I went to work when my partner was sleeping.#2 Constraints are important
Because of the minimal amount of time (few hours per day) you have to spend it wisely. In this case, I had a strong to-do list with few distractions. I would work on that list and try to finish a few items (completely) every night.#3 No distractions
No social media was consumed. No YouTube, no instagram, no twitter, tv off. Back in those days these services were just starting anyway, so things were kind of &#34;new&#34;.#4 Motivations
Biggest motivator was my family. Living in New York City was not easy in a nice apartment and a family to support. I knew my side project HAD to work and it DID because I had NO choice. Even with an almost 6 figure job, it would not have been able to do everything, even in 2004.At some point, you have to balance out things. You CAN&#39;t spend all your time with your family.And you can&#39;t spend all your time with your job.You have to have some time for each one. And where people fail badly, is when they spend quantity instead of quality time with kids or work.Believe me, its best to spend less, but QUALITY time with your kids, rather then a whole lot of random time.Your mileage will not vary."</p>

Seeing fully captured motion avatars of people is SO immersive.  It&#39;s absolutely insane how the experience of interacting with people can feel so natural even when they&#39;re on the other side of the planet.I just love watching &#34;body language&#34; of the presenter, it&#39;s such a precise rendering of what a &#34;real life&#34; presentation like this would be.Plus, you meet people like the writer of this blog post, who are so knowledgeable and interesting and fun to talk to."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&gt; there is an important distinction between “working hard” and “maximising the number of hours during which one works”.  In particular, forcing oneself to work even when one is tired, unmotivated, unprepared, or distracted with other tasks can end up being counterproductive to one’s long-term work productivity, and there is a saturation point beyond which pushing oneself to work even longer will actually reduce the total amount of work you get done in the long runWorth highlighting, for those of you that are skipping through."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"If there&#39;s anyone I&#39;ll listen respectfully to about the value of hard, diligent work, it&#39;s Terence Tao.Reminds me of Richard Hamming talking about his professional envy of John Tukey:One day about three or four years after I joined, I discovered that John Tukey was slightly younger than I was. John was a genius and I clearly was not. Well I went storming into Bode&#39;s office and said, ``How can anybody my age know as much as John Tukey does?&#39;&#39; He leaned back in his chair, put his hands behind his head, grinned slightly, and said, ``You would be surprised Hamming, how much you would know if you worked as hard as he did that many years.&#39;&#39; I simply slunk out of the office!From &#34;You and Your Research&#34;: https://www.cs.virginia.edu/~robins/YouAndYourResearch.html"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;ve held for a long time that you must know the rules quite well before you&#39;re &#34;allowed&#34; to break them, and I think this reinforces my opinion on that.Additionally, I think the obsession over &#34;intelligence&#34; and &#34;natural ability&#34; is vastly overstated, in general.  It absolutely helps, and it compounds, to be smart, but a person who &#34;works hard&#34; is infinitely more valuable to their colleagues than a smart person who doesn&#39;t, and tries to rely on raw intellect.My problem, and I wonder if others have this issue as well, is how hard it is to know these things intellectually, and also apply them to my life.  I just cannot, for the life of me, maintain a &#34;work hard&#34; mindset.  I&#39;m still trying, but I very often fail at this, and its frustrating because I know how valuable it is to being good at what I do."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I wonder if this will be good or bad for the competitiveness of China if they are able to enforce it.The company I work in now has no problem competing with Chinese companies working 996, despite us working 7.5h days and having way more vacation days. I believe part of that is that working longer hours doesn&#39;t necessarily make you more productive, as has been discussed in tech communities for a while now.The thing is, to be productive with shorter working hours requires a very different culture. The company I work in now has a very flat structure, and people are encouraged to work on side projects that can improve productivity, and there&#39;s a focus on continuously improving methodology. The last company I worked for was Chinese-American (based in US, but 99% Chinese working there), and it was the exact opposite. Decisions on what to work on was made top-down and results were mainly achieved through brute force. Although since we worked in a somewhat independent office in Europe we ended up with a hybrid system.So the question is, will a shift away from 996 lead to a shift in work culture that increases productivity, or will they just work fewer hours with the same culture?That seems to be the problem for the CCP in general. They want to make improvements, but they don&#39;t really get to the root of the problem. They crack down on after-school tutoring for instance, but they don&#39;t change the Gaokao system, so tutoring will just go underground."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"As a Chinese myself, I&#39;ve been through a lots of this kind of paper reading club. And yes, you read the law you then you roughly know what is illegal. And clearly, those people in the reading club can read paper text in it&#39;s literal means, so that&#39;s a cognitive pass, congrats!However, let&#39;s don&#39;t forget that you cannot form labor union without blessings from the party. Let&#39;s also don&#39;t forget that in China, company can fire people really easily, they just hide those unfair or even discriminatory reasons under the table, no one will help you because helping people is too costly.There is a labor union in China of course, The labor union, called ACFTU, or All-China Federation of Trade Unions. I don&#39;t remember when was the last time they actually sued someone/company, maybe never.Personally, I don&#39;t think those paper laws and paper institutions are actually there to serve the general public. So I don&#39;t even care what they&#39;ve said, nothing will change for the better."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I once had a chinese colleague who came to europe for a few years. She always thought we were lazy for working so short and every argument i brought up about mental health and work efficiency was met with a: &#34;but it works for us&#34;.What i did not understand back then is the absolute replaceability of personel in the chinese market. You work long and hard or tomorrow someone else does it.Not only is this a big reason of the economical prowess of china in my opinion, i fear that this work-ethic will come back sooner or later to europe to &#34;stay competitive&#34;.In the face of bankcruptcy or market pressure... managers tend to make irrational and/or unethical decisions. And they will find a way to circumvent the laws.
I am also sure that chinese companies will find a way to circumvent the 996 ruling here."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I worked at Facebook for some time, and did a bunch of data work. We had this culture of building something, looking at the results between the experiment groups, and then choosing the statistically more successful one -- i.e. a newsfeed algorithm that had better engagement.This sounds great at first, and certainly is straightforward if you want a promotion. But behind the scenes some of us had this thought that our observations only amounted to short-term gains. Although we had small long-term experiment holdout groups, the truth is they were rarely reviewed because it was unsexy.My current thinking is that features like the echo chamber effects from Facebook&#39;s algorithms, Snapchat&#39;s snap streaks, and clickbait like this, all serve to optimize short-term engagement. Yeah, I want to watch that sexy new show or keep my streak going or have my opinions validated. But there&#39;s a diminishing return on clickbait, hollow articles isn&#39;t there? I can only fill up so much time with garbage like that before I&#39;m bored. I can only like so many posts before I feel like they&#39;re all the same. And once my snap streak is broken I hate snapping.The data/engineering/product loops at tech companies favor boosting short-term metrics; The employees are incentivized to do so and this is what they measure, so this is what they build. That&#39;s why we end up with features like this. That&#39;s why Snapchat fell off. That&#39;s why Facebook fell off. And that&#39;s why Netflix feels increasingly stale (despite there being a lot of quality content if you dig)."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is why I quit my Netflix subscription.The algorithm seems to have picked up the fact that I like watching SciFi and Zombie movies, so my Netflix homepage was this dark place filled with Sci Fi and Zombie movies.One problem with this is that Netflix only has a handful of good SciFi and Zombie movies, and I&#39;ve seen them all. So the homepage was filled with movies I&#39;ve seen already, or the dime-a-dozen copycat movies that just rehash some ideas from popular movies in a slightly different way.The much bigger problem is that even though I like watching Zombie movies, I actually enjoy lots of different movies. But somehow the Netflix algorithm only ever shows me this one genre.So I cancelled my Netflix subscription, and went back to occasionally renting a film on iTunes or Amazon. I watch less now, but I end up watching more diverse and more interesting films."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"YouTube is pretty much like this but it&#39;s the creators selecting the thumbnails.The most common thumbnail I see is a picture of someone looks like they are blown away with their hands on their head and their mouth wide open."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"There&#39;s a network of Dutch subreddits, 99% of which are managed by the same clique of mods.Recently I noticed comments I had posted in those subs over the last few months had completely been ignored.It turns out I have been shadowbanned, and not just on the primary /r/thenetherlands sub, but on every single one of the communities they manage.There is no apparent reason for them to have done this to me. My messages to the modteam are being ignored and Reddit support won&#39;t help because &#34;moderators are free to run their communities as they see fit&#34;.I have been locked out of engaging with the communities I was most interested and active in, for no apparent reason and likely forever.And this is just one of many reasons for why having so few moderators control so many communities, is such a bad thing. Allowing them to operate without oversight or accountability is not helping the situation either."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"On the face of it seems strange why anyone would want to moderate popular subreddits, just seems like a lot of unpaid mundane and never ending work.Younger me might of been excited to do it from the perceived status perhaps.I do wonder how many off-site deals are done with moderators and third parties.  There’s a lot of traffic these people are able to steward and influence I imagine."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Funnily enough, I was shadowbanned from the only community in reddit that I was active and cared about (/r/firefox) after respectfully complaining about the redesign in 2 different posts. Maybe there&#39;s a threshold of how many times we&#39;re allowed to complain over there?This was my first shadowban and teached me:a) It&#39;s not worth to invest time in these communities.b) To be shadow-banned is extremely insulting, especially if you didn&#39;t engaged in inflammatory or abusive behavior.c) I will not engage in a community that shadow-ban people even if they have inflammatory or abusive behavior, everyone should, at the very least, understand why they we&#39;re banned and learn from it.Thankfully, nothing of value was lost and now I simply don&#39;t care enough about Firefox or Reddit anymore."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I&#39;m in charge of sourcing components for multiple companies right now.  I believe they could double (100%) prices and companies would pay it.  There&#39;s chips that I&#39;m sourcing from obscure places in China just to get the part and paying whatever price they ask.Designers are getting overwhelmed because they&#39;re having to redesign boards for components that are available, only to realize by the time they finish the changes, the part they redesigned for is also out of stock.There&#39;s been some talk of a Chip-induced cold war, and I would say that&#39;s not crazy given the market conditions. I also love the guy who posts here all the time saying he works for the company that makes the machines that makes the chips and they can&#39;t make more machines because they don&#39;t have the chips that go in them.  XD"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Supply shortage is another way of saying demand excess. I don’t see much evidence that TSMC ever really slowed production, at least for their most advanced processes that are in high demand.This is yet another way we’re all forced to pay the price for cryptocurrency. As long as GPUs are profitable for mining, they will be purchased and put to work. The saddest part is that each additional GPU added to the mining networks only makes the overall system less efficient. Mining difficulty is automatically adjusted upward to cancel out the additional computing power. The networks processed just as many transactions last year as they do now, but countless new GPUs have been added to the mining network due to the incentive structure of mining. It’s a race to the bottom, consuming ever more GPUs and energy until equilibrium is reached.It’s frustrating to watch so much of the output of our most advanced chip manufacturing be diverted straight into making arbitrary proof-of-work systems less efficient so someone can capture incrementally more coins. And now we must all pay higher prices for everything."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"1. This is specifically mainstream node, or everything except leading edge 3nm / 5nm.2. Those price has been like that for sometime since the chip shortage. They just make it official now.3. The mainstream and social media will and always have been blaming it on TSMC.4. Everyone wants all the capacity they need, while not paying a cent more. This announcement will &#34;somehow&#34; made it fair for everyone in the industry.5. The current component price has very little to do with wafer pricing. As with all commodity pricing, they will only swing back once supply catches up.6. In general I think this is a good, TSMC has been leaving far too much money on the table and benefiting GF and SMIC."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Personally, I think the web/browsers has churned far too much, and if that stopped happening, perhaps we would get more accessible sites and browser diversity as people &#34;stop looking for new dogs and start teaching new tricks to the old ones.&#34; Of course, Google would try its hardest to never let that happen, since change is its weapon of monopoly.Related: Stop Pushing the Web Forward (2015) https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=9961613"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"We should also make caniusebutdoesitactuallyworkThis to refer to my annoyance of browser makers leaving incomplete implementations stagnant for years.As an example, the &lt;dialog&gt; element, a browser-native standardized spec as promising replacement for alert. Except that it doesn&#39;t work, it&#39;s inaccessible at its core.And nobody fixes it, it&#39;s just left in this broken state forever.&lt;section&gt;, the element that was supposed to cut up an HTML document into multiple outlines, hence making componentized SEO-optimized headings easy and better, do nothing at all.CSS columns, a simple and easy way to distribute text, were unusable for 8 years because Mozilla refused to fix their own small bug. Which pales compared to the extraordinary amount of Webkit bugs that are absolutely never ever fixed.Form controls, since the very invention of them, are terrible. It has cost the world billions, as worldwide every single developer and project has to reinvent some of them, often breaking basic accessibility in the process.I could go on, but I&#39;ll sum it up as the failure to address extremely common real world problems, and to just let broken buggy solutions linger. When you accept a standard and implement it, bloody finish the implementation. Fix bugs. Otherwise, what is the point?I&#39;d call this hardening the web. There&#39;s no reason I can see why you can&#39;t harden it whilst also making progress on new features."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Another example of this is SharedWorker.Here it is in the standard: https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/workers.html#dom-shar...Safari/Webkit removed it in 2015 (edit: maybe even earlier!) and never reintroduced it:
https://caniuse.com/sharedworkersHere is the apparent reason for cherry picking features:&gt; The implementation of Shared Web Workers was imposing undesirable constraints on the engine. It never gained any adoption.https://stackoverflow.com/a/48193804Edit: Here is the ticket for it’s reinclusion https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=149850Turns out it was removed temporarily because of internal architecture changes, and never reintroduced because of lack of adoption. Of course the biggest barrier of adoption is Safari not supporting them, so talk about a self fulfilling prophecy.&gt; This feature was originally removed temporarily during multiprocess bring-up, and actual usage on the web has been pretty low. We&#39;re willing to reconsider if there is significant demand."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I manage hundreds of linux servers... from my windows desktop and mac laptop.This will be super unpopular, but Linux missed the desktop boat 20 years ago, and my feeling as someone who at the time built his gentoo OS&#39;s from source, it was the fault of a few things:1) Fragmented gui development. There were too many projects with none focusing on really making a better gui than mac/windows.2) A lack of bread and butter 1st class &#34;business&#34; apps - you know, office. OpenOffice is fine, IF you are ok with the janky ui and no one knowing how it works.3) lack of open source exchange type mail/cal/etc server and outlook-like client). Holy fudge, I tried to get this going and people just crapped on me for suggesting it.4) Until recently, installing on laptops was an absolute crap shoot.5) Just, apps, in general. Gimp is fine, but it has never been close to photoshop. GUI standards are all over the place, etc. People go to a platform because it has the tools they want. The real fallout from point 1 is no one would ever port apps to linux (a little hyperbolic - a lot of high-end post production apps and audio apps all made it over). Open source yadda yadda, thats nice (this is not a brush off, it IS nice), but the ecosystem could be light years ahead of where we are now."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"As someone new to Linux from 20 years on a Mac -- what&#39;s the deal with everything being free?Seriously, where are the &#34;take my money&#34; opportunities. I don&#39;t want free OpenOffice. I want to pay $100 for something better, whatever the heck that is, maybe a little less clunky. I don&#39;t want free open source Notes app, I want to pay for something that&#39;s polished.The Linux community is incredibly giving and passionate and it seems like it&#39;s all &#34;free&#34; but sucks up my time. I couldn&#39;t even figure out how to slow the scroll of my trackpad on Ubuntu after lots of digging.Please, coming as a Mac user, take my money."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I don&#39;t use Linux b/c it&#39;s the best desktop.  I use it for two fundamental reasons:1. With enough time and effort I can make it do whatever I want it to do (that can be done).2. I&#39;m a Python web developer and we deploy to Linux so it means I only really need to learn one OS (time to learn is in limited supply for me as man who cares about family life).What this means practically for me is that 95% of what the OS provides works the way I want it to.  I have a handful of things I customize and I&#39;ve scripted those (Linux is great for scripting) so it&#39;s easy to apply when I refresh my OS every 1-2 years.It also means I don&#39;t have to do things the Apple way, I can make it work the way I want it to work (within reason).It also means I don&#39;t have an OS that will put advertisements in the start menu (that was the last straw for my family using Windows, everyone uses Linux now).I realize if I was a lawyer and needed Microsoft Office or a designer and needed the Adobe Suite, then I couldn&#39;t take this approach or would need to run a different OS in a VM.  I wish the Linux desktop would be an attractive target for all popular commercial apps to support it.  But I&#39;m not holding my breath, that&#39;s not why I use it."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Thank you for sharing. I read this a while back and it still hits me just as hard. My brother passed away nearly 6 years ago and left under similar circumstances to the author&#39;s father. He also left a tattered, and similarly-chaotic journal.I was really torn about reading it at first, but he was the type of person who wanted to go ahead of the pack and clear the path for others. His journal was the last way for him to do that.He was older than me and, reading it years after his death, it&#39;s shocking to see the differences between our lives at the same ages. He always seemed older and wiser, but now -- having just turned the age he was when he died -- I realize why he felt so lost and lonely. Being an adult in your mid-twenties is difficult. I have it easy, and I&#39;m having a hard time. Throw in years of battling addiction and no college education, and you can&#39;t help but feel the entire world is against you.Losing an older sibling is a strange experience. The longer you go without them, the smaller the age gap between you becomes. Eventually, you&#39;re older than they will ever be -- I haven&#39;t reached that point yet but just thinking about it puts a lump in my throat.I&#39;ve considered publishing bits and pieces of his story on a blog, or in a book, someday. Anything that could help people in his (or my) situation feel less alone. Although, I don&#39;t think it would be much help considering his story ended.Not sure why I posted this comment. There&#39;s not much substance here other than evidence of another touched soul."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Thanks for this article and hit me really hard. My mom passed away unexpectedly a few weeks ago. She was just starting to enjoy retirement and time being a grandmom. Her journals were note books and mostly documents of what she had done in two year of retirement and things to do with the boys. It&#39;s so hard to look at the plans of things to come and what she was thinking of... like the planning of my oldest son&#39;s 9 3/4 birthday in a year because he&#39;s so in to Harry Potter. It&#39;s a unique treasure to see the inner workings of her mind and something I wish everyone got to experience after a parents passing. We&#39;ve left the stack of them out at her house so the rest of my siblings can go through them as the pass through."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This really moved me. My dad went through brain surgery last year and his four sons converged from around the country. We all barely speak to each other. A holographic will was produced, ten loose leaf pages in impossible handwriting, the last few pages written by him right before he went into surgery while his fourth wife held the pad and guided his hand with a pen. I wish we had conducted ourselves with grace, but two of my brothers are lawyers, so we&#39;re shouting at each other in his house while he&#39;s having a full craniotomy. Luckily he survived and is back somewhat in his faculties for now, and seems cognizant that he doesn&#39;t want to leave this strife behind between his wife and his kids. But this still made me choke up because there&#39;s not much anyone can do. I think about my dad&#39;s regrets and his father&#39;s and see them repeated in myself and my brothers. None of us knows what we&#39;re really doing, do we? We&#39;re all trying our best to pretend we have some control."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Agreed on all points.Interesting to see this:&gt; You can argue that all of this has existed for a very long time, back from the days of all kinds of toolbars and extensions that created multiple levels of address bar nesting in your web browser and taskbar.What I find ironic about the whole situation is, back then it was universally known that those toolbars and extensions are distributed by assholes. The whole software category was called by various pejorative names - &#34;adware&#34;, &#34;spyware&#34;, &#34;malware&#34;. There was a whole ecosystem of tools and tricks to get rid of them, as well as preventing them from being installed in the first place.Something weird happened over the past decade. We find ourselves in times where most mainstream software from renowned companies should be, by the standards of the toolbar era, classified as malware."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This article is globally so true, but there is a major error:It is not &#34;needs of developers&#34; the problem, but the &#34;needs of product manager,  marketing, c-level asshole&#34;.Like for telemetry, most of the time the business side &#34;can&#34;, so they do.And again, for specific app and co, most developer would complain and not like release such user-hostile software but  they are forced by business to do it.Like this stupid project manager that thinks that his product/software is the most important in the world and there is no reason why a random user would not want to install it and also that the user computer belongs to him and to the company because he is using the product, without shame."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Oh man, I just ran into this. I work on a product that has a 3rd party API so other people can write plug-ins to extend the functionality of the app. It&#39;s great for users and developers. We received a bug report related to a particular plug-in, so I went to download their demo to see if the problem was on our end or theirs before contacting them. Here&#39;s how the process went:1) Go to their website and click &#34;Download&#34;
2) Prompted to enter email address with no way to opt out. Shit. Go to mailinator.com and create a fake email address to enter. Enter it.
3) Wait for them to send the real download link to my fake email.
4) It came in almost instantly. Great! Click on the link.
5) Click to download the installer package. Wait a few minutes.
6) Run the installer package.
7) It needs the same email address and password so it knows I&#39;m a &#34;legitimate user&#34; just to install the thing.
8) After entering it, it kicks me back to the web page for some reason. No idea what it&#39;s looking for or what I&#39;m supposed to do on the web site, so I go back to the installer. Oh it&#39;s not an installer. It&#39;s an installer installer. It&#39;s going to download the installer I want from a list of dozens of possible installers. Download the real installer.
9) Run the real installer - It lists dozens of products. Find the one I want. Install it.
10) Prompted for email and password again.And keep in mind this is all before I&#39;m actually a customer. I haven&#39;t paid anything and am trying to evaluate the software to determine if it fits my needs. (Or I would be if I were an end user.) Honestly, if this weren&#39;t for my job, I would have given up on step 2. Fuck these people. I&#39;m trying to save them time by seeing whether the bug is ours or theirs, but they&#39;re actively wasting mine and everyone else&#39;s who downloads this crap."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This happens to video games also. Publishers give review copies with microtransactions not included, the reviewers review it, and then shortly after release they add their free-to-play garbage so they get reviews that don&#39;t take the microtransactions into account and then they add it later.The also do it during ESRB submission to get around having to have a label that mentions in-game purchases. I&#39;m surprised ESRB lets them get away with it, actually.Jimquisition on it: https://youtu.be/9LeZ89_u2GcArticle on it: https://www.tweaktown.com/news/66889/publishers-delaying-mic..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Why is this not fraud?If you as a company source a device for reviewers and then change the specs in a way that you do not communicate, that is intent to defraud.If you bought a corvette because all the car reviews said it went 0-60 in 5 seconds, and then you buy one and it takes 10 seconds to do the same thing, you’d have a pretty good argument - especially if everyone else experienced your same situation.I’d be surprised if a class action suit or FTC investigation doesn’t happens within the next year."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I&#39;m very happy to see that Sailfish keeps shipping because more alternatives are always good.I tried to use it a while ago (Sailfish 3) but was driven off it because of the huge gap between the marketing and the actual reality.The claim that they are privacy and security focused was total bogus (and perhaps someone can comment if it still is).To use the phone features, a Jolla account is needed, so it will &#34;ping home to Jolla&#34;. Privacy policy is pretty standard, so they reserve the right to track you all they want and of course, this is tied to your license, payment method etc. So much for privacy focused...What fully drove me off was that they launched full disk &#34;encryption&#34;, but the LUKS encryption-key password they used was the user&#39;s numeric pin (4-8 digits long). So encryption keys could be bruteforced by a kid and they seemed to be fine with it (I don&#39;t know if nowadays it supports a passphrase).Then I also learned that apps in the &#34;app-store&#34; were not signed in any way so impossible to certify that what you are installing is actually coming from the app repository etc. the phone was just lacking basic security all over the place.I hope they are closer now to closing the &#34;gap&#34; between their marketing and the reality."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I use Sailfish on a Sony Xperia XA2, as well as an iPhone and Android phone.The Sailfish UI far outclasses those other two. It&#39;s simple, consistent, and pretty. That&#39;s all one can ask for! And it&#39;s familiar Linux underneath, with easy access through SSH - no rooting required. This is the phone that everyone else wants, whether they realize it or not...In comparison, I find iOS annoyingly inconsistent and obtuse. Android is straightforward, but feels like a step backward.I just wish Jolla had bigger investors, and more developers. It&#39;s really a breath of fresh air in the claustrophobic (and increasingly dystopic) mobile landscape..."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I&#39;m confused. Where does this say the vaccine is mRNA? The Valneva VLA15 website explicitly states &#34;VLA15 is a multivalent recombinant protein vaccine&#34; [1], and the linked press release calls it a &#34;investigational multivalent protein subunit vaccine&#34;. Does nobody actually read these things?See [2], &#34;Subunit Vaccines&#34;.[1] https://valneva.com/research-development/lyme-disease/[2] https://www.niaid.nih.gov/research/vaccine-types"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Prepare to read the headline &#34;mRNA vaccine trial for &lt;...&gt;&#34; a lot in the future. My guess is that they are going to produce mRNA versions of basically any vaccine (and then some) in the future. The nice thing about the technology seems to be that you only need to exchange the mRNA payload while the surrounding delivery method can be reused. That makes it not only a fast method to create a vaccine but a very convenient way as well. Nice side effect might be that for the next pandemic, we might have doses for everyone ready at the moment the trials are done.
Take that with a giant grain of salt because I&#39;m not in the industry."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I actually had Lyme disease when i was younger. Curiously enough, i didn&#39;t get the somewhat common rash after the tick bite, but instead it was discovered later, as a part of blood testing. I was submitted to that after my relatives had concerns about how lethargic i was being, as well as because i was experiencing joint pain, which the blood test later seemed to confirm.If i recall correctly, i was given antibiotics and felt pretty bad for a month onwards, though nowadays i&#39;m not aware of any lingering long term effects, apart from maybe my short term memory being slightly worse than i&#39;d expect it to. Of course, i think that in my case i had it pretty easy, since some other folks are known to develop symptoms that are considerably more worse. Whether there will be any lingering consequences in my future because of it, only time will tell.A vaccine would definitely be welcome, especially because of how common ticks are here in Eastern Europe - any walk in the forest might end with more than one of them on your clothes. If you have dogs, you&#39;ll probably have to remove dozens of those from their fur every summer."</p>

I&#39;m pushing 60 and I&#39;ve attempted to interview for developer jobs over the last year. Got nowhere despite 40 years of experience. Getting really, really tired of this industry&#39;s attitude toward people like me.Based on questions below, I&#39;ll give a bit more. Earlier this year I had a personal referral into Facebook for a developer position. They do hiring centrally. A very young person in the HR department spoke to me, put me in the central database, and apparently shopped my experience around to a number of different groups. No takers. No one wanted to interview me, so the application died. Never did a tech assessment.So now I&#39;ve started a new group, and I expect this thing is going to generate a lot more money than any work at Facebook ever would. So Facebook did me a favor. Still, it rankles."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I naively moved from New York to Silicon Valley when I was 52. Not saying there isn’t age discrimination in NYC, but here it’s a nightmare.The drop in my interview track record since  my 40s is stark. 2 years ago, after 6 months during which I failed to get 6 jobs for which I interviewed, I made it to the final round for a position at a startup and was subjected to the usual all-day grilling. The CEO was an older man and the hiring manager was in her late 40s, but all the other interviewers were in their early 20s. I left convinced I had nailed the interview and feeling optimistic. On the way home, the hiring manager, bless her soul, took the unusual step of calling to tell me the team had overruled her own enthusiasm for hiring me and she felt terrible about it. Without saying it in so many words, she made it plain it was because of my age.The age discrimination here extends beyond getting hired. I’ve been subject to cruel jokes and shunning in the workplace that, were I in another disenfranchised group, would be labeled workplace harassment and likely subject to strong discouragement by management at the very least.Some people in these comments ask the source of the age discrimination as if they are skeptical and astonished, Astonished!! such a thing could be going on. They look for a rational explanation. Here’s the explanation: we are tribal animals. From young people’s perspective, they are “Us” and we olds are “Them.”Sometimes young people are conscious of their hostility toward us and sometimes not, but that’s it. It requires no explanation more than that.It’s traumatic to be subjected to treatment like this, to the point I have stopped looking for a job. Humans are not built to tolerate constant social rejection, and it’s more important for me to be alive than to be wealthy. I’ve withdrawn from the tech world and started a business that will not make me and my family wealthy, but will support us, albeit with modest means.I hate the fact that I have become a bitter old man at 57!! I hate that Silicon Valley has come to this!!I’m working through my bitterness and will get over it someday. And I will have the good fortune to leave this dystopia."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; The hiring process is in the form of a paid, short-term consulting gig that will lead to a full-time offer if we like you and you like us. We&#39;ll give you some tasks, you&#39;ll get them done, and then we&#39;ll talk. No need to quit your day job to do this gig; we&#39;ll work around your schedule.Interesting. I look forward to hearing if this works out long term. I&#39;d be worried about legal implications of something like this but IANAL."</p>
