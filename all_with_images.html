								<p class="story__comment_others">"Back in the 90s I bought a book that came with some floppy disks.  The book was about 500 pages of clip art, and the disks were the actual images.  At the time, people said such things would put graphic artists out of business.What actually happened is that it put mediocre graphic artists out of business and highlighted the difference between one that was mediocre and one that was good.I feel like this will happen again here with digital artists.  The mediocre ones will be indistinguishable from AI, but the good ones will still stand out."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Gorbachev secured his place in history by what he didn&#39;t do. While never endorsing the end of the eastern bloc, he made it clear beginning in the late 1980&#39;s that unlike his predecessors, he would not oppose democratic reforms in Eastern Europe by force. To general astonishment, he kept this promise, and with the regrettable exception of Lithuania this commitment to not repeating the crimes of his predecessors is Gorbachev&#39;s greatest legacy. In 1988 you would have been hard pressed to find anyone who could imagine the mostly peaceful collapse of the Eastern Bloc, but Gorbachev had the moral courage to accept this once unimaginable consequence of his policy and to see it through."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"RIP Gorbachev, one of the few genuinely good people in politics.After he retired from politics, he was featured in several advertisements:- In 1994 for Apple Computer: https://www.upi.com/Archives/1994/10/07/The-first-advertisem...- In 1998 for Pizza Hut: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gorbachev_Pizza_Hut_commercial- In 2000 for the ÖBB, the Austrian railways: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bLscz8kEg6c- In 2007 for Louis Vuitton: https://www.nytimes.com/2007/11/05/business/media/05vuitton...."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Hard to know the man behind the image, but Gorbachev seemed like a fundamentally decent man, who was perhaps over his head at a moment no one could be reasonably be expected to prepare for. Still, with him at the helm of the sinking ship, chaos and conflict was at least avoided, or at least deferred, and for that we should be thankful. RIP"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I would say: Writing is a test. It tests if you understand the subject well enough, and the &#34;other person&#34; well enough, to communicate it to that other person. Most likely you don&#39;t so then you need to think and/or learn more so that you can redraft it so it works. Write something technical and it reveals how little you know!---It is a trope but it works: Write your problem to the most senior developer in an email/slack but don&#39;t press send. Then there is a probably 50% chance you will solve it, or reduce the scope of the problem to {more focuesed question} that you can ask about."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I think most are vastly underestimating the impact of Synthetic AI media - this is at least as big as the invention of film/photography (century-level shift) and maybe as big as the invention of writing (millenia-level shift). Once you really think through the consequences of the collapse of idea and execution, you likely to tend think the latter...What we&#39;re seeing now are toy-era seeds for what&#39;s possible - e.g. I&#39;ve been making a completely Midjourney-generated &#34;interactive&#34; film called SALT:
https://twitter.com/SALT_VERSE/status/1536799731774537733That would have been completely impossible just a few months ago. Incredibly exciting to think what we&#39;ll be able to do just one year from now.."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"It&#39;s impressive how all of this is quickly picking up steam thanks to the Stable Diffusion model being open source with pertained weights available. It&#39;s like every week there&#39;s another breakthrough or two.I think the main issue here is the computational cost, as - if I understand correctly - you basically have to do training for each concept you want to learn. Are pretrained embeddings available anywhere for common words?"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"As a tech lead, when you&#39;re asked to deliver more, the first impulse tends to be asking your team &#34;how can we do more work?&#34;The correct question should be &#34;What can we NOT do?&#34; - and usually there&#39;s a long list of things that don&#39;t generate business value - from processes, meetings, reporting and overly detailed planning sessions to technical hurdles including slow builds, pre-check in hooks, sign off requirements etc.I know that most feel that they absolutely HAVE to do these things, since there are part of the business process/ definition of done/company guidelines etc... but here&#39;s the thing: If your team delivers value, people stop asking questions. It might take some forceful pushback and even some fights initially, but even if your team is absent from meetings or doesn&#39;t jump through every hoop, as long as you churn out value, you make yourself, your superiors and the business as a whole look good and in turn will be cut some slack."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"A while back I took a couple years off from working. Sometimes I&#39;d still find myself saying &#34;I&#39;ve just been too busy&#34; when asking myself why I didn&#39;t get something done. Didn&#39;t take long to realize that &#34;I&#39;m too busy&#34; had been an excuse I had been using to justify poorly thought out priorities. I still haven&#39;t fully broken the &#34;I&#39;m too busy&#34; pattern but at least now I know there&#39;s a decent chance that I haven&#39;t actually been too busy and I need to look more at what it is that I have been doing and whether or not those things are truly more important than whatever I was &#34;too busy&#34; to do."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"In a team of specialists, it can kill the whole nice plan if one leaves for annoyance about productivity. People get offers all the time on linked in, don&#39;t give them a reason to listen.One time I left because I could rarely do my actual job. Meetings, wasting time with bad internal tools, having useless complex processes, nobody wanting to take responsibility for final decisions.I totally work (paid or flex) overtime, if I have the feeling of productivity in the normal time. But not if the company or project structure is a time wasting machine where you learn nothing but how to be annoyed."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"You did this? Nice job!&gt; Please also check out Keysharp, a WIP fork of IronAHK, another complete rewrite of AutoHotkey in C# that tries to be compatible with multiple OSes and support modern, v2-like AHK syntax with much more features than this one. In comparison, AHK_X11 is a lot less ambitious and more compact, and Linux only.Fascinating, lots to check out here. Thank you.BTW this kind of work falls into poweruser tools IMO, which is an important area for cultivation of Linux Desktop focus. Traditionally in the Linux community this has been more of a distro-maintainer&#39;s support choice (offer poweruser tweaks and tools, or not) so it&#39;s always nice to see new distro-independent, non-dev-poweruser options coming into being."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I see the benefit in this, having one script that works everywhere.It&#39;s also good to know linux has autokey (https://github.com/autokey/autokey) for the same result. The name is close, but it&#39;s a different project.It&#39;s not compatible with autohotkey, but you can script using python. I used it to enter dates, emails and automatize dynalist.io actions."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"One of the stated goal of MV3 by Google[1] was to avoid extensions with broad permissions:&gt; our new declarativeNetRequest API is designed to be a privacy-preserving method for extensions to block network requests without needing access to sensitive dataThis MV3-based AdGuard extension still requires a broad permission to &#34;read or modify host data&#34; on all sites[2]:    &#34;host_permissions&#34;: [
      &#34;&lt;all_urls&gt;&#34;
    ],

So what you have now is the same required permission to &#34;read or modify host data&#34; as with MV2, but with a network filtering engine capabilities gated by Google (an advertising company).We can&#39;t innovate anymore the filtering capabilities of our content blocker engines as we have been constantly doing over the years.For a recent example, there has been discussions lately with filter list maintainers of whether uBO should support AdGuard&#39;s proposed capability of being able to support pattern-matching for `domain=` filtering option[3] (uBO supports AdGuard lists).That sort of proposition is not possible to entertain with MV3 since only Google get to decide how the filtering engine will evolve, if at all. All content blocking issues will have to be resolved with the Google-controlled filtering engine, and left unaddressed if the solution can&#39;t be shoehorned in the declarativeNetRequest API.* * *[1] https://blog.chromium.org/2020/12/manifest-v3-now-available-...[2] https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Add-ons/Web...[3] https://github.com/AdguardTeam/CoreLibs/issues/1550* * *Edit: removed stray `[` character."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Manifest v3 is going to be a slaughter. Extension developers have known the slaughter was coming, but Chrome users are going to be taken by surprise. Many free Chrome extensions aren&#39;t going to get updated at all for v3, because it&#39;s too much work. Many aren&#39;t going to work right anymore because of the new restrictions. And ad blocking aside, v3 seems like a nightmare in general, and still quite buggy. The service workers vs. background script issue discussed by AdGuard will affect many or most extensions.I&#39;ve been postponing the migration of my extensions to v3 for as long as possible. One extension should be fine, but the other one... I&#39;m afraid of what that&#39;s going to be like."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Correction:Analytics &amp; Ad Blocker by Globemallow.io https://globemallow.io/ was the first Manifest v3 Ad Block extension.I first published on 06/22/2022.Last night actually I asked if AdGuard would want to license the software, and sent them a link to my extension. They are aware they weren&#39;t the first, and made this post after knowing it."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"You don&#39;t say where you are located, but unless you are in one of the few places where Dell doesn&#39;t offer on-site next business day support then XPS 13 is a great laptop.Their support is amazing: &#34;We&#39;re not sure what is causing it, but we&#39;ll send someone to replace the whole motherboard tomorrow.&#34; &#34;OH, your currently halfway across the world on a island? No problem, we&#39;ll be there tomorrow&#34;I really don&#39;t understand how it&#39;s done. Clearly they must have parts distributed ahead of time.I&#39;m just amazed that it&#39;s included in the price considering the cost of sending a technician out to a customer. The fact that even here on HN a lot of people think Apple&#39;s support is good suggests that Dell might be able to save a ton of money by lowering their support level, so I don&#39;t really get why they offer it."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I absolutely love my Framework laptop for dev. I feel the software support is also quite good, at least for Fedora which is explicitly supported. I got the DIY edition and put everything together, including installing Fedora, in under 1 hour. And I&#39;m a really slow guy, haven&#39;t build a computer in 10 years - its too easy with framework.This laptop is really build to be repairable and modular and it does not suck at all. I think it will last a long time.The ability to choose your own edition also means I got a reasonably affordable laptop with loads of RAM, which I find is quite useful for development."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Please excuse the long-winded answer...I have also given up on Apple, but mostly because I can&#39;t see the value in it anymore, otherwise my experience with them has been satisfactory (Intel CPU models).For the past few years I used a Microsoft Surface Pro because it seemed to have good build quality and high screen resolution, but despite this I have had to replace it as part of a recall due to a graphics hardware issue, so it was not without its flaws. On a side note, I found the Windows OS to be OK for non-dev work, but would always &#34;work&#34; on the Linux subsystem... so even though Windows supports it quite well, I would just suggest 100% Linux.For 2022 I decided to buy a &#34;gaming&#34; laptop and switch to 100% Linux. The build quality is a little lower than Apple, and the screen resolution is not as good as Apple or Surface Pro, but it is still good, and when using my external monitor there is no difference.The benefits are clear, however, for less than 50% of the cost I am getting superior performance, discrete GPU, excellent cooling, and NO LOCK-IN. There is also the added benefit of being able to play the occasional video game with great performance.So far I don&#39;t regret it."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"We have this kind of censorship in India as well, even the in weirdly innocous places. In James Bond movies, and I think Gone Girl as well, scenes were by zooming into character&#39;s faces or just straight cuts.This is probably the only reason I maintain a US iTunes accounts (used to have to buy gift cards from sketchy sites online to keep this going, but I recently discovered that my Indian Amex card works fine with a US address).Also trivia for those who are wondering how cuts are made, at least for cinema content: all video and audio assets are usually sent to theatres in full, but there&#39;s an XML file called the CPL (composition playlist) that specifies which file is played from which to which frame / timestamp in what sequence. Pure cuts or audio censorship can be handled by just adding an entry to skip the relevant frames or timestamp, or by specifying a censor beep as the audio track for a particular time range.https://cinepedia.com/packaging/composition/"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The solution to this is, of course, piracy. I&#39;m glad people like those on /r/DataHoarder preserve media in their complete forms so I don&#39;t have to watch them censored.A recent example is Community which has an episode of a character dressing as a dark elf, and the joke is that another character  assumes it&#39;s blackface, even though it&#39;s not. Well, networks and streaming services now removed it and unless you have the original discs, you simply can&#39;t watch that episode.Unless, of course, you pirate it, which is how I watched it."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I can see how this might backfire. You notice a censored jump and start to feel the itch of curiosity as to what it concealed. I had to watch several of the censored scenes whereas I would have never just randomly watched clips of the show.Also, love the presentation on this page."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Believe it or not, my journey to Y Combinator started similar to how you may experience YC — through being a regular lurker and reader on Hacker News.I went to Startup School, me and my cofounders applied, we got an interview, and we got in. I was an engineer, designer and PM. I&#39;d built teams and products, but I&#39;d never built a company.YC gave me a shot, a community, knowhow, and the ability to access capital, talent, and customers.YC changed my life. I want it to help a lot more people achieve their dreams and goals. It did for me, beyond my wildest dreams."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I guess everyone Garry has blocked on Twitter will not be applying to YC any time soon :)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"(Throwaway because it’s a small world)This is disappointing.YC needs a fresh perspective. Recycling older members is not a positive sign for continued innovation. I wouldn’t point to “HODL diamond hands” crypto hype (suddenly disappeared..) and personal brand-building content creation as the type of leadership YC needs at this stage.Specifically in this, someone who has been running a large VC fund for the past half-decade with considerable inside deal access through YC. The conflicts of interest are sizable, and we can’t really pretend that they won’t compound now that Garry’s at the head of YC.Lastly, to balance flood of positive reviews, there have been consistent (if quiet, again, small world) reports of pettiness and using power/influence against personal grudges. I have not worked with Garry directly, founder friends have and back channels are..not same as the public comments here. Everyone has weaknesses. This isn’t a good one for the position."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I co-develop a FOSS VPN-based (tcp/udp) firewall for Android.The original policy is documented here: https://web.archive.org/web/20220818100735/https://support.g...What the post misses is Google has exceptions for:- Parental control and enterprise management apps.- App usage tracking.- Device security apps (for example, anti-virus, mobile device management, firewall).- Network related tools (for example, remote access).- Web browsing apps.- Carrier apps that require the use of VPN functionality to provide telephony or connectivity services.The part where manipulation of ad-based monetization isn&#39;t allowed has always been there in one form or another.A firewall can also be used to firewall ads/trackers though, and so it remains to be seen what Google makes of such apps (there are plenty!) come November (supposed deadline for compliance).

As another commenter said, a reminder of the whimsicalness of the 90s internet.sigh, then along came Comet Cursor to remind us why we can&#39;t have nice things:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comet_CursorThe &#34;can&#39;t have nice things&#34; part comes from the tracking that came along with it.

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Fashion trends are currently rebelling against the understated 2010s by bringing the late 90s/early 2000s aesthetic back in the form of wider fits and louder colors. Makes me wonder if/when we might see a similar change in web design, or even furniture. I might be biased as a younger person without many memories from that era, but I&#39;m all for some change (barring impacts to accessibility) if it breaks up the monotony of the corporate-lite graphic design trends of the mid 2010s."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The cursor lag is really bad, particularly on Windows, but there are at least 2 ways the lag could be much lower:1. Use &#39;desynchronized&#39;, e.g. canvas.getContext(&#34;2d&#34;, { desynchronized: true });2. Instead of using requestAnimationFrame(), draw as soon as a move event is received.Here&#39;s a paint app that uses techniques 1 and 2 to achieve much lower input lag drawing the pen strokes that chase the cursor:https://paint.js.org/Two other tricks to be aware of:3. [Chromium only.] Use &#39;pointerrawmove&#39; to get move events as soon as they happen instead of waiting for a big bunch of coalesced moves to all arrive after a delay.4. Drawing where the cursor is predicted to be in order to compensate for lag works well during smooth cursor/pen motion. For example, the Windows Snip &amp; Sketch tool actually renders the line you are drawing in front of the direction your pen tip is detected traveling because when using, say, a Microsoft Surface Pen on a physical Surface Pro screen the line being drawn would otherwise noticeably lag behind the physical pen tip (especially on a 60Hz screen) unless this predictive trick is used.Finally, be aware of open Chromium issue #992954. When the devtools are open [F12], coalesced events aren&#39;t used so you get lower input lag but more events to pump (like &#39;pointerrawmove&#39;). This bug is maddening because it depends on whether or not you have the debugger open!https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=992954"</p>

Feel free to use my code to implement other features like classification according to chosen topics if you&#39;d like it.[0] https://web.archive.org/web/20220216140431/https://hntokindl...[1] https://github.com/abishekmuthian/hntoebook"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Hi DanielFirst, I love what you&#39;ve done here, and why - congratulations on making it this far!A few suggestions:1) An independent web route is important, but you could lower the friction even further with browser plugins.  Like you, for general articles I use push-to-kindle[0] which only needs two clicks - no copy/paste, etc.2) Have you also thought about including a copy of the original article  - so that in a single download, there&#39;s the article followed by the HN discussion, all accessible from the document&#39;s index?3) I could see this developing further as a productivity tool via subscription - maybe I set up an account with you and then receive a digest of the day&#39;s top-10 (or 20, whatever) articles and discussions.  Or a weekly digest? Might be a powerful way to divert people away from the regular distraction of HN, but still allow consumption.Good luck :)[0] https://www.fivefilters.org/push-to-kindle/"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;m in a similar situation as as you in that I wear glasses and have busted right eye due to eye muscle surgery in the early 1980s.  I can &#34;see&#34; out of it but reading text is impossible unless it&#39;s like a foot tall.  The thought of avoiding screens never occurred to me.  Wouldn&#39;t any medium be it a screen, paper book, or Kindle cause eye strain on your left eye?  I&#39;ve seen many optometrists/ophthalmologists over the years and nobody recommended to avoid screens.  One doctor advised me to avoid using contacts since eyeglasses always give you eye protection for the left eye and that was it."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"If that idea of your lifetime not being enough is stressing you out, Dr David Burns&#39; work on cognitive behavioural therapy might help. Saying you want to be an expert in many things because you are interested in many things could be papering over some deeper anxiety-driven motivations around &#39;not being good enough&#39; or &#39;not being worthy of respect&#39; or &#39;needing to prove yourself to someone&#39; or &#39;not wanting to be a nobody&#39; or &#39;wanting to avoid the bullying you used to get&#39; or etc. The Feeling Good podcast[1] is a good audio introduction and has many examples, his book Feeling Great is more of a self-help style written introduction.The important question is not &#34;what should I work on?&#34; or &#34;how should I decide and prioritise?&#34;, it is something more like &#34;I have thought processes, they model imaginary futures and guide me away from predicted harm. Why do I have an imaginary future of not being enough of an expert and feel suffering in the present? Where did that thought come from and what is it doing for me, and do I want to keep it?&#34;.You can go with the desire for expertise part, &#34;why do I need to be an expert in many things?&#34; - whose respect are you trying to earn? Whose criticism are you trying to avoid? Who are you trying to avoid being like? What emotional disaster is that trying to protect you from? Or the other side, &#34;what is so bad if I am not an expert in many things on my deathbed?&#34;, what&#39;s imagined social or emotional harm is that warning me of?[1] https://feelinggood.com/list-of-feeling-good-podcasts/"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I let my natural curiosity guide me. I used to beat myself up about not being one of those people who have a singular purpose, someone who focuses deeply in one area, but found solace in Susan Fowler&#39;s blog post:&#34;All of the really great people of the past and of the present always have some singular destiny. Somehow they know exactly what they love, they find it when they&#39;re young, and they spend their entire lives doing that one thing. Their destiny, their singular passion becomes their entire life, and they love every minute of it. It&#39;s their calling, it&#39;s what they were born to do, and it&#39;s beautiful.&#34;...&#34;People tell me I can&#39;t do all the things I want to do, and they are of course wrong, because I can and I do and I will. But I still can&#39;t ever reach my greatest, deepest, most secret goal, the goal I left off that list: to have a singular passion. Maybe that&#39;s ok. Maybe my life will always be about running toward that unattainable goal, trying and loving everything I find along the way. And maybe at the end, when I have to give an account of my life, I&#39;ll say that I never was anything, but I was everything.&#34;Source: https://www.susanjfowler.com/blog/2017/5/21/life-without-a-d..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Four Thousand Weeks is a good book that touches on this. It begins with the premise that most people have infinite desires, and all people have finite time, and it&#39;s unlikely you will accomplish even 1% of all of your dreams in your finite life. It then talks about how that&#39;s okay, because what we choose to spend our time and attention on is what makes us unique and interesting, and explores some ways to prioritize the things that are most important to youm so that you actually do those things."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I do a small trick that seems to work wonders (at least for me).I don&#39;t limit myself at all. When I want to do any activity that seems to be dopamine-fuelling (emails, HN, Reddit, Stripe, other metrics, even company Intercom), I just have to set a timer to certain duration. I can reset, snooze, or extend durations however I want. No rules. Just the action of setting a timer.Oddly it has made myself way more conscious and intentional. Resulting in almost no actual distractions when I do want to focus. Technical tricks (blocking apps, websites, or DNS) are unfortunately too gimmicky because it&#39;s so easy to bypass. And personally I had no results with those."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"It&#39;s worth remembering that what works for John Carmack may not work for you.You may have more distractions in life or job that you cannot get rid of.Your baseline innate ability to focus may be very different.You may have less experience training the skills required to focus.Watching how successful people do things can provide useful inspiration for things to try, but you have to apply your own critical thinking and find what works for you."</p>

License the source explicitly for non commercial use only, then offer a commercial use licensed product (plus support, usually) for a fee. If there is a big community of hobbyists in the relevant field who do the same thing in their dayjob, I think this works well.Edit: A more open source version of this is to GPL the source and offer a more commercial friendly licensed product for a fee. I don&#39;t know if this technically goes against GPL but I have seen people do this.Edit: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multi-licensing"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I have a concept sitting in &lt;that folder with all the ideas&gt; that is pretty high on my list of &#34;man, I want to make this happen&#34; but would need a team to execute on.The idea is to integrate the kickstarter model with github&#39;s issues (specifically, feature requests).  You run an open-source project and people can submit feature requests that come with a fundraising campaign.When someone wants the software to do something new (support a new platform, implement an interface, etc) they draft a campaign a la kickstarter, someone who can contribute to the project negotiates with the drafter pricing, targets, and stretch goals.Past this point, it&#39;s the drafter&#39;s responsibility to do the marketing for the campaign and raise funds.  Once the target $ amount is hit, it&#39;s on the person who picked up the contract to get the work done.There are, of course, a ton of details to work out, and executing on this is going to be resource-intense on a number of vectors that aren&#39;t necessarily technical (legal, finance, hosting costs).  Also, I suck at UI.  The business itself would naturally be a non-profit.addendum:  I also have a day job that I have no intention of leaving, so factor that in to time-to-completion."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The chart is interesting because it misses the important part - it covers time, but not adoption.For example, adoption of GIMP has not likely materially increased over time (as a relative percent of total addressable market)IMHO, what the author gets wrong what so many people who claim this (they are not the first, or the last) get wrong - open source as a whole sucks at building products, but is great at building infrastructure.
(and pretty good at infrastructure products).If you go look at areas where an open source thing is a de-facto market-leader, they are mostly infrastructure.  Not all, but the ones that aren&#39;t have clear product management of some sort.That is - the good open source products are often built/driven either by extremely product focused people (This is rare), or by companies driving them with PMs.Not that the engineering doesn&#39;t matter - of course it does, but if you want a good and successful product, engineering is just a part of what is needed.  Sometimes not even the main part!Open source focuses mainly on the engineering part, often creating technical meritocracies that focus on making &#34;The technically best software&#34;.This is totally cool, but also totally orthogonal to building &#34;a good product that people want to use&#34;.Secondarily, you have the issue of survival in marketplace (IE There are a rash of OSS companies achieving near 100% of total addressable market share, and still going bankrupt due to inability to monetize).  This, however, is not as big an issue as the first (as people can always still pick it all up when that happens)Open source could always get better at products, but its historical development models were geared towards exactly the above (IE it does what it says on the tin)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt;All software will be open source, and no one will make money with software.I&#39;m really not convinced. The chart shows Photoshop having an alternative in with GIMP in 1998. And 24 years later, people are still paying lots of money for Photoshop. Pretty much all of these examples are similar. Yes open source has replaced some categories of paid software like VCS, but in a way it just opened up more paid software in the form of hosts and surrounding tooling like Github and paid git guis.If anything I think we have moved backwards. We are no longer looking at making copies of grep and dd. If you want to make an actual alternative to Photoshop you&#39;ll need thousands of workers spread over a lot of skill sets. You need cloud technology specialists, AI/ML experts, R&amp;D, design experts to do real studies and interviews with users, etc. You need teams of people working on out there new and untested ideas pushing the state of the art for image editing. While the alternatives are still trying to catch up to 2015 UI design patterns."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; all software will be open sourceThere&#39;s a heck of a lot of &#34;boring business software&#34; out there, often quite niche, solving problems various businesses have. Anything that survives, just by virtue it has survived, has a positive ROI for everyone involved, including the customer.Where is the supposed alternative going to come from?Are people being paid to write that software suddenly going to stop and go build it for free? Are there random people that will suddenly develop an interest in figuring out how to automate filling out a bunch of Mississippi state government permit request forms, or how to convert an obsolete file format that&#39;s only used in the gas industry to another obsolete file format and FTP it somewhere, or how to convert customer orders to a cut lists used by a multi-million dollar industrial machine of which less than 100 exist in the world?Are the customers (businesses) going to suddenly decide to hire up an engineering team and build this themselves, at probably higher cost than they pay today and definitely at way higher risk? Maybe they&#39;ll get together with a bunch of businesses with similar needs -- aka their competitors -- and pool their resources to build something?I think none of this will happen -- or will happen in such exceedingly rare circumstances it&#39;s not worth considering.Which means I&#39;m pretty confident to say there will always be proprietary software."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Something I learned not long ago on this site: low quality/too long HDMI cables can make some monitors go black when the user stands or sits on a certain kind of office chair. [1] [2]Apparently it&#39;s a known issue at Dell: [3]&gt;Surprisingly, we have also seen this issue connected to gas lift office chairs. When people stand or sit on gas lift chairs, they can generate an EMI spike which is picked up on the video cables, causing a loss of sync. If you have users complaining about displays randomly flickering it could actually be connected to people sitting on gas lift chairs. Again swapping video cables, especially for ones with magnetic ferrite ring on the cable, can eliminate this problem. There is even a white paper about this issue.[1] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voW5kEI7JKE[2] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6pY4t0k1hk[3] https://support.displaylink.com/knowledgebase/articles/73861..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I have a lot of respect for this developer’s patience. Back when I was a solo developer, these types of issues were death by a thousand paper cuts. I didn’t have the skills to deal with the amount of support and debugging these kinds of problems entail. And it’s especially frustrating when the answer ends up being “It’s due to how the manufacturer of this monitor just didn’t properly implement the spec and there’s nothing I can do to fix it.” I can’t imagine writing software where this is the norm! So kudos to the developer!"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The first issue, where multiple monitors have the same vendor/model/manufacture date/serial number, couldn&#39;t that be solved by also storing which port it&#39;s connected to? That way, if you have two HDMI ports, if both monitors have the same UUID, you store settings based on port rather than UUID. I don&#39;t know if this is possible with this new USB-C world, but at least with traditional hardware, it seems like the OS knows which port a monitor is connected to.Anyways, interesting post. It&#39;s always fun to discover how much hardware is just broken and doesn&#39;t actually correctly implement the protocols or features it&#39;s supposed to implement."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Saw this really amazing video[0] the other day about American Chestnut Foundation&#39;s breeding program in Virginia to revive the American chestnutBasically they hybridized it with Chinese/Japanese chestnuts (which are blight resistant). Then they take the offspring, test for blight resistance and rebreed those back with purebred American chestnuts. Then they repeat the process. Take those offspring, select for blight resistance, rebreed with American species, etcAfter a few generations they created an American chestnut tree that looks almost exactly like the purebred versions but retains the blight resistance of the Japanese and Chinese speciesReally amazing work[0] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbrY-J0bpto"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Cool to see this here and people talking about it. I volunteered with the American Chestnut Foundation during my summers in high school. Usually spent a few weeks on the Meadowview research farm collecting catkins off trees, “processing” the catkins to bottle the pollen, bagging trees to prevent uncontrolled cross pollination, and pollinating trees by hand.My uncle and I also usually took hikes in NC to try and find remaining trees with pollen in the wild. From what I understand, the pollen from these few remaining living trees is used to help re-introduce regional biodiversity into the backcrossed American/Chinese hybrids.Highly recommend going and helping out on the farm if you can spare a week or two, or joining your state chapter if you’ve got one - or sending your kids!"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The paradox is that you can&#39;t create a theory of music whose notes are both (a) evenly spaced and (b) contain the integer ratios.You want (a) because it you gives you nice algebraic properties (the music structure is invariant under frequency shifts). You want (b) because small-integer ratios are pleasant sounding -- partly culturally-acquired taste, partly because physics gives musical instruments acoustic spectra in integral multiples of a fundamental frequency: f, 2f, 3f ... nf. Small-integer ratios are naturally occurring and very recognizable.Modern tuning (C-f &#34;12-TET&#34; in the article) almost, approximately satisfies (a) and (b) simultaneously. &#34;12&#34; means there&#39;s twelve tones between f and 2f; the ratio between adjacent tones is defined to be 2^{1/12}. This tuning can&#39;t contain both f and 3f (so it fails (b)), but it *can* contain f and 2^{19/12}f ~ 2.9966f, which is actually close enough to 3f to be indistinguishable. (Almost works!) But as you build ratios out of larger integers, it audibly falls apart. The closest you can get to (5/3)f is 2^{9/12}f = ~1.6818f, which is already 10% of the way to the next note. And it rapidly gets worse.This is why two on-paper-identical notes can end up audibly different, depending on what key you&#39;re starting with (and hence how they are approached). There&#39;s tension internal to music theory itself."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The explanation of enharmonic equivalent (though the author didn&#39;t use this term) is right, but I do take problem with this sentence:&gt; but what musical difference does it make? In the present day, the answer is, none whatsoever.This is not quite right. On all fretless instruments, including most bowed strings and the human voice, enharmonic equivalent notes still have different pitches. The subtle differences in intonation is incredibly important and noticeable on the violin, for example."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"My thought is, if you peel back the first layer of music theory, you discover a chaotic, lawless world. The main thing I&#39;ve noticed is that this is extremely unnerving to engineers, who want to learn it as a precise hierarchical structure. Regular people are more focused on the fact that somebody is somehow making it all sound good, and want to learn how to do that.On the other hand, most musicians are completely ambivalent to it, or even thrive in the chaos. Yet the &#34;rules&#34; are useful because they provide a common ground for forming ensembles, or connecting composer and performer. We&#39;ve watched musicians go down the rabbit hole of nonstandard scales, innovative notation systems, etc., only to discover that nobody can play their material.I&#39;m a double bassist. I&#39;m happy just to be able to coordinate my ears, brain, and hands, well enough to play the same note the same way twice if I want to. Claiming that I have conscious control over temperament would be laughable. I&#39;ve got too much other stuff to think about: The notes on the page, the non-notated passages (many jazz bass parts are expected to be improvised), tempo and rhythm, connecting with the rest of the band and the audience, who&#39;s coming in the front door, and so forth. This stuff is all happening in real time."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This is the great fear of many come to pass - censorship by algorithm. Facebook didn&#39;t outright ban sharing of the Hunter Biden laptop stories like Twitter did, they instead tweaked their algorithm to prevent the story from spreading. We found out about it this time because Zuckerberg owned up to it, but what about next time? For all we know, Facebook, Google and Twitter are doing this right now on a range of other subjects.It&#39;s scary to think that just 2 to 3 corporations have the power to construct a false reality around us, in a way that&#39;s virtually impossible for us to detect."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"So let me get this straight.Facebook has absolute control to limit the spread of a story or news on their platform.Facebook has absolute control to outright block specific content based on an algorithm they control.Facebook can and will editorialize content posted on their platform.Facebook has absolute control over the content that users see.Can someone, anyone, please explain to me why Facebook is not a publisher? Why should Facebook continue to receive Section 230 protections? They are gatekeeper, publisher, and editor."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I found interesting how during the podcast, Zuckerberg compared the suppression of the story to due process in the justice system. A snippet from the podcast (with minor edits, starting from 7:25 of this video clip [1]):&gt; Joe Rogan: is there regret for not having it evenly distributed and for throttling the distribution of that story?&gt; [...]&gt; Zuckerberg: yeah yeah I mean it sucks because I mean it turned out after the fact...I mean the fact directors looked into it no one was able to say it was false right. So basically it had this period where it was getting less distribution&gt; it sucks though I think in the same way that probably having to go through like a criminal trial but being proven innocent in the end sucks. Like it still sucks that you had to go through a criminal trial but at the end you&#39;re free&gt; I don&#39;t know if the answer would have been don&#39;t do anything or don&#39;t have any process. I think the process was pretty reasonable you know. We still let people share it. But obviously you don&#39;t want situations like that[1]: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BN3PIGLDscQ"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Banning Delta altogether seems disproportionate. Banning all 767s would be silly. Telling Delta they can’t fly this one particular plane to Accra seems to me like a perfectly reasonable response to a run of incidents involving that plane within a short period of time.Honestly, the only thing that  surprises me about this is that other aviation authorities haven’t followed suit."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Between 2010 and 2013, I used to fly to Ghana most summers. Delta would use old aircraft on this route. Inflight entertainment was the screen hanging in the middle of the aisle. Watching a movie on the flight was a challenge. You had to bring your own entertainment to pass the time.Eventually I stopped using that route and took KLM instead. KLM to Schiphol and to Accra. KLM was in a world of it&#39;s own. Similar planes irrespective of whether I was in the US or flying to Ghana. Personal inflight entertainment. The service was way better."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I kind of agree with Ghana here. Gotta maintain your planes. It&#39;s sad that a foreign country has to be the one making Delta do routine pmc."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Not exactly connected but the same crowd interested in this topic may also be interested in this tool to store SSH private keys in the Secure Enclave, kind of like what can be done with a YubiKey:https://github.com/maxgoedjen/secretiveI&#39;ve been looking for something like this for 3-4 years but only found it six months ago (in an HN thread).  I use separate keys for every use case, and now know every time a key is used for any purpose, whether it&#39;s connecting to source control or my text editor is connecting to a remote VM.Only thing I haven&#39;t figured out is how to do git signatures with these sorts of keys, but I haven&#39;t debugged it at all."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I know PAM gets criticized here and there, sometimes heavily, but it&#39;s actually a super flexible system.  The thing that really stands out is that no application actually needs to know about all the various authentication methods possible.  That file in /etc/pam.d/ just corresponds to the app&#39;s &#34;service name&#34;, and you (as the machine administrator) can put in it whatever you want.  The app just needs to go &#34;Hey PAM, I want to start authentication using service &#39;sudo&#39;&#34;, and then PAM will send instructions to the app, like &#34;Display the text &#39;Place your finger on the fingerprint scanner&#39;&#34;, or &#34;Display the text &#39;Password:&#39; and then prompt for masked input&#34;.It&#39;s really quite flexible, and despite its age, still works pretty well with current programming paradigms, whether your UI is text or graphical or whatever.  The one oddity is that when it asks you to prompt for some kind of user input, it will actually expect you to return the resulting input from the same callback function.  So if you&#39;re using a modern-ish GUI toolkit, you&#39;ll need to run the PAM stuff off on a different thread that&#39;s allowed to block while your UI thread is free to do what it needs to do.  But overall that&#39;s just... fine?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;ve also done this on my Framework laptop running Linux, it&#39;s really convenient. Have it set up for sudo, user login, etc. Just added this to various files in /etc/pam.d  auth sufficient pam_fprintd.so"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; &#34;We hope to publish guides about more complex use cases (lending, insurance, etc.) in the future.&#34;That would be appreciated.  It&#39;d be nice to see the minimal complexity needed for something like a local credit union that managed customer savings and checking accounts, as well as home and car loans.More ambitious would be a central banking app, in particular how does double-entry accounting work when a central bank (i.e. the Fed) is doing &#39;quantitative easing&#39; and using their helicopter money to buy up Treasury bonds and mortgage-backed securities in order to keep major banks and government solvent?  What&#39;s the private bank&#39;s balance sheet look like when they use the central bank money for stock buy-backs instead of for increasing commercial lending?For example, the Fed says it&#39;s unloading the mortgage-backed securities it bought up in 2008-2009.  That&#39;s got to be some convoluted accounting:https://www.marketplace.org/2022/06/02/why-the-federal-reser..."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"People should understand this:A free tier is a loss-leader, intended to support sales of the paid product.If too many “…have been happily using Slack’s free plan for years”, then Slack will have to change the terms.Generally, storage and access to storage cost money. If you aren’t paying for it, it is definitely temporary, whether anyone says it explicitly or not. I don’t just mean in a “nothing lasts forever” way, but that it will gone in the relatively short term. This is just reality."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"It&#39;s interesting (and sad) how the forums of yesteryear have essentially gone away entirely, with no good solutions popping up to replace them. I know they were/are incredibly prone to security issues, but they were good at one thing and one thing only: community.I recall spending a crazy amount of time refreshing the index on a site called TradeGamesNow (and to a lesser degree CheapAssGamer) waiting for new posts/comments. Now every site on the web either has a Subreddit (too much tertiary noise), Discord (I&#39;m terrified of making a post on the wrong server by accident), or (to a lesser degree) Slack (limited features, as noted in the article).As to the Slack announcement: I get that guests staying in your house for free eat not-free food. That being said, I have to imagine that Slack could offer a non-real-time updating experience (no polling, disable calls/video/file hosting) to cut down on costs (my assumption is that the active nature of the service is the biggest expense) and make it feasible for a free or $5/mo for X users &amp; unlimited guests.(I&#39;m aware that Discourse was Supposed To Be The Chosen One, but at $100/mo and no self-hosting option (that I can see), I don&#39;t think it&#39;s even considered much. But I could be wrong.)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;m grateful to Slack for their changes in the free plan, it forced our hands.We realized it&#39;s obvious we can&#39;t trust any of these external SaaS services, in the long run they will ALWAYS change the terms and somehow fuck the customers, paying or not. And then you will lose all the invaluable information and data that belongs to you. This has happened with other services we&#39;ve used in the past too.So we decided to just start self-hosting our own private intranet. I&#39;ve installed gitea, NextCloud, a private irc server (we&#39;re old school irssi users and love it, shoutout for thelounge -client too), a private social network site with Wordpress and Buddypress+BBpress with our own theme, among other things. Everything was super simple to setup and is trivial to maintain, works well across devices without any limitations. We control everything and don&#39;t have to worry about the big brother snooping our data. Along with these came many new business opportunities. So yeah, thanks slack."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I want more costcos.To people who don&#39;t know, part of the core of Costco&#39;s business model is curation, which leads to customer trust.  I know that almost any product that I buy at costco is going to be high quality.  I know that anything with a kirkland brand on it is going to be so high quality and so cheap that it feels like I found a cheat.What&#39;s funny about costco is that their in store experience is so good that they have seemingly ignored any sort of online presence.  Yeah they have a website, but it doesn&#39;t seem to actually have a comprehensive list of everything they sell.  You have to go to the store and check out what they have (and get a hot dog or a piece of pizza while you&#39;re there)If there was a delivery app that curated restaurants, I would absolutely love it, and I also think it would be really successful."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I mean, why not?Companies like Unilever have been doing this for far longer than anyone in the restaurant space. Churn out thousands of brands that supposedly &#34;compete&#34; with each other in the marketplace. If one of those brands has a reputation problem, shut it down and replace it. Rinse and repeat.If the practice is distasteful, then change the law, but beware the lobbyists."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I just can&#39;t believe that aggregator sites would be gamed by bad actors... Shocked, I tell you.Also, on all of these delivery services I desperately just want a &#34;no cloud kitchens&#34; option. I want to support local businesses — actual restaurants. It&#39;s annoying having to research any new place I want to try to make sure it&#39;s not operated out of the back side of some warehouse.(Also: &#34;Curate,&#34; don&#39;t aggregate. It&#39;s a little more expensive and requires actual knowledge, which is why no one wants to do it. But then you actually become a service people can trust.)"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I feel the need to defend Finnish cases. Yes, they have a gazillion, but unlike other languages you might know (eg Latin or German), there’s nothing difficult about Finnish cases.Most cases are simply used where English would use prepositions. In Finnish those are postfixes instead, a bunch of letters tacked onto the end of a word. It’s a case and not a word because there’s no space between the two, that’s it.Eg “talo” means house. Talossa means “in the house”. Talon means “of the house” (actually, “the house’s” - omg English has cases too, super difficult). Talolla means “on (top of) the house”. That’s not harder than prepositions is it?I did cheat a bit, because with some words you first got to find the root before you can tack on “-ssa”. The root of talo is also talo, but for some words you got to apply a (simple, purely letter-based) rule. Eg the root of “ankka” (duck) is “anka” so “the duck’s house” becomes “ankan talo”. There’s a bunch of rules to find the root of a noun and you can learn them in half an hour or so.There’s plenty stuff that’s harder about Finnish (notably the vocabulary), but the cases are peanuts."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"It should be Japanese, of course!Japanese can be written using either the Latin alphabet, or Chinese characters.  The two most common writing systems in the world.  It can also be written with its own elegant and purely phonetic writing system.  There&#39;s even Braille, Morse code, and sign language encodings.  It is truly media agnostic.Japanese has a regular grammar.  From a linguist&#39;s perspective, aside from the politeness system, it&#39;s really quite normal for a language.  Very little in it to surprise a Finnish, Turkish or Korean speaker.   (Unlike English, which if first discovered today spoken by a people in the interior of New Guinea, would lead to accusations of a linguistic hoax.)Finally, some 40% of Japanese vocabulary is based on Chinese, and Chinese and Japanese technical terms flow freely between the languages to this day.  Another ~20% of Japanese vocabulary is borrowed from European languages like English or Portuguese.  The majority of the world already speaks a significant amount of Japanese and they don&#39;t even know it!  For this reason, Chinese, European, and American, alike, usually find it quite easy to learn."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"You got me until the first point&#34;It is an essentially logical language. The rules are absolute and reliable in all situations, except exceptions.&#34;&#34;except exceptions?!&#34; whoa..! the brought back memories from learning German.perkele!"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I&#39;ve seen so much anti-car, pro-walkability, pro-transit, pro-bikeability sentiment online recently.I really hope this is proof of the younger generations -- Millenials, Zoomers, and younger folks even -- waking up to the idea that the USA in particular has become a toxic environment thanks to cars. WFH was a big wakeup call, I think -- once you step away from the commute for a year or two, trying to sit in traffic again seems insane. I guess it&#39;s a successful &#34;unboiling of the frog,&#34; where we realized that car infratructure has been turned up for the last century to unbearable levels.I hate cars. I don&#39;t want to use them on a daily basis. I&#39;m cheap, and I don&#39;t want to own one, or maintain one. I try to do everything I can by biking or walking, or transit if those aren&#39;t feasible. It is nearly impossible in 95% of the USA.Selfishly, I really want the USA to bring city centers back to livable levels by banning most cars and redesigning them for humans. Otherwise I&#39;m absolutely going to end up moving to Europe eventually -- likely the Netherlands -- because driving a car is just so unpleasant for me. I&#39;d rather not learn a whole new language and leave my family and friends so far behind, but especially since covid I&#39;ve come to realize that driving makes me miserable, and I need other ways to get from my home into the world."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I love the car and car culture. I&#39;ve road tripped across the U.S. and live in an RV. I will never go back to living in an apartment. There&#39;s no human connection there. I spent years living in apartments and maybe met one or two people, with no meaningful connections ever developed. Cars are great for road tripping, and America is highly optimized for it. You can, with the same vehicle, without unpacking once, travel from the Atlantic ocean to the Pacific ocean in a matter of days. You can visit the mountains, beaches, camp in hundreds of national and state parks (for cheap or free).In Florida, some of my fondest memories was jumping into two cars with my teenage friends and riding out the one hour drive to Daytona, where we&#39;d drive our car literally on the beach and then plop down right next to it, sneaking sips of Natural Light that we illegally smuggled there between sessions of football and boogey boarding. Then we&#39;d get back in the car and be back before curfew.All of our vacations were to the Smokey Mountains, a mere 9 hour drive from central Florida. Dad would drive overnight in our minivan while us kids slept in the back seats. We&#39;d pull up to a cabin first thing in the morning and excitedly rush to our claim our beds for the few days we&#39;d be staying there. Despite sleeping a little rough in the car, we were more than energized by the newness of the locale and the existence of elevation we were quite unfamiliar with back home on the relatively flat peninsula, and we&#39;d proceed to hike the woods around the cabin to survey the land.Plenty of human and natural connection is to be had with your own vehicle in America. And I wouldn&#39;t have it any other way."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I always thought it was strange when people would say &#34;The automobile represent freedom&#34;. I grew up in a &#34;streetcar suburb&#34; and later moved to a big city. So for me, cars were always viewed as an expensive annoyance you might need depending on your life circumstances, but certainly not something you&#39;d go out of your way to buy unless you needed it.But as I got older and lived briefly in a suburb of Houston TX it finally clicked: the way so many subdivisions are planned you are quite literally trapped inside your subdivision unless you have a vehicle. Need to buy groceries? Get to school? Go hang out with friends? You need a car. You aren&#39;t heading anywhere interesting without one.So I get why people have a romanic idea of the automobile, but that romance is a side-effect of poor urban planning."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"At a company I worked for we had a strong incentive program to submit patent applications for our work, where each listed inventor would receive a monetary payment of ~$2-3k if the patent was deemed worthy and filed by our lawyers, and an additional bonus if it was granted some years later.The problem is the patent applications would flood in from employees with the hopes that the non-technical lawyers would miss some due diligence like finding prior art. Worst case is you wasted a bit of time on the application, best case is you just made an easy $3k.Now the company was not a patent troll, so I don&#39;t recall hearing about any instances of them actually suing anyone over patents. But it still opened my eyes to how ridiculous the software patent process really is. You don&#39;t have to create anything, write any code, or even be the brightest engineer with a unique idea. You just need to get that idea past enough people. The entire industry is a scam for money, no matter which end of it you&#39;re on."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&gt; Or, maybe this is just a new “fad” for juvenile orcas that could go out of fashion as they grow up, Jared Towers, director of Canadian research organization Bay Cetology, tells NPR. In the 1990s, scientists observed another strange orca trend, but it has since faded away.&gt; &#34;They&#39;d kill fish and just swim around with this fish on their head,&#34; Towers tells NPR. &#34;We just don&#39;t see that anymore.”Imagining the behavioral / fashion trends of Orcas over time is really fascinating :D"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The article mentions it. One of the most mind-blowing facts is that there has never been a recorded human death caused by an Orca.There are many possible explanations for it, selective eaters, not tasty, knowing what they are getting themselves into.At the same time they are curious, playful, and it seems emotional, if they have trends like breaking boats &amp; carrying dead fish. It&#39;s a miracle such playfulness never ever accidentally killed a human.After Sperm whales they have the largest brains in the world. Of course big sections of that is dedicated to their complicated bodily functions. But I think we are most likely severely underestimating their intelligence.Edit: &#34;a recorded human death in the wild&#34;"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"There is at least one well-documented case of a pod of orcas understanding enough about people and boats for them to to initiate a mutually-beneficial and reciprocal understanding of how to cooperate in hunting whales.https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Killer_whales_of_Eden,_New_Sou...Given this, I think it is conceivable that these orcas may have achieved some sort of understanding of fishing boats as competing with them for their food, and developed a hostility towards boats as a result.IIRC, not all orca pods hunt whales or other marine mammals, and many are generally fish eaters. I would not be at all comfortable in a life raft or similar boat in the presence of orcas that do hunt seals or emperor penguins."</p>

You&#39;d think there would be some login verification to prevent just anyone from using that link, but no, anyone that has this link, can now deactivate your email alias. The password itself is formatted in json, compressed with deflate, and simply tacked on to the end of the link&#39;s URL. When you click on the link, the destination webpage takes the end of the URL, decompresses the deflate, and serves a deactivate button to deactivate the email alias. When you click on that button, the email alias&#39;s address and password are sent to DDG&#39;s API and your email alias is disabled."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I have always had an introverted nature. As a child, I would immerse myself for hours reading a book or other solitary activity. When my parents sent me to my room for punishment, they found it didn&#39;t work as I would not be begging to come out.But at different times of my life, I have been quite active socially. My college years especially were filled with social interactions that I grew to enjoy. It started out as friends and roommates dragging me to one thing or another, but after a while I instigated a lot of it.But I naturally gravitated to a career in programming where I can spend 10 hours straight at the keyboard with almost no interaction. My hobby project is a major one that deals with a whole new way to manage data. It has consumed several years of my life as I spend a great deal of my &#39;free time&#39; thinking about it, writing code, or optimizing something.My introverted nature has affected my family life as I withdraw into my own little world. My wife sometimes wonders if I am depressed, unhappy, or stressed. Although I am perfectly content, I have to force myself to come out of my shell and interact much more with the wife and kids (and friends and neighbors). Many of my fellow programmers that I have worked with over the years also exhibit some of these tendencies.I guess it is debatable whether this adds to or subtracts from actual creativity."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"It’s kind of easy to take this extremely literally and pick it apart, which a lot of comments here are doing, but might be helpful to broaden what “solitude” means and maybe even read it as though it’s a bit allegorical. Also important to remember this was more than 100 years ago, and that he’s talking very specifically about how to write poetry. All the way through I felt like he could have been talking about social media.Metaphorically, he seems to be saying (to me even more strongly than isolation): that motivation needs to be intrinsic, it should come from yourself and your own desires, not from others; and that you should practice your craft intensely and make sure the practice of writing poetry is free from interruptions or noise that cloud things. He may be naming the state of flow we all want using words for it that we’re not used to these days, along with a push for writers to set their own standards and not judge themselves by publishing metrics. These are fairly timeless and applicable ideas today, not to mention all of us programmers frequently dream of solitude and perhaps resent the fact that we almost never get it at work."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; Humans are fundamentally solitary. That is our natureAmazing, every word of what that guy said is wrong.Maybe he was actually talking about cats, that would make sense. But humans literally can&#39;t function outside of a society."</p>

NIST/NSF funded several studies that I was close to that were suddenly owned by a journal who did nothing but provide a place to put it.Public money should always mean public access.

								<p class="story__comment_others">"That&#39;s only doable with a text-centric website. I&#39;m currently finishing a photography section for my personal website, and the gallery pages are several hundred kBs in size, while single photo page is almost 1MB in size (provided you load it on a 28&#34; screen; browser will load smaller variants on smaller screens). Most of that weight is the thumbnails (and almost-full-size photo in the latter case). The only JS I have is 6 lines (before minifying) on single photo pages which allow you to go to next or previous photo with keyboard arrows. I don&#39;t use any CSS frameworks, just a single hand-written CSS file. I don&#39;t have any tracking, analytics, social media features or anything of this sort.So if even a personal site being done with no deadlines, no pressure from management to include analytics etc. can&#39;t do it, because it wants to display a bunch of photos, then I don&#39;t think we can expect &#34;web-scale&#34; websites to achieve it."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I wonder if anyone has studied the impact of latency on user behavior while considering the impact of user expectations from their typical connection speed. Whenever I see an article about page speed optimization, the assumption is that a user will give up if a page takes too long to load, ans that everyone gives up after X seconds. Usually X is about 7s based on a Nielson article from years and years ago.The thing is tbough, a user who frequently uses satellite Internet or a 2G mobile connection will learn that pages take a while to download over that connection, and they will adjust their expectations accordingly. Satellite Internet users aren&#39;t giving up on pages every 7s. They&#39;re waiting because they know the page will load slowly.I suspect most users wait for a page if most pages are slow. So long as your website is no slower than the average then you&#39;re probably not losing many visitors.Obviously that&#39;s not to say you shouldn&#39;t make your website as fast as you can. You should. Everyone will appreciate the effort. But don&#39;t assume that knocking a few seconds off the TTI time will actually impact your conversion metrics. It probably won&#39;t (but only a proper study can prove it either way)."</p>

Pricing changes are always hard, and having been through some of the earlier pricing changes at Heroku you can&#39;t make everyone happy. But, so many developers deployed their first app on Heroku and was a staple for so many bootcamps. Without it I&#39;m confident we&#39;d have less developers in the world.It is still one of the gold standards for developer experience. Years after its heyday companies and tools talk about and try to emulate that experience. I recall polling on twitter a few months back which the key feature was:- git push heroku master- Heroku add-ons- Heroku Postgres- Review appsAnd the reality is any one of those could standard on their own. But put together, Heroku simply lets you forget about ops and focus on shipping, and shipping is king.I fully get it&#39;s a business, but can&#39;t help but feel this is the writing on the wall for the future.Gonna pour one out tonight for Heroku.Edit: And may be trying to figure out how to offer free Postgres databases, cause shutting down databases with 3 months notice feels pretty short.

								<p class="story__comment_others">"We pay Heroku many, many tens of thousands of dollars a year. And I still use free dynos, both personally and at work. For example, throwing up a quick app for testing (where I&#39;m happy with dynos that sleep or are limited per-repo). By pushing us off the Heroku ecosystem for some stuff, we might as well just move everything.The only reason we even use Heroku now is because I used it for free over a decade ago.I get why they made this decision, and I&#39;m excited for Fly.io, Render, etc who can run the same playbook Heroku did 15 years ago. But also a bit sad, from a nostalgic standpoint. Many of us are here because of Heroku&#39;s free tier, and I&#39;m very thankful for it."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Fly.io has a dedicated process for moving off of Heroku. Auth via Heroku and they&#39;ll launch your app onto Fly. They also have a free tier.The process: https://fly.io/launch/herokuThe docs: https://fly.io/docs/app-guides/speed-up-a-heroku-appI haven&#39;t used it [the Heroku -&gt; Fly process] myself, but it&#39;s been around for quite some time!"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Looks really good. A layer over Nix that makes it tolerable sounds like a godsend. I’ve had a TODO item for “somehow use Nix for our dev env” at Notion since 2019, but I keep kicking the can down the road because its better to tolerate a 500 line setup script than learn all the Nix stuff. Of course we could use Docker, but then on Mac our dev process would be 3x slower.Congrats to Daniel and the team! Excited to see what’s next after this."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Having a deterministic environment, but that is actually running on your laptop is so much better than working inside a docker container. Inside a container the file system is very slow, and you lose all of your other tools and shell aliases."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is shelling out to nix-shell (https://github.com/jetpack-io/devbox/blob/97c19c370287e203bb...) which means that it will only support bash AFAIK. I&#39;ve seen a lot of discussions around using nix-shell for dev environments, but read somewhere that is not really made for this purpose originally, rather for just building packages, bash being only one of the limitations.I tried to experiment myself with nix-shell, but I think it doesn&#39;t provide separation on the machine on which you run, it&#39;s not a chroot nor a docker container. If you are interested in some level of separation to make sure that a dev environment is &#34;safe&#34; to run on your machine without making side effects to things external to the project, then I&#39;m not sure nix-shell would be able to help, but I would be happy to learn there is an option to do otherwise."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"This article engages in my pet peeve, which is referring to entertainment as &#34;content&#34;.I don&#39;t have a problem with the word &#34;content&#34; in the context of content vs framing.  e.g. if you are designing a network protocol, you care about distinguishing the content of the message from the framing, and you don&#39;t care at all what the nature of the content is, it could be video, image, text, etc, and it could serve many different purposes (entertainment, personal communication, employee training, archival/backup, etc).However, this sort of language has crept into discussions of online entertainment, for no good reason.  &#34;I&#39;m not an online entertainer, creating entertainment  for people to enjoy, I am a content-creator creating content for people to consume.&#34;  I think people don&#39;t like to think about what they&#39;re creating or consuming as entertainment, because society has already attached a connotation of triviality to the term &#34;entertainment&#34; (for good reason IMO).Someone who talks about &#34;content&#34; is adopting the terminology and framing of a businessman, who cares little what purpose the &#34;content&#34; serves, just that it can attract attention, and thus money.To be fair, once the internet is entirely taken over by bots, maybe it will be appropriate to call the stuff that bots create and consume &#34;content&#34; without a whiff of irony."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The end result of all this fakery is a growing doubt and distrust of the world and the information presented to us. Bots on twitter, corporate reddit moderators pruning discourse, astroturfed discussions, deepfakes, AI generated news articles, AI art, it all waters down the assumption that what we see before us is real. Leading us to doubt everything we read, see and hear. Much of this bot driven noise online is only possible in large, public online communities.I think we will see a shift towards much smaller walled gardens of community online. It&#39;s already happening with the mass exodus to discord and smaller chatrooms. I think we can all safely assume that our 30 discord friends are real people... for now.The country club exists for the wealthy to enjoy the pleasantries of community and pastime without interruption by the masses. I think the internet will move to mirror the real world as we segregate apart into the places we most enjoy... or have the connections and money to afford. Authentic and vibrant human communities with novel content curation will be a luxury, while the &#34;public pool&#34; for the masses will be an internet of data pollution and grime."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"There&#39;s another route to an industrial revolution that might have happened - steel.The British industrial revolution was built from iron, not steel. Mass production of steel didn&#39;t appear until the 1880s, with the Bessemer converter. This was half a century after the deployment of successful railroads.Iron and steel was known to the Roman empire. The steel wasn&#39;t very good, even by the standards of antiquity, but it was good enough for short swords and some tools. They got as far as the &#34;bloom&#34; process, but no further. Despite this, there was a modest iron and steel industry.A Bessemer converter is a simple thing. It&#39;s a big iron vessel lined with brick attached to a furnace and blower. Roman ironworkers could have built one. It&#39;s the metallurgy that&#39;s hard. Bessemer built the thing, but steel quality was random at first. Robert Mushet, a metallurgist, after about 10,000 experiments, figured out how to get consistent quality from the process. The basic idea, from Wikipedia, is to apply enough heat and air to burn off almost all the carbon in iron ore, leaving pure iron. Then add  &#39;spiegel glanz&#39; or spiegel eisen, a &#34;double carbonate of iron and manganese found in the Rhenish mountains&#34; which was iron, 86…25; manganese, 8…50; and carbon, 5…25.  Controlled amounts of manganese and carbon are thus put back into the molten iron, and steel comes out.A number of cultures figured out steel by accident. Thus, Japanese steel, Damascus steel, etc. 
Various trace additives - vanadium, molybdenum, etc. were used. The Roman empire got as far as mediocre steel. But the process was neither understood nor reproducible at scale. Mass production required enough analytical chemistry to do quality control on the ingredients.So an interesting speculation is what might have happened if an early culture had some people really into finding out what stuff is made of. That leads to analytical chemistry. Some Roman philosopher might have discovered that if you grind rocks to a powder, mix with water, and spray into a steady flame, colored light comes out. If you look at that colored light through a prism, you see sharp lines, in the same places for the same materials, which indicate the elemental composition of the material. If they&#39;d happened to talk to someone in the Roman army responsible for a sword factory having yield problems, they might have gotten some samples of the minerals being used. That might have led to the beginnings of metallurgy quality control. As there is in a modern steel plant, there would be somebody in a little room not too far from the furnaces doing analysis on the raw materials.Steel would still be somewhat expensive, but with a repeatable production process, swords and knives would get better. Then agricultural implements and other tools. If you need to plow hard or rocky ground, a steel plow is a big help.The next big breakthrough in an an agrarian society with some steelmaking capability would be a reaper. The McCormick reaper was the first machine that really boosted agricultural production. That&#39;s what kicked the world past sustenance-level agriculture.So that&#39;s an unlikely, but not impossible, alternative path to an industrial revolution."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The basic argument is that without a clear use case to overcome the version 1.0 troubles of (steam) engines, there was no incentive to work out the kinks and pumping water out of coal mines was the big &#34;killer application&#34; of such motors. That is, pumping water out of coal mines was the &#34;early adopter&#34; market for engine technology:&gt; As we’ll see, this was a use-case that didn’t really exist in the ancient world and indeed existed almost nowhere but Britain even in the period where it worked.I remember reading a blog post by TechnicsHistory [0] (which was on the front page of HN at one point) that makes the same argument.The acoup.blog article goes on to give a reason why coal wasn&#39;t needed earlier as the need for heating fuel became scarce when wood became scarce:&gt; Consequently wood as a heat fuel was scarce and so beginning in the 16th century we see a marked shift over to coal as a heating fuel for things like cooking and home heating.I&#39;m still skeptical of why it took so long. Were there no other places in Europe, Asia or the Middle East that didn&#39;t have the same deforestation issues? Was it the combination of deforestation and population density?[0] https://technicshistory.com/2021/07/13/the-triumvirate-coal-..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Great article. Thought provoking.Maybe an industrial revolution could not have happened in the times of the Romans, but I think maybe, just maybe, it could have happened 1000 years before them.The bronze age was followed by the iron age not because iron is a better metal (initially it was not), but because bronze requires trade routes (copper comes from some mines, tin from some other mines), and those disappeared after the Bronze Age collapse.Now, imagine that the Bronze Age had lasted a few hundred years longer. Just one hundred years before the Bronze Age collapse there was the battle of Kadesh [1], where tens of thousands of soldiers squared off. There were 5000 to 6000 chariots altogether.Which means the late Bronze Age empires needed huge quantities of weapons, therefore of bronze. Egypt does not have a lot of trees, and trees are quite scarce in other places in the Middle East. Just like Britain ran out of trees and needed to resort to coal, a few hundred years more of bronze age would have forced Egypt to look for a substitute for charcoal. It would not have been coal, because there are no easily accessible veins of coal in the Middle East.It would have been petroleum. Petroleum was known during those times [2]:  More than 4000 years ago, according to Herodotus and Diodorus Siculus, asphalt was used in the construction of the walls and towers of Babylon; there were oil pits near Ardericca (near Babylon), and a pitch spring on Zacynthus. Great quantities of it were found on the banks of the river Issus, one of the tributaries of the Euphrates.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I agree with the article in general, but the wrinkle comes when you encounter a bug in a large, popular open source project (naming no names, but any of the major web frameworks for example) that you&#39;re using for a work project.Fix it? Sure, except despite their ostensibly open nature, many of these projects are run as internal projects of large tech corps, and the bandwidth and interest of the team in reviewing and merging external PRs is limited to nonexistent. I&#39;ve submitted small, obvious bug fixes, complete with test coverage, to projects and had them sit unreviewed for years.Fork it? Well there is a big, big difference between spending an hour fixing a bug and submitting a PR, and forking a large and complex dependency. You&#39;re committing yourself and your team and employer to the ongoing maintenance of the fork and merging of upstream changes, just so you can merge a bug fix. Usually, that&#39;s just not practical.Fuck off? Many third-party dependencies in mature projects are non-negotiable. Removing them would require a complete rewrite. You may not even have been the person who chose them, but you&#39;re stuck with them, and then your boss asks you to implement a feature or fix something that relies on a change or fix in a dependency. Being blocked due to upstream intransigence is very frustrating, and there is often a professional cost to saying &#34;no&#34; to a request, especially a bug fix, no matter how convincing you argue that it&#39;s not your fault or under your control."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"As an OSS maintainer for a large project I disagree. Sometimes people did fuck off and it didn&#39;t do the project any favors.I needed people to communicate clearly and with volume why I should change some opinions. Ultimately, my mistakes led to a competitor that was indeed unsuccessful but sucked a lot of the mindshare so we both got screwed.We&#39;re smart people but we all need to learn humility occasionally. I do agree we need manners but I don&#39;t agree that people should just fuck off. I want complaints. That&#39;s how I can gauge improvement. A culture of ignoring complaints is bad. I know that is not what the article is about exactly, but it&#39;s where these things lead."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"There&#39;s (at least) four Fs, and the first in the list should be &#34;File it&#34;.Not every open source user is a developer who can Fix it or Fork it, but a well-written bug report (and other forms of high-quality feedback) is a godsend. Even as a developer, everybody benefits if I file a bug and then spend my energy on my own open-source work rather than spending that same amount of time trying to learn the codebase of every piece of software I use."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I don&#39;t quite understand the argument &#34;0-based being easier for pointer arithmetic is nonsense because the language doesn&#39;t have pointers&#34;.Whether or not the language presents the concept of &#34;pointer&#34; to the user is independent of whether or not it uses pointers internally. And if it exposes arrays as a concept, it has to implement them somehow.The simplest possible implementation of arrays is having a start address and putting all elements next to each other in RAM. To get the address of a particular item, this layout naturally leads to the formula &#34;base address + index * element size&#34;, with &#34;index&#34; being 0-based. If you want to expose other indexing schemes in your language, you&#39;ll have to add more logic to convert the user-visible index back to 0-based before you can obtain the address.All of this is completely independent of the fact whether your language exposes pointers to the user or not.Even the yacht story sort of hints at this:&gt; To keep people from having their jobs cut short by yacht-racing, Richards designed the language to compile as fast as possible. One optimization was setting arrays to start at 0.If all indexing schemes were equal, why would this change even be an optimisation in the first place?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Other advantages of zero based indexing, beyond being &#39;closer to the machine&#39;:It works better with the modulo operator: `array[i%length]` vs `array[(i+length-1)%length+1]`. Or you would have to define a modulo-like operator that maps ℕ to [1..n].It works better if you have a multi-dimensional index, for example the pixels in an image. With 0 based indexing, pixel `(x,y)` is at `array[x+widthy]`. With 1 based indexing it is at `array[x+width(y-1)]`. You might argue that programming languages should support multi-dimensional arrays, but you still need operations like resizing, views, etc."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Because otherwise you would be wasting a perfectly good number for no reason, which means you need to use more bits to do the same thing.To write 4 numbers (including zero) you only need two bits    0: 00
    1: 01
    2: 10
    3: 11

To write 4 numbers if you avoid using the number zero, you need three bits    1: 001
    2: 010
    3: 011
    4: 100

If you extrapolate that a little bit, you&#39;ll realize that you&#39;ll need two bytes (1 Byte + 1 bit from another byte) to store the indices of an array with 2^8 elements, which is just dumb.Some of you might be thinking: you don&#39;t need to store it the same way it&#39;s written, you can just substract 1 from whatever the user typed and convert it behind the scenes.Yes, you could subtract 1, but then you would be making the whole system more complex, opaque, and unelegant, while hiding information from the programmer for no good reason."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Think folks are missing the point here.The idea of this thread isn’t that bicycles are uniquely singled out for ridicule.These article snippets all come from a time when the bicycle was just invented and usage was growing fast (eg like any new tech). In fact, I think they were taken from a defunct Twitter account called pessimists archive.The point is that mass media will always court controversy and bemoan any new change in behavior regardless of what it is.Those headlines look silly now, but they are the Industrial Revolution’s version of “AI/smartphones/social media/video games/ridesharing/etc are ruining everything” articles."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;m not surprised in the slightest at these newspaper headlines in the linked tweets. They seem par for the course where I live.I sold my car at a profit two months ago and have been walking, cycling, and riding the bus where I need to go. Occasionally my trip calls for an Uber/Lyft. Wow, I have become a pariah in some people&#39;s eyes. People have made comments to my face about how it&#39;s odd I don&#39;t own a car and how it would be best that I get another. Someone scoffed when I answered their question of how I got to their place from mine when I told them I took the bus on a direct route.People do seem to be publicly supportive of me biking for short trips and for exercise, but they&#39;re mostly still in the phase of being introduced to the idea that someone could survive only biking. Biking as a primary form of transportation is still a foreign concept to them. I live in a very central part of the city, but this is a car dominated Texas city.Unfortunately, biking infrastructure and car etiquette is extremely poor around here. I find myself having to carefully choose my routes and am unable to reach certain places by bike that are quite close because it&#39;s not worth the risk. I hope cars begin to open more to the idea of bicyclists being around. A lot of great people I know have expressed negative sentiments towards bicyclists, so I have to believe there&#39;s a larger cultural issue at play."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"And somehow this translates to some drivers deciding that it is OK to kill cyclists because they will be 20 seconds late to the next red light stop."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"There needs to be an anti-patent-troll membership organization. You pay a fee relative to some metric and the organization acts as insurance against parent trolls by fully defending any patent lawsuits that are obviously unjustified. And to keep costs low, membership in this organization would be public to deter patent trolls from even trying to sue a member in the first place."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"If I was carefully looking for prior art to invalidate the patent, I&#39;d look at Verizon&#39;s patent portfolio:https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hum_(system)Their Hum product seems to do exactly what the patent troll claims to own a patent on.  It plugs into the OBD2 port and calls emergency services after a collision.Also, Nissan patented something very similar in 2004:US Patent for Vehicle emergency notification system and related method Patent (Patent # 7,323,972)https://patents.justia.com/patent/7323972"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"In every western country - except the US and England - the loser pays for the cost of the trial (all parties&#39; lawyer fees + the court).Just this reduces frivolous lawsuits. If you have a good case, sure, go ahead. If your case is weak, you run a real risk paying not only for your lawyers but the other side as well.(Note that there are disadvantages to loser-pays as well. Image you legitimately want to sue corporation X because they did something atrocious. Big corporation X can now run up lawyer cost that you have to pay if you lose.)Edit: Sorry I was wrong about England (which leaves the US only).
Edit 2: In the US you can file for your lawyer fees to be returned, but that in itself is risk (I have some lawyer friends)"</p>

I am NOT talking about the class of people who stake 32 eth to validate nodes.

The transition, known as The Merge,
    must first be activated on the Beacon Chain with the Bellatrix upgrade.
    After this, the proof-of-work chain will migrate to proof-of-stake upon
    hitting a specific Total Difficulty value.
  * The Bellatrix upgrade is scheduled for epoch 144896 on the Beacon Chain –
    11:34:47am UTC on Sept 6, 2022.
  * The Terminal Total Difficulty value triggering The Merge is
    58750000000000000000000, expected between Sept 10-20, 2022.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This doesn&#39;t surprise me and matches my own experience. Rust literally makes a codebase nearly void of most bug classes with the exception of logic bugs (Unfortunately, in a huge codebase, there can still be tons and tons of logic bugs).Still, when I migrated my Python codebase to Rust I got rid of whole classes of bugs and honestly code faster in Rust on a &#34;per debugged line of code&#34; basis. In Python, every line MUST be run or could trigger an exception (and so many do and it is hard to see). This now requires a test harness that tests every single line which is a huge pain. In Rust, the things that can obviously panic are pretty easy to see and are limited (unwrap, expect, indexing, etc.) making it much easier to write robust code, even with a more limited test suite."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; Dev velocity, which was supposed to be the claim to fame of Python, improved dramatically with Rust.I don&#39;t doubt this in the least. I&#39;ve been a professional Python developer for 15 years, and I can&#39;t believe Python ever had the reputation for &#34;high dev velocity&#34; beyond toy examples. In every real world code base I&#39;ve worked in, Python has been a strict liability and the promise that you can &#34;just rewrite the slow parts in C/C++/Numpy/etc&#34; has never held (you very often spend at least as much time marshaling the data to the target language format than you gain by processing in the faster language and you have all of the maintainability problems of C/C++/Numpy). Python trades developer velocity for poor runtime performance.I don&#39;t think Rust is the paragon of high dev velocity languages either, but it seems to be more predictable. You don&#39;t have something that works as a prototype, but then you run into a bunch of performance problems (which virtually cannot be worked around) when you go to productionize, nor do you get all of the emergent quality and maintainability issues that come about from a dynamic type system (and last I checked, Python&#39;s optional static type system was still pretty alpha-grade).I strongly recommend avoiding Python for new projects. Use Go if you&#39;re looking for an easy GC language with max productivity and a decent performance ceiling. Use Rust if you&#39;re writing really high performance or correctness-is-paramount software. I&#39;m sure there are other decent options as well (I&#39;ve heard generally good things about TypeScript, but I&#39;d be concerned about its performance even if it is better than Python)."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"So I was one of the 3 hackers who wrote the LSM that predated Rocks at FB, and as a result I distinctly remember when Rocks overtook it in features by trading off performance, and again when it met and exceeded the performance while keeping the greater capability. RocksDB kicks ass and has for a long time, I’d recommend it to anyone in the market for that sort of thing.FAISS is also great, and has been for years. I don’t doubt that someone has done a meaningful rev on it.But as someone who likes Rust and wants to like it more: don’t lead with that. The software speaks for itself. Or should."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"More details here:https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2022/08/code-speech-and-tornad...&gt; In keeping with our longstanding defense of the right to publish code, we are representing Professor Matthew Green, who teaches computer science at the Johns Hopkins Information Security Institute, including applied cryptography and anonymous cryptocurrencies. Part of his work involves studying and improving privacy-enhancing technologies, and teaching his students about mixers like Tornado Cash. The disappearance of Tornado Cash’s repository from GitHub created a gap in the available information on mixer technology, so Professor Green made a fork of the code, and posted the replica so it would be available for study. The First Amendment protects both GitHub’s right to host that code, and Professor Green’s right to publish (here republish) it on GitHub so he and others can use it for teaching, for further study, and for development of the technology."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Person that has worked on the defensive side of Money Laundering here.The Tornado Cash sanction has been fascinating to watch and my key takeaway has been that there are two camps: that TC is a Money Laundering service or a Privacy service. Both are talking past each other, when it can in fact be both. Each camp see the service as their primary concern and consider the other camp as an unintended secondary.I am seeing a lot of bad takes. &#34;Money laundering requires all three aspects&#34; particularly irks me because you can just point to KYC regulations to disprove that. 
&#34;Code is just code&#34; is another, but that is just because the code isn&#39;t why someone would be sanctioned or arrested. In the same way that The Pirate Bay was just code, its is how complicit they were in the offence that will get them.Ultimately, the dichotomy feels like a problem unique to public blockchains, and will only be solved with a ZK L1 chain, whatever that looks like. The solution would require the blockchain equivalent of end-to-end encryption, one where intermediaries have zero knowledge but doesn&#39;t require co-mingling of dirty and clean money.While I think money laundering is a more serious crime than piracy (at least the predicate offenses can be). Watch this play out like Megaupload, never ending legal issues for the first parties, and a technical solution like Mega."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Say what you will about the project and the space in general - the idea that any code licensed to you under an open source license can cause your derivative work to be subject to sanctions that were intended for the code’s original authors… would have a chilling effect on innovation."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I found the source article much more illuminating: https://lab.sciencemuseum.org.uk/colour-shape-using-computer...I don&#39;t find the headline graph that convincing. Firstly, it&#39;s only based on items in this museum&#39;s collection, which is quite a biased set as it says in the article.Secondly - if you actually look at the colour chart closely, you can see that although there is a trend of more grayscale objects in the collection, within the coloured section there&#39;s also a trend away from almost everything being some shade of yellow, orange or brown towards a much broader range of hues. Blues, greens and purples seem much better represented.It looks to me like ~70% of the colours were basically &#34;brown&#34; in the 1800s, and now ~40% are white/gray/black. Seems more a reflection of modern objects being made more out of metal and plastic and less out of wood than anything else. Again, this is putting aside the clear bias in the samples here.I&#39;m sure there are trends going on (and the car colour one seems legit to me) but I think this overblows it a little. Fashion ebbs and flows."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Commodification incentivizes regression to some mean.(rental) houses are losing color because they have to design it in the least offensive way. Better be &#34;acceptable&#34; for 1000 people than &#34;beautiful&#34; for 10.That mcDonalds is also a prime example. That building can be used for anything now. The old McDonald&#39;s building is specifically a McDonald&#39;s or some sort of &#34;fun&#34; eating establishment. If the McDonald&#39;s leaves the building, the &#34;boring&#34; one will be worth more/ can extract more rent."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I purchased a pink (well, metallic fuchsia) Jeep Wrangler this year, and reactions are wildly positive. I get compliments from random strangers at least once a week.I think people appreciate color, they just don&#39;t want to buy something that they perceive as harder to sell because of it. (Plus, of course, a couple buying a car may both like bright colors but like different bright colors.)Update: I should link to a piece I wrote about the Jeep and reactions to it, inspired by a Bob&#39;s Burgers episode.https://opposite-lock.com/topic/52688/tuscadero"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This is exactly what the engineers behind FoundationDB (FDB) wanted when they open sourced. For those who don&#39;t know, FDB provides a transactional (and distributed) ordered key-value store with a somewhat simple but very powerful API.Their vision was to build the hardest parts of building a database, such as transactions, fault-tolerance, high-availability, elastic scaling, etc. This would free users to build higher-level (Layers) APIs [1] / libraries [2] on top.The beauty of these layers is that you can basically remove doubt about the correctness of data once it leaves the layer. FoundationDB is one of the most (if not the) most tested [3] databases out there. I used it for over 4 years in high write / read production environments and never once did we second guess our decision.I could see this project renamed to simply &#34;fdb-sqlite-layer&#34;[1] https://github.com/FoundationDB/fdb-document-layer[2] https://github.com/FoundationDB/fdb-record-layer[3] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OJb8A6h9jQQ"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"People have been noticing this a lot recently but what nobody seems to know is that this is a form of money laundering/“scamming.” I know because I used to be active on crime forums and talked to some of the people who engineered this scheme.People will set up fake Spotify artist accounts with stolen identities and bank accounts, pay a musician for songs that pass as music, and then bot millions of streams on them. At this point there are so many of these fake profiles and songs that the music, which is simple “mood music” normally (which happens to be easy to make), is appearing on real playlists and being recommended to real listeners."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"In the “Release Radar” generated for me last week, there was a 40 second song consisting of rhythmic mechanical noises with a strange title and album art of an alien head. I didn’t like it at all. I think it was recommended to me because the publisher listed its artist as “Fanny Mendelssohn” — a classical composer whose work I definitely enjoy and have probably pressed “Like” a few times on — even though the song had nothing to do with her.You’d think, she shouldn’t be releasing any new works, you know, on account of being long-deceased and all. Therefore Spotify could block releases claiming her as an artist. Unfortunately, there are new renditions of her work being performed, recorded and published regularly, by many different groups. All of them have the right (perhaps even an ethical duty) to put Fanny Mendelssohn as one of the artists. These are works I’d like to hear, so Spotify’s recommendation algorithms are on the right track.How on earth can Spotify distinguish real Fanny from fake Fanny?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The post was interesting, but I also noticed something in the blog that had the same flavor.
Even though the link was for a specific post, the page layout neatly flowed into another post. So smooth I thought the second post&#39;s title was a subheading of the original article. A strange thing, but maybe that&#39;s just me making connections that aren&#39;t there."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Millenials and GenZ may have no idea who Mudge is. I, however, almost lost my first job out of college at a bank because I ran l0phtcrack against our Windows NT 4 server to see if it could crack passwords. I showed my boss, and he pulled me aside into another room and tore my head off for irresponsibly running this tool against a production server. He said I could have been fired if this got out, but he covered my ass, sent out an email requesting everyone reset their passwords, and let me continue working. I learned a good lesson because even though my intentions were good, and it did expose security issues, it was a bit immature and should have been done in a more controlled manner along with the proper clearances.Mudge knows the implications of &#34;whistleblowing&#34;. He has been a security consultant and even testified to Congress. He&#39;s not some noob that doesn&#39;t understand security or how systems work together to provide services like disclosure to FTC. The idea that Twitter PR can pooh-pooh away his concerns is shockingly stupid.I think Twitter is in real trouble here."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I learned a lot about Mudge by reading &#34;Cult of the Dead Cow: How the Original Hacking Supergroup Might Just Save the World.&#34;For anyone wanting to explore 90&#39;s security nostalgia, it&#39;s worth a read. For anyone wanting to learn where hacktivism comes from, it&#39;s worth a read. For anyone wanting to learn about how security consulting has evolved over the years, it&#39;s worth a read.Mudge is a very cool and capable individual. I am slightly surprised that Twitter would ignore someone of his talent and respect, and choose to air their dirty laundry in this manner. It&#39;s as if they have no idea who they hired. That, or C-levels think they can outpay $$$ any PR against Twitter to control the narrative. Either way, if Mudge is whistleblowing, there&#39;s probably some bad shit going down."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The whistleblowing case is a new dimension. To me as an outsider it implies Agrawal may have also been the manager in his previous technical role for a lot of the tech problems Zatko identified, and what made Agrawal CEO was his ability to leverage these problems to play ball with all the interests in that company and board, while sustaining through neglect some of those concerning practices within the organization. Twitter&#39;s product isn&#39;t technology, it&#39;s an uncertified  slot machine that pays out in political influence, and there are a lot of big interests depending on their cut of it. They needed a steady hand who wouldn&#39;t be vulnerable to being swayed by principle, and that&#39;s the one thing you don&#39;t keep hackers around for, imo.If I were betting, nothing is ever really systemically broken in large orgs, it just works for someone you can&#39;t see. This is a factor everywhere and not necessarily at Twitter. Shitty process? Cui bono. Unverifiable systems? Cui bono. Deniable and unaccounted-for access to God-mode data? Cui bono. Repudiable numbers reporting? Cui bono. Bizarre political posturing? Cui bono, etc."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I had some fun with StyleGAN a couple years ago.   I should probably have written this up, or something.  Some others I showed it too thought I should.  But I never took it too serious.  I was just bored over a couple weekends when I had access to some beefy GPUs.  And y&#39;know, it&#39;s quasi-porno.I opted for dudes not gals.  Part personal preference, partly because I happened to get my hands on an enormous dataset of hot shirtless guys taking selfies.The initial results were rather poor: https://i.imgur.com/npzDcCL.jpgThat&#39;s around when I realized how important the training data really is.  Too much variation in pose. So I trained a model that detected the face, nipples, and belly button, and aligned them vertically with that.  Then I briefly skimmed over the dataset manually, and deleted anything that just varied too much from the median, in a rather arbitrary way.Results were better: https://i.imgur.com/bS7ERC6.jpgSo I just let it churn away for a week, heating up the basement.  Some final results with narrow truncation and style transfer: https://i.imgur.com/rhnWnpK.jpgOne thing I find intriguing is how bland those men are, really.  Oh, beautiful, but too classically beautiful.  In a sense, StyleGAN is a compression algorithm, and highly truncated outputs are something like a median of the inputs.  So the above reflect a sort of &#34;average&#34; idealized image, that contains the traits most commonly found, in the media I trained it with."</p>

One REIT&#39;s pitch was that they owned such a large percentage of the rental housing in Tampa Florida, that even though vacancy rates were high, and rents were going down throughout the nation and other areas in the state of Florida, they were able to keep rents high in Tampa.Disgusted, I realized the harm that REITs and private equity are doing to housing markets, and wanted nothing to do with it.We need legislation that discourages housing as investment if we are to maintain  housing as shelter.

Here&#39;s a typical reply that I give to them:  I am philosophically opposed to &#34;investing&#34; in real estate, as your industry exists entirely to snatch up affordable housing from actual homeowners as a get-rich-quick scheme, benefiting those who are already rich at the expense of those who would otherwise be rising up out of their own financial situation.

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Key piece of information from the article:&gt; The CoreLogic data shows that what it calls “mega” investors, with a thousand or more homes, bought 3% of houses last year and in 2022, compared with about 1% in previous years, with the bulk of investor purchases made by smaller groups.So the mega investors only make up 3% of that 25%. I&#39;d love to see data on what the remaining 22% are, but my guess is:* flippers* middle class individuals buying a second property as an investment* small time property management firms run by local businessesAlso the Inside Economics podcast&#39;s recent episode Cooling Inflation and Confounding Housing Riddles[0] adds even more interesting color to the dialog. They explain that a lot of this is driven by demand for single-family home rentals. Roughly half of Americans will want/need to rent a single-family home at some point in their lives! Many people want to live in a home on a short-term basis, like when a family with kids moves to a new city and wants to familiarize with the area before committing to a full mortgage. And COVID combined with the changing demographics has caused a huge surge in demand, so surprise prices have also gone up.[0] https://moodys-talks-inside-economics.simplecast.com/episode..."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"As an EU citizen I didn&#39;t know exactly what that Chat Control thing was, so I web searched it:&gt; The EU wants to oblige providers to search all private chats, messages, and emails automatically for suspicious content – generally and indiscriminately. The stated aim: To prosecute child pornography. [1]Yeah, that will go down well, a central government checking our private conversations for &#34;suspicious content&#34;. Of course they would use the &#34;think of the children&#34; trope, they could also have gone with the &#34;think of the bad terrorists&#34; trope, but that would have been too American, too cowboy-ish, we need to feel special, we&#39;re Europeans, after all.Minus some street protests I don&#39;t think we can actually stop this, and, even then, I have my very big doubts. It so happens that I live in the EU periphery (I still need to present my ID card if I want to travel to Budapest or West from there), and it sickens me to see that my privacy depends on countries and electorates on which I have no say (like Germany, with all due respect to the Germans who still care about their privacy). Why should my privacy be made fun of because of decisions taken by some people from half way around the continent with which I have no direct connection and no shared past? Did they have a Securitate-like thing? Many of them didn&#39;t, and even those that did (like the same Germans), it looks like it doesn&#39;t matter at this point, they&#39;re all too happy to see their private political conversations be scrutinised 24/7.F. that, the only viable solution I see for my country is an exit from the EU, but the money (still) coming in from Bruxelles is too good to leave aside for pesky political principles, so of course that no serious politician from around these parts puts the problem that way.[1] https://www.patrick-breyer.de/en/posts/messaging-and-chat-co..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The only &#34;good&#34; thing is that the current German government is very skeptical about this and two of the current governing parties (the Greens and the liberal party) have also long been opposed to more surveillance.This was different with the previous government where the &#34;law &amp; order&#34; mentality was much more entrenched, and which did nothing to prevent e.g. upload filters (despite promising to do so).So I try to maintain some hope that at least Germany as a member state could tank this awful bill.edit:Here&#39;s the list of 61 questions that the German government sent to the EU concerning the bill (at the end of the article, in English): https://netzpolitik.org/2022/chatkontrolle-bundesregierung-l...From a cursory reading, it reads to me like the diplomatic equivalent of &#34;what you&#39;re proposing doesn&#39;t make any sense&#34;."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"It doesn&#39;t matter how low the error rate is. The fact that the European Commission wants to have a third (robotic) participant listening in on every digital communication is absolutely ridiculous.Saying that this is about child protection is a blatant lie. This serves only as a stepping stone to introduce other screening criteria later. And with opaque ML models it will be very tedious to determine what the model is supposed to find."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I&#39;ve been working 100% remotely for about 6.5 years now. Overall I love it.  However, there are very real drawbacks that have taken me awhile to fully realize.For me, the primary one is that it&#39;s _way_ too easy for everyone to get deeply frustrated with each other.  Social interactions and chit-chat lead to a better understanding of people and a more accurate mental model of what people actually mean when they say something.Written text is the majority of remote communication.  That&#39;s both good and bad. It&#39;s a much lower bandwidth form of communication than face-to-face in terms of being able to pick up intent and understand the context of someone&#39;s mood/etc in what they&#39;re saying.  The same goes of communication over webcam.  It&#39;s higher bandwidth than written text, but still lower than in-person.When you&#39;re fully remote, you&#39;ll much more commonly misinterpret folks intent. You&#39;ll also more commonly have your intent misinterpreted.At least in my experience, this tends to lead to a much higher rate of frustration and more frequent extreme misbehavior when everyone is remote.I don&#39;t have an easy solution.  Occasional in person meetings help a lot, but they&#39;re hard to do well, and easy to do poorly.  Having 200 people in the same room for 2 days doesn&#39;t really help the situation, as there&#39;s zero time to get to know anyone."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&#34;Your remote team is my company&#39;s opportunity.&#34;Purely anecdotal based on my own experience, but at my company we have some people who work in an office and lots more that work remotely.  The in office staff contribute more ideas, work, fixes, and functional software than the remote teams by a factor of 4 or 5, or sometimes, depending on the in office worker, 10 times.  Those are hard numbers right out of our project management system.  It&#39;s simply easier to hash out hard problems in person that it is on a remote team, and the context is key.  You have all the little asides, ah ha&#39;s! and comments collected up that provide a better picture than any remote team can get unless they have their headsets on the whole time.Not that you couldn&#39;t have a good remote team - I just think the methods of communication available are not best suited to our monkey brains.  We&#39;re social animal, and we work best socially.What this has allowed us to do is beat out other development teams, both inside and outside the company.  Hasn&#39;t gone unnoticed - we also get the most important projects and are paid the most.  When it matters, the in-house people get the work.YMMV, of course, this is just one place, but I think a lot of people who want to work at home aren&#39;t interested in their success as making their work life easier."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&#34;A study conducted on the main campus of a Fortune 500 company found that just 10 percent of all communications occurred between employees whose desks were more than 500 meters apart. This suggests that once companies span multiple floors, buildings, or campuses, they’ve already lost much of the collaborative value of being “in the office” together.&#34;This point often seems to get missed. If you&#39;re at a large company, you&#39;re often working with people on different floors, buildings, offices, countries. I want to be co-located with the people I work with often just isn&#39;t an option at larger companies even if many people come into an office."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This is why my old hosting company changed its auto disconnection code to work at 11am on a Monday morning, never at a weekend.That way it&#39;s the bill-payers that notice and get in touch, not the poor tech on the out-of-hours rota.Also, it only firewalled the customer&#39;s public IPs from the Internet - it didn&#39;t stop servers. That way when the account is settled there was often nothing for the techs to do.Also it was only ever done after the bank reconciliation was marked as complete, just in case...We relied on goodwill and recommendation of engineers for our growth, so were keen not to make their lives harder for someone else&#39;s bureaucratic (or cynical) mistake."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"A few years ago I was working at a startup and we had just started moving some stuff over from AWS to GCP. Things were going pretty good with GCP until one day they pulled the plug on everything with no explanation. It turns out that our company credit card details had been fraudulently used without our knowledge. The criminal had decided to use the card to buy Google Ad Words or something like that - this is the same card we use on our GCP billing account. Anyway Google just took prod down with no notice on grounds of fraud. Could happen to anyone."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"A suggestion for engineers that lack business experience. As soon as your project grows beyond the non-hobby scale and starts making real money, invest some time to reach out to company providing the services that keep it alive and find an account manager that will take care of you.We&#39;re a Google customer and of course we had our fair share of issues (btw: it&#39;s the same with Azure, based on our experience), and we always escalate to our account manager. That usually starts turning the wheels much faster.Also, do not be afraid to ask your account manager for additional discounts. Everybody in sales has some wiggle room to get you a better deal. With Google their account manager actually suggested that we work through a reseller and we&#39;re getting % off the list prices.Dealing with Google, Amazon, etc.. is not like dealing with code. It&#39;s not only transactional and you need to invest some time in the relationship even if you&#39;re the customer."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The most interesting part, to me, of a release like this is the amount of &#34;please don&#39;t abuse this technology&#34; pleading. No licence will ever stop people from doing things that the licence says they can&#39;t. There will always be someone who digs into the internals and makes a version that does not respect your hopes and dreams. It&#39;s going to be bad.As I see it, within a couple years this tech will be so widespread and ubiquitous that you can fully expect your asshole friends to grab a dozen photos of you from Facebook and then make a hyperrealistic pornographic image of you with a gorilla[0]. Pandora&#39;s box is open, and you cannot put the technology back once it&#39;s out there.You can&#39;t simply pass laws against it because every country has its own laws and people in other places will just do whatever it is you can&#39;t do here.And it&#39;s only going to get better/worse. Video will follow soon enough, as the tech improves. Politics will be influenced. You can&#39;t trust anything you see anymore (if you even could before, since Photoshop became readily available).Why bother asking people not to?

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Played with it for a bit in DreamStudio so I could control more of the settings.  So far everything it generates is &#34;high quality&#34;, but the AI seems to lack the creativity and breadth of understanding that DALL-E 2 has.  OpenAI&#39;s model is better at taking wildly differing concepts and figuring out creative ways to glue them together, even if the end result isn&#39;t perfect.  Stable Diffusion is very resistant to that, and errs towards the goal of making a high quality image.  If it doesn&#39;t understand the prompt, it&#39;ll pick and choose what parts of the prompt are easiest for it and generate fantastic looking results for those.  Which is both good and bad.For example, I asked it in various ways for a bison dressed as an astronaut.  The results varied from just photos of astronauts, to bisons on earth, to bisons on the moon.  The bison was always drawn hyper realistically, which is cool, but none of them were dressed as an astronaut.  DALLE on the other hand will try all kinds of different ways that a bison might be portrayed as an astronaut.  Some realistic, some more imaginative.  All of them generally trying to fulfill the prompt.  But many results will be crude and imperfect.I personally find DALLE to be more satisfying to play with right now, because of that creativity.  I&#39;m not necessarily looking for the highest quality results.  I just want interesting results that follow my prompt.  (And no, SD&#39;s Scale knob didn&#39;t seem to help me).  But there&#39;s also a place for SD&#39;s style if you just want really great looking, but generic stuff.That said, the current version of SD was explicitly finetuned on an &#34;aesthetically&#34; ranked dataset.  So these results aren&#39;t really surprising.  I&#39;m sure the next generations of SD will start knocking DALLE out of the park in both metrics.  And, of course, massive massive props to Stability.ai for releasing this incredible work as open source.  Imagine all the tinkering and evolving people are going to do on top of this work.  It&#39;s going to be incredible."</p>

that runs with local-only data (i.e. no internet access, no DRM, no weird API keys, etc like pretty much every AI-related application i&#39;ve seen recently) would be neat."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"FWIW, it is still possible to get TVs without this stuff, albeit at a premium. TVs are still made for business usage in areas like conference rooms, wall displays etc. They&#39;re often found under labeling like &#34;commercial digital signage&#34; or &#34;business display&#34; or the like, they seem to often try to avoid using &#34;TV&#34; (if being cynical maybe to make them harder for normal people to discover and confuse them if they do). But they&#39;re often nice panels aimed at serious running hours, without this sort of junk (which would give enterprise IT conniptions) and can have very useful feature support like 802.1x authentication which so many devices still lack. Players like NEC will even advertise their use of an RPi compute and wink at lack of spyware [0] for some of their products, but lots of major &#34;smart TV&#34; providers also have a commercial lineup.I think they&#39;re well worth considering, particularly for the HN crowd, granted I suppose for people who truly want built-in netflix or the like without connecting something like a Roku or Apple TV maybe it&#39;s less optimal. But even they might change their tunes back to the concept of separate boxes and normal panels if they dislike all the ads and data tracking.----0: https://www.sharpnecdisplays.us/products/displays/me501"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; Some may argue that there&#39;s no need to be dramatic and that there&#39;s nothing wrong in seeing an occasional ad every now and then.Oh, no, I am very dramatic about this. I will go to any lengths not to see advertising. I will entirely forgo any platform that shows me even one ad, especially when I pay them. Amazon Prime video is already pushing it with their preroll previews. The second it&#39;s something else I&#39;m canceling and going back to P2P. Fuck &#39;em."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"At home, I&#39;ve never connected my TV to my network.  The few firmware updates I&#39;ve needed to do were applied using a thumb drive, and I use an AppleTV as my interface.When I travel, I bring along an AppleTV and plug the HDMI port into their set.  This lets me keep the services I subscribe-to and use them with their display.  This has worked great until my most-recent rental, which had a RokuTV -- presumably setup on Wifi.When content was streaming from my AppleTV, Roku would overlay a panel along the bottom-part of the screen proposing that I can watch what I&#39;m currently watching from a variety of other providers.  This must mean that the TV set is analyzing the video or audio signal to fingerprint what the content contained, then matching it against a library of content to feed into its profile of my use.This is the first time I&#39;ve seen something like this.  I&#39;d always assumed that if you used the TV&#39;s UI and if it was connected to the internet, then you&#39;d probably be subject to their ads and data analysis, but it never crossed my mind that they&#39;d perform the same data-analysis over any signal passing through its silicon.Is this commonplace or is Roku the first of what&#39;s likely to be many doing the same?"</p>

This is important to me because of the non-annoying whoosh sound that the varied blade spacing of the OEM fans normally provide.

Firefox is so snappy, and at one point it was using less CPU than iTerm2. Mozilla has received a lot of crapped these past years, as did Firefox, but throughout my life this software has been free and open for me to use. I thank the contributors a lot for it."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"So, in a conventional reactor, you use nuclear fission to heat/pressurize water and then use your hot, slightly radioactive steam turn a turbine. This mostly works because moving even very hot, very high pressure water around is kind of a solved problem in industry.In a molten salt reactor, you use nuclear fission to melt various corrosive salts into a fluid, and this is good because molten salts store a lot more energy per unit (volume, presumably?) at low pressures, so you can transfer heat indirectly to nearby turbine-turning water without irradiating the water or relying on high-pressure water to cool your reactor. Cool.But I was under the impression that the main stumbling block for molten salt reactors was that high-energy corrosion resistant materials for containing / moving molten salt simply don&#39;t exist (yet). I suppose this is less of a problem for a research reactor, but it doesn&#39;t sound like there&#39;s been a materials breakthrough here that&#39;s allowing them to get started. Are they just plowing forward and they&#39;ll need to replace the containment infrastructure every few years?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Way, way overdue!  China has taken all of our research from the 50&#39;s and has been charging ahead.  Very sad that politics and ignorance has severely kneecapped our nuclear industry :("</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"A 1MW research reactor.Anyway, why is it always a fluoride salt? Is it because of the melting point or because of some nuclear property?I imagine there is some very relevant reason, because a less reactive anion (even chlorine) would be much easier to work with."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Damn, I had some fairly old opinion of Doctorow where I disliked him for some reason or other, but I am definitely revising that. I thought this was a great article.I am certain “bossware” will accelerate the downfall of already shitty workplaces.Very happy to hear Amazon is doing away with it. Strongly hope their workers unionize anyway. What kind of employer nickle-and-dimes a worker’s bathroom breaks? Not a good one, that’s for damn sure.I used to see these job postings on LinkedIn for Crossover for Work. I was intrigued by the claim of $400yr salary. Glad I didn’t end up working there. Thanks but no thanks, I am not going to work actively oppressing already downtrodden workers. A quick search turned up this fascinating article as well: https://medium.com/@whistler_12777/heres-why-crossover-is-a-...Fuck bossware. Fuck people who work to actively oppress others. Humanity for all, value of life for each and every person out there.Rant over. Thanks for the link."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"On workplace surveillance / &#34;bossware&#34;:&gt; Mazzoli seems to have either not used his product, or, if he did, did so under conditions where he was in charge of it – using it the way an athlete might use a stopwatch to time their own sprints, and not the way a boss might: to decide whether to dock your pay or fire you.&gt; This inability to understand the difference between using a technology and having the same technology used against you is endemic to the industry.I think this is a key failure of understanding for the &#34;tech is neither good nor bad!&#34; camp: just as the Death Star clearly was never going to be used for mining planetoids, it&#39;s very clear how workplace surveillance tech will be used to harm workers, if nothing else because of how it is currently being used. Continuing to work on such tech just because it could theoretically be used for non-evil purposes is morally bankrupt, and something the industry needs to establish ethical standards to prevent."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I’ve recently watched Brazil, and the film has one of the most chilling dystopian views I’ve ever seen because it’s easy to see yourself as part of the machine doing your best just trying to get by.Similarly, I can see how the people working in this software slipped into this- they identified a need in the market with WFH, tried prototypes that were well received on the market, and keep iterating. Many of them legitimately are interested in time tracking and optimization, but of course the market for personal tools like that is very small and lots of employers want to pay you for this because they want more productive employees. Meanwhile the people buying them don’t really know what they are buying, they want to believe they have found a solution to the problem they are terrified of, employees pretending to work and milking them. And the employees exposed to it aren’t in a position of power to change it. And next thing you know we have a dystopian monster with enough funding to be responsible for people’s jobs itself, where no one individual has incentives to buck the curve or much ability to fight back.What’s the solution then? Doctorow mentions unions, and I’d agree that could work. I think there must be another faction to join that doesn’t ruin you, something to compete with the monolith in case the monolith gets sick in this way. Being able to quit and find somewhere else only works if that somewhere else is mostly differentiated by the fact that it doesn’t do these programs you disagree with- many people will put up with this and worse if there is a large pay differential between it and the next option, or if they would have to move and uproot themselves. And if a government gets sick in this way it might not let you quit the country. You have to be able to form collective groups that can bargain with the behemoth, like a union, or political party, or other action that relies on people for it’s power and not capital. That’s one reason why money in politics is so worrying to me, because the way I see it, it messes with this crucial release valve of political action."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The killer application for these e-ink dispalys is calendar/todo list display. I&#39;d love to have my org-mode agenda and todo-list/notes on such a low-powered, low-refresh-rate e-ink screen.I know this question has been probably been asked many times, but I&#39;ll ask again: why are these devices not mass-produced in great numbers? Clearly there is great market demand for it, so then why would the market supply not respond to this demand? Is it because the technology has some oddities that manifest in tricky manufacturing processes? Or is it some patent encumbrance issue?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Somewhat unrelated, but I&#39;m still waiting for an affordable PC monitor based on e-ink technology. Dasung has been making some progress in the area but their products are quite expensive, around $1000 or more for anything with a useable size.
People might disagree on the count of lack of colors, but to me e-ink technology seems very well suited for writing code. And who knows, maybe in a decade or so the refresh rates for these color e-ink might be in a usable range as well."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"My ideal use case for this would be full size wall art. Similar to the Samsung TV that when off looks like art on a wall. Being able to have a new piece of art displayed daily along with as another commentator said your schedule. Wake up enjoy the new random art and see what your plans for the day are. Im sure the ability to scale this would be quite expensive. Buying many to connect and make your own custom size could work."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Great article. On the surface, it&#39;s about Snowflake. At a deeper level, the article is about the perverse incentives motivating SaaS businesses to do seemingly dumb, inefficient things and avoid seemingly obvious optimizations by default.Many SaaS businesses are perfectly happy to let customers shoot themselves in the foot if it generates more revenue. The BigQuery example (presently, by default, `select * from table limit 10` obediently scans the entire table at your expense!) is spot-on.As the article so well puts it, every SaaS company has a vested financial interest &#34;to leave optimization gremlins in.&#34;"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Snowflake is not expensive. Snowflake is super cheap, IF you know what it is for and how to use it. Compared to if you had to solve the problem on your own.The best way to describe Snowflake is that it is a brute force method to run complex queries without creating indexes.If you have a more traditional database, you will notice you need to set up indexes to be able to get anything from it in finite time. What if you don&#39;t know the indexes upfront? What if you want your users to be able to ask arbitrary queries and get answers before bedtime?That&#39;s what Snowflake is for. It automates using ENORMOUS amount of hardware to get your query executed fast, very inefficiently.It is not for free though. That inefficiency will cause a lot of resources used for queries. It is meant for those few queries when your users try to get some insight into your data and you can&#39;t predict indexes beforehand. Sometimes this is exactly what you want, like when you let your data people in to figure stuff out. Or when you have very rare functionality that allows the user to build their own queries -- which you should avoid like hell (and there are tricks to make it index pretty well) but can&#39;t always avoid.For everything else, whenever you can predict your indexes, you always want to use more traditional database that can be very efficient on queries properly supported by indexes.The issue is a lot of people try to use Snowflake as a database or to support frequently executing queries of the same kind. This is bad and it will cost you."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;m the author of the article. Didn&#39;t expect it to blow up. Let me clarify a few points:1. I like Snowflake and I think they brought several innovations to the field: Instant scale out/up, time-travel, unstructured data query support. 
2. Snowflake obviously makes innovations and performance improvements, otherwise they would not be the market leader they are. But I&#39;m also suspecting that they make just enough performance improvements to be at par and then use the vendor lock in features to make switching hard.My argument is that their rate of performance innovation has considerably gone down and DataBricks, Firebolt, and open source alternatives just seem more attractive from a cost/performance ratio. I agree that Snowflake is still the best data-warehouse to start with if you have 100k, but not if you truly plan for a multi-year horizon and your usage expands.- Redshift also brought a lot of innovation that allowed people to execute analytical queries 100x-1000x faster than any OLTP that existed out there. I&#39;ve used Redshift for four years and they kept ignoring performance and features until Snowflake came out. All of a sudden because of competitor pressure, they put more effort into the product to maintain and gain market share. My hope is that Snowflake finds a solution to their innovator&#39;s dilemma, since competitors are hot on their tails.- Some people point out that 70% usage growth just shows that Snowflake is useful. Nobody disagrees with that. The issue is that majority of the companies don&#39;t experience a 70% revenue growth to catch up with the growth in costs. At some point, you have to clamp down on costs, which means that you have to look for alternatives to run things more efficiently."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"When I went to college, having already done full-time software work and countless hours of programming in my spare time, I went to a departmental advisor confidently requesting to test out of the introductory CS classes aimed at first-time programmers. I nearly got laughed out of the room. I pushed the department on this, but it was clear: they simply did not do this. Everyone takes intro to CS. Everyone.It sucks, but there are people out there no smarter than you yet more powerful, and sometimes they impose a speed limit.If you get the opportunity though, I&#39;d still suggest doing what the author did. No harm in learning something twice, particularly from two different perspectives."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I read this article a while ago and recently re-listened to his interview on Tim Ferriss&#39; podcast: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnk4sgOFjBQ He talks about how maniacal he was at practicing music at a young age. His friends gave him a hard time because all he wanted to do was practice scales over and over. The dude was exceptionally motivated from a very early age.The gist of this blog post is that the average pace is for chumps and that he was able to finish Berkelee school of music in much less time than the average person takes thanks to studying ahead of time with a mentor and reading the books and testing out. He wasn&#39;t a &#39;chump&#39; and the lesson is that you shouldn&#39;t be either.I remember reading this advice 10 years ago and really taking it to heart. I didn&#39;t want to be a chump afterall and became convinced I could do everything faster than the chumps. But the problem with this is that it can make you beat yourself up and/or always feel rushed if it does take you a normal amount of time to do something. Like I&#39;ve had to admit that I&#39;m a really slow programmer. It took me forever to learn it. And I beat myself up a lot in the process.But now I&#39;ve taken to listening to more Alain de botton and Oliver Burkeman for my self-help/self-development. These British authors advocate for a much gentler version of self help. In one Alain de botton interview, he mentioned how we&#39;ve come to worship exceptionalism and see being average as being bad. Oliver Burkeman&#39;s 4000 weeks book plainly states that you can&#39;t do it all. This has been super refreshing for someone like me who took Sivers&#39; stuff seriously in my early 20s and then beat myself up for merely being average at many things."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is good advice to be taken sparingly. I went through the US Navy Nuclear program in which &#34;no speed limit&#34; was taken for granted. I never stopped operating that way until, one day, I had a mental health breakdown (I lasted about ten years). It took two years of therapy to deprogram that mentality from my mind.So yes, it can get you far, but there is a cost to be considered if you don&#39;t keep it under control."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I tried teaching high school CS for the best part of two years in a private school.  Everything to do with the pupils was amazing and I loved every moment.  I am a natural with behaviour management and although it was stressful, every time the bad kids acted up it presented a teachable moment.  You could really feel the impact on their lives and behaviour, well behind the Python and the TCP/IP and while loops.But everything to do with working with other teachers was utter misery.  Never have I met such a cantankerous downtrodden passive aggressive bunch of backstabbing political jobsworths.  Actually, it was probably only one third of the staff that were the hyper negative old timers, but they had such a dismal impact on me it felt like everyone was cut from the same cliquey snobby cloth.  Imagine the worst, most power hungry, little-napoleon office manager you’ve ever had and then imagine one in three of the staff have that mindset.It drove me mad and I’m now a SWE again but also volunteering at a youth center in our most deprived part of town and loving it.  I can have impact with the kids, and as a volunteer I seem to command much more respect from parents than a lowly teacher.So now I am tainted too — if I hear you are a teacher then I will see before me someone who at best tolerates that level of crappiness in their workplace, and at worst actively takes part in it.  Neither leave me with much respect for you, but I know why you do it: the kids."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I am an early-retired EE and I thought that I could have a second career in teaching HS physics.  I got the MA Teaching in Maryland, and did my one year student teaching assignment.  My thoughts:1. The degree program was decent, although a certificate program would be better for prior professionals if the law allowed it (lower cost, too much wasted time in redundant classes).2. Teachers are sad.  Very sad.  They are underpaid and overworked, even at the better suburban high schools.  Parents treat them poorly, even when they are veteran teachers with lots of experience.3. In general, the public resents that teachers get “3 months off” in the summer.  I believe that this is the justification for lower pay.  It is silly, because teachers work more in 9 months than most professionals and they also pay for things out of their own pockets.  They also counsel and tutor students after school.  It’s a difficult job.4. In my job interviews, the first and most important qualification was “classroom control.”  Math, science, engineering, life experience were all distant seconds.  Teachers—-even in advanced math and science classes—-are first and foremost caretakers.  Think about that for a second…5. What is the current model for education based on?  There are several competing historical arguments, but the salient factors like student-teacher ratio, subjects, grades, facilities, etc. are based on economics and legal requirements.  The quality of either a student’s experience or a teacher’s experience is not very high on the list.  Education is about checking a box on a list of requirements that was developed 150+ years ago.Ultimately, I decided to tutor rather than to teach in a classroom.  I consider this a personal disappointment, although I learned a lot from the educational experience.  I wish there could be a “town hall” type of discussion to consider ways to improve the situation."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Former HS math teacher here. It was the hardest job I’ve ever had. I still have nightmares about being back in the classroom 18 years later. I was easily working 12+ hours a day doing class planning, grading, etc. not to mention the actual teaching. Returning to programming my pay doubled and my stress level dropped profoundly. Teacher pay should easily be double what it is.(And about that summers off—with the exception of teachers who had non-teaching spouses or those in the back third of their career, everyone worked summer jobs to make ends meet.)"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Only using the official API is quite cumbersome, as fetching a story with comments requires one network request per each comment.Instead, try considering the (more unknown) Algolia API[0]. It supports fetching the entire tree in one request. Unfortunately the comments aren’t sorted, so you’ll still have to use the official one (or parse the HN HTML) if you need that.For my HN client[1], I parse the HN HTML (as it’s required for voting), and sort the comments from the Algolia API. It’s much faster than recursively requesting the official API.[0]: https://hn.algolia.com/api[1]: https://github.com/goranmoomin/HackerNews"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"In response to people&#39;s complaints about the usability of the HN Firebase API: yes. We&#39;re going to eventually have a new API that returns a simple JSON version of any HN URL. At that point we&#39;ll phase out the Firebase API, with a generous deprecation period. I&#39;d be curious to hear people&#39;s thoughts about what a generous deprecation period might be."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Wish API would show comment votes instead of only showing them up until 8 years ago when displaying them was turned off on the main site. Aside from allowing users to enable them via their on interface, do analysis, etc — it broke HN’s comment search based on comment popularity.Related:https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=32535637"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"To clarify what this means, since things can get confusing with subtle differences in wordings:* stage1 is when zig is built from C++ code[1] (the &#34;bootstrap&#34; compiler) using system C/C++ compiler toolchain.* stage2 is when zig is built from Zig code[2] using stage1.* stage3 is when zig is rebuilt from the same Zig code[2] using stage2.Before today, zig would give you stage1 by default, and you could opt in to stage2 using `-fno-stage1`.
After today, zig gives you stage3 by default, and you can opt in to stage1 using `-fstage1`.In all three cases, LLVM is being used. Although Zig has started to fully self-host by providing backends that have no dependency on LLVM, none of these fully self-hosted backends are complete.Why bother self-hosting? Because:* Zig produces smaller, faster binaries than C++ that use less memory[4]. Case in point: the new self-hosted compiler is 1.5x faster than the C++ implementation and uses 3x less peak RAM.* Development velocity in Zig is much faster than C++, and debugging is a breeze in comparison due to Zig being much safer than C++ and having better debug tooling. Similarly, comptime features let us add more assertions and debug checks that are not possible in C++.* Zig compiles much faster than C++.* Zig cross compiles better than C++ making it easier to create builds of the compiler for every target.* The self-hosted compiler does not need a softfloat library dependency to support f16 or f128 operations.* Zig&#39;s std lib data structures are incredibly useful, especially compared to the C++ STL.There are still many known bugs; not every project will be able to upgrade immediately. See the full upgrade guide [3] for help deciding when and how to upgrade.[1]: https://github.com/ziglang/zig/tree/master/src/stage1[2]: https://github.com/ziglang/zig/tree/master/src[3]: https://github.com/ziglang/zig/wiki/Self-Hosted-Compiler-Upg...[4]: https://media.handmade-seattle.com/practical-data-oriented-d..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; Memory usage is improved by a factor of about 3x. For Zig, building itself went from using 9.1 GiB to 2.7 GiB.Pretty impressive."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I never understood why &#34;self-hosting&#34; is considered a good thing.
Sure, the compiler developers can write in their favorite language and I guess it means the language is stable enough to be used in a complex project; however requiring an (older) compiler to build the compiler seems a significant complication for software distributions.You either have to set up an ever increasing chain of compilers, as the complexity of the language and the features required to build the compiler grows, or rely on pre-existing binaries. Either way, it seems like a nightmare compared to keeping it in plain old C and building with any compiler of your choice.
Just Imagine if any project did this, like, building Firefox now requires an existing Firefox installation."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I understand the problem here and I sympathize with professors in these circumstances. Learning the fundamentals will remain important. But as others have pointed out: if students are unwilling to learn, or are taking shortcuts, it will ultimately hurt them in the long run.One thing tho is that things like Copilot put the lie to the hypothesis (propagated mostly by the Google-style job interview) that intensely coding clever for-loops to perform algorithmic magic (for things usually already in the standard library) is the best measure of the competence of a software developer. If it can literally be done by a machine, maybe we should be measuring based on something else. Especially since this kind of thing is best done on the job by looking in a good textbook or using the standard library. Probably grading at the university level needs to consider this also.I haven&#39;t used Copilot. I doubt I&#39;m its intended audience. After 30 years, actually writing code is perhaps the easiest part of my job. The mechanics is the easy part. The big picture thinking and figuring how to get it all together into a system is the hard part (and honestly there are plenty of people far better at it than I am). Now, if we get a Copilot for that ... then our profession is in trouble."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"While it is true code pilot is quite amazing and can produce some very decent snippets, if the exercice you give is specific enought (using a special database schema, file format, or API), with objectives that are not common (ask the user specific questions, and draw conclusions out of it or react to events), then it cannot produce a fully working program. I use code pilot regularly now, and it does speed up my work, but I can&#39;t do anything with it without understanding the problem at hand.There is nothing wrong with the student assemblings and fixing parts of code that exist. Doing that requires understanding those parts, how they interacts and what you can do with them. It&#39;s not killing tests. Plus as professionals, we all do that anyway. Heck, I learned doing that. I&#39;m paid doing that.However, there is something wrong with academic exercices that I see in the wild. Things that are very abstracts, requiring way more than programming knowledge, or stuff that are asked out of context completely. Students are both understimulated, and given too hard bites to chew. It&#39;s a terrible way to learn, and to be tested IMO.Tests nowaday don&#39;t tests for knowledge, they test either for compliance, or act as a filter instead of a feedback loop. This is not education.In fact, I&#39;ve yet to see school IT course that I didn&#39;t find deeply flawed, and I completely understand the students for cheating at them to that they can suffer as little as possible. They are not given a chance to prove themself or progress, they are not respected. They are forced fed junk and asked to spit it back all shiny.I remember when I was a student, and I went to 11 different schools because of my twisted life. They all sucked. And I say that as I spent half my student life at the top of my class grade ladder.I regret having cheated so rarely now."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Cheating is getting easier by the day, but the bottom line is that if the student is cheating, they&#39;re probably not absorbing the coursework (or if they are cheating and absorbing the coursework, there might be something wrong with the coursework).The most effective policy might not be to try and mechanically prevent cheating, but to explain that, this is information that you&#39;re going to need if you actually want to go into the field and if you&#39;re using copilot here you are damaging yourself in the long run.Maybe it&#39;s not fair to give as good grades to students who are cheating on assignments as those who are actually doing the assignments, but at the end of the day is the purpose of the course to measure the student or to teach the student?"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The trouble with TDD is that quite often we don&#39;t really know how our programs are going to work when we start writing them, and often make design choices iteratively as we start to realize how our software should behave.This ultimately means, what most programmers intuitively know, that it&#39;s impossible to write adequate test coverage up front (since we don&#39;t even really know how we want the program to behave) or worse, test coverage gets in the way of the iterative design process. In theory TDD should work as part of that iterative design, but in practice it means a growing collection of broken tests and tests for parts of the program that end up being completely irrelevant.The obvious exception to this, where I still use TDD, is when implementing a well defined spec. Anytime you need to build a library to match an existing protocol, well documented api, or even an non-trivial mathematical function, TDD is a tremendous boon. But this is only because the program behavior is well defined.The times where I&#39;ve used TDD and it makes sense it&#39;s be a tremendous productivity increase. If you&#39;re implementing some standard you can basically write the tests to confirm you understand how the protocol/api/function works.Unfortunately most software is just not well defined up front."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"TDD use would be a lot different if people actually bothered to read the entirety of Kent Beck&#39;s _Test Driven Development: By Example_. It&#39;s a lot to ask, because it is such a terribly written book, but there is one particular sentence where Beck gives it away:&gt; This has happened to me several times while writing this book. I would get the code a bit twisted. “But I have to finish the book. The children are starving, and the bill collectors are pounding on the door.”Instead of realizing that Kent Beck stretched out an article-sized idea into an entire book, because he makes his money writing vague books on vague &#34;methodology&#34; that are really advertising brochures for his corporate training seminars, people actually took the thing seriously and legitimately believed that you (yes, you) should write all code that way.So a technique that is sometimes useful for refactoring and sometimes useful for writing new code got cargo-culted into a no-exceptions-this-is-how-you-must-do-all-your-work Law by people that don&#39;t really understand what they are doing anymore or why. Don&#39;t let the TDD zealots ruin TDD."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The main reason TDD hasn&#39;t caught on is there&#39;s no evidence it makes a big difference in the grand scheme of things. You can&#39;t operationalize it at scale either. There is no metric or objective test that you can run code through that will give you a number in [0, 1] that tells you the TDDness of the code. So if you decide to use TDD in your business, you can&#39;t tell the degree of compliance with the initiative or correlation with any business metrics you care about. The customers can&#39;t tell if the product was developed with TDD.Short of looking over every developer&#39;s shoulder, how do you actually know the extent to which TDD is being practiced as prescribed? (red, green, refactor) Code review? How do you validate your code reviewer&#39;s ability to identify TDD code? What if someone submits working tested code; but, you smell it&#39;s not TDD, what then? Tell them to pretend they didn&#39;t write it and start over with the correct process? What part of the development process to you start to practice it? Do you make the R&amp;D people do it? Do you make the prototypers do it? What if the prototype got shipped into production?Because of all this, even if the programmers really do write good TDD code, the business people still can&#39;t trust you, they still have to QA test all your stuff. Because they can&#39;t measure TDD, they have no idea when you are doing it. Maybe you did TDD for the last release; but, are starting to slip? Who knows, just QA the product anyways.I like his characterization of TDD as a technique. That&#39;s exactly what it is, a tool you use when the situation calls for it. It&#39;s a fantastic technique when you need it."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"One of the most interesting applications of ODEs (in my opinion) is the field of control theory, which empowers autonomous systems/robots/vehicles to guide themselves. Brian Douglas has some fantastic introductory videos on the subject [1].I don&#39;t think I agree completely with section 5 (Forget About Existence and Uniqueness of Solutions). For an ODE in the form xdot = f(t,x), existence and uniqueness on an interval follows if f is continuous in t and Lipschitz continuous in x [2]. This often isn&#39;t too difficult to demonstrate for a given system. In addition, if you can&#39;t prove uniqueness of solutions then you likely have to treat the system as a differential inclusion [3]. I personally find differential inclusions fascinating, but the math can be much more dense.[1]: https://engineeringmedia.com/videos[2]: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Picard%E2%80%93Lindel%C3%B6f...[3]: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_inclusion"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; 7. stay away from differentialsI always had issues with this. My undergraduate math classes were very formal and well thought, every object was defined, almost all theorems were proved in class.In particular, we were taught differential equations theories, some general theories like systems of differential equations with constant coefficients, Cauchy&#39;s theorem, and a bunch of recipes.In a separate class, we were also taught differential forms (e.g. a.dx + b.dy being a linear combination of base elements dx and dy - if I remember well).But then came the physics class, why we could go from dy/dx = f(x) to dy = f(x).dx and integrate both sides remain a mystery. &#34;dx&#34; suddenly became an infinitely small things, when it used to be a notation for a linear form OR a notation for f&#39;(x) === df/dx.Generally speaking, I had a lot of issues in physics because the maths used in that context were not formally defined and seemed to obey to some unwritten set of rules that you were supposed to find out by yourself during your final exam..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I find the following remark by Rota interesting:Insofar as the Laplace transform goes, two radically different uses of the word “function”
are dangerously confused with each other. The first is the ordinary notion of function as a
something that has a graph. The second is the radically different notion of function as density, whether mass density or probability density. For the sake of the argument, let us agree
to call this second kind of function “density function.” Professional mathematicians have
avoided facing up to density functions by a variety of escapes, such as Stieltjes integrals,
measures, etc. But the fact is that the current notation for density functions in physics and
engineering is provably superior, and we had better face up to it squarelyI&#39;ve suggested to mathematicians that the notation  ⌠             
  | f(x) dμ(x)
  ⌡             

in measure theory where μ is a measure should be replaced with  ⌠             
  | f(x)⋅μ(x) dx
  ⌡             

where the measure μ is treated as a density function. What I&#39;ve found is a mixture of either not understanding the logic, or the response &#34;What&#39;s the point?&#34; So it&#39;s interesting seeing Gian-Carlo Rota suggest the same idea AFAICT.As a bonus, the Radon-Nikodym &#34;derivative&#34; would be written as μ/λ instead of dμ/dλ. The RN derivative then doesn&#39;t appear like a derivative - it looks simply like division."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Shazam is one of the very few apps in the past 20 years that STILL &#34;wows&#34; me. I have no idea how the tech works, and I even sort of like not knowing, to be honest. It&#39;s one of the very few apps out there that still in exist in a &#34;magical&#34; way to me. I am constantly impressed with how fast/easy it works, even with very obscure music. What an amazing app.Fun quick related story, about 10 or more years ago there was a back tracking song on a TV show (Scrubs) that I really liked that was only in the Netflix version. It was just an instrumental song with some French sounding words speaking in it so there was no easy way to search for it. However, it was distinct enough that it didn&#39;t seem like something made just for the show. It was also pretty quiet and under some talking in the tv show scene. I had posted on reddit asking if anyone knew it, and never got any responses. I searched all over the web, but no source had the track details. It drove me crazy every time I would hear the song in re-watching the show, and I still could not track it down every few years when I tried again. Back then, Shazam had no cataloging of it so it wasn&#39;t in there either yet. However, when re-watching it a few years back again, I tried Shazam again and to my surprise it finally worked. I was blown away that Shazam was finally able to solve this 10+ year mystery. It was one of the coolest feelings every to scratch that itch finding this rare French song and hearing it in full. It was truly magical.EDIT: Oh sorry, I didn&#39;t think anyone would actually care about the song itself lol It was called &#34;Sans Hésitation&#34; by the French-Canadian band &#34;Chapeaumelon&#34;. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ju4d3YQhByU - It&#39;s also interesting cause now the song does in the episode in tv music database sites. Very cool."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I have a relevant story here. The inventor of the Shazam algorithm, Avery Wang, gave me a demo of it within a couple weeks of it being created. Here is the backstory (partly from personal knowledge, partly relayed by Avery).Avery had gotten his PhD from CCRMA at Stanford under Julius O Smith. His PhD had been on the topic of automatically (&#34;blind&#34;) recovery of individual vocal/instrument tracks from a final mix. From there he joined a startup, Chromatic Research, where I was also at. He created lots of code and patented some algorithms related to resampling and MIDI synthesis, stuff like that. Avery was (and is) a super nice guy, humble but incredibly smart -- he could work not only with the high level mathematics but was also equally excited to fine tune assembly code.After Chromatic folded, Avery had been struggling to get his own startup off the ground. About the same time, the Shazam guys had the idea for the product but didn&#39;t know how to create the algorithm. They approached Smith at CCRMA looking for someone capable of creating something that worked. Smith suggested they try Avery Wang.At first Avery said, &#34;Hmm, that seems difficult, but let me think about it.&#34; Within a week he had a demo running on a few thousand songs he had gathered from CDs. I&#39;m sure a lot of refinements went into it after that, but the core idea took him a weekend.[ All factual mistakes above are due to me and 20 year old memories -- if I misrepresented something it certainly wasn&#39;t due to Avery telling me something that wasn&#39;t true ]EDIT: A blurb about Avery
https://www.seti.org/avery-wang"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; August 2002: Shazam launches as a text message service based in the UK. At the time, users could identify songs by dialing “2580” on their phone and holding it up as a song played. They were then sent an SMS message telling them the song title and the name of the artist.Incredible! Curious to know what exactly happened backend after it listened to the audio, and what hardware it ran on."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I prefer the minimalism of a &#34;vertical rack&#34; which, for some reason, I tend to never see. If you don&#39;t have more than 6U or so of equipment, it&#39;s really the way to go because of its minimal profile and amazing load-bearing ability: it is load-bearing parallel to the direction of gravitational pull (vs regular rack cabinets where the load is perpendicular to the posts), and then that weight is all redirected towards the wall, so even the heaviest servers or whatnot that would normally sag unless it comes with rear-mountable rails for 4-post racks (which, for some reason, very few do) work amazingly well. I&#39;ve bought a few of this StarTech one [0] over the years, but I&#39;ve also seen people weld together a couple of metal struts to accomplish the same.[0]: https://amzn.to/3QTmVee"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I just opened one 2 weekends ago. I bought a kit (because of the really nice bottles), but then ignored the instructions and found significantly better recipes online. First time I&#39;ve fermented one, and it came out gloriously.I&#39;m proud of the result because it tastes nothing like other hot sauces I&#39;ve had (and there have been very many!), but also doesn&#39;t taste the least bit strange or out-of-place. I expected it to taste like Tabasco, but it came out more like Hunan because of a much darker flavour.I also make regular hot sauces with fruits and herbs that I forage from the neighbourhood. My current dipper is a slightly smokey medium heat made with morita, cascabel and guajira peppers, plum-like damson fruit and some wild mint that I lovingly call &#34;ditch-mint&#34; because that&#39;s where I found it. It would probably work fermented, but I&#39;ve only tried fermenting once so far.Once you get the connection with how certain ingredients alter the taste and texture when combined, you can pretty much wing it as you go. The more complex, the better. There is a balance, and you quickly learn flavourful vinegars / citrus, and sweeteners (brown sugar/honey/maple) will balance out just about any amount of spices and herbs. It&#39;s very rewarding if you like hot sauces, dips, marinades, etc, and the results will pretty much always make you feel like an old pro."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I started making fermented hot sauce during COVID in 2020. There&#39;s a fancy grocery store near me that sells scorpions, ghosts, and reapers, as well as burdock, tamarind, mango, etc. I usually fermented for a week, and I&#39;ve tried longer with little difference. I made an entire spreadsheet full of recipes that I tried, but ultimately I thought the fermented sour flavor overwhelmed everything. So, I started making them without fermenting, but with a little cooking to help break down some of the fruits and veggies and blend the flavors, and suddenly everything tasted 10x better. I was surprised, because for some reason I got it in my head that hot sauce must be fermented, when that&#39;s totally not true. Anyway, my $0.02 on fermenting hotsauce."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"A link to a great resource for learning about peppers and fermentation, replete with many good recipes: https://m.youtube.com/c/Chillichump (Chilli Chump)Edit for intriguing experiment of mine: I originally began experimenting with fermented chillis due to a suspected h-pylori infection. My reasons were a) h-pylori seems to swim away from capsaicin, possibly encouraging it to develop an excessive biofilm, thus contributing to its own isolation, b) capsaicin, despite its apparent burning effect, can be helpful with ulcers due in part to encouraging healthy mucous formation and c) the lactobacillus and other probiotic factors involved. I believe this was critical in abolishing a rather nasty ulcer that nearly debilitated me."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Thanks for the nice comments, everyone! I made this but didn&#39;t expect to see it here.As people have noticed, the spinning diagrams are done with CSS, which was fun.Basically it&#39;s just an `animation: linear infinite;` from `transform: rotateY(0turn);` to `transform: rotateY(1turn);`(source here https://github.com/hrldcpr/poole/blob/master/_sass/_latex3d.... )To keep the numbers facing forward, they&#39;re all also rotating, but in the opposite direction :pAnd all of the numbers&#39; `translate3d(...)` coordinates are generated by a Python script because I didn&#39;t want to do that by hand..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is delightful! I believe these sums-of-powers formulas can be derived fairly easily with discrete calculus techniques (it&#39;s in Knuth&#39;s Concrete Mathematics, IIRC), but to see a purely geometric approach succeed is fascinating.To understand why this technique works with sums of arbitrary powers, the key is to show that summing together rotations of simplices gets you a simplex of constant values. The following geometric argument works:1. Think of the numbers in the simplex as a function f(x) of the coordinate vector x for the space the simplex is embedded in. Observe that f is linear.2. A linear function on a simplex is determined uniquely by the values it takes at the vertices. Specifically, the value at any point is a weighted average of vertex point values.3. If we create a &#34;sum simplex&#34; by summing together all possible rotations of the simplex, the result will also be a linear function on a simplex, and the values at all the vertices will be the same by symmetry.4. Therefore, the linear function giving the values of the sum simplex is constant.A rigorous proof could be developed by considering the standard simplex generated by the coordinate unit vectors, but scaled by a factor of n. For example, the equilateral triangle is the 2D simplex generated by connecting the vertices at (n,0,0), (0,n,0), (0,0,n). On this simplex, the integral points (x,y,z), where the coordinates x,y,z are integers, are the points assigned numbers in the blog post. &#34;Rotations&#34; are done by switching coordinate axes (actually a reflection), which preserves the integral points."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The importance of this subject is underestimated and applies as well quite independently of whether humans eat the insects directly or not. Consider the cuban tree frog for example, which has long since initiated its campaign in Florida to host and spread throughout the food chain the rat lungworm nematode. Rat lungworm (angiostrongylus) holds its own in the burgeoning presence of hideous and hostile parasites. It is highly infectious to many species and no picky eater, as it favors the entire body of the host, the brain and all. Burmese pythons are another up and coming host in Florida, and while they might prefer a provincial life in the everglades, many other species will meander north and onward. There are other nasties from nematodes to cestodes and more, gaining new ground. Baylisascaris procyonis is another terrible nematode found almost anywhere in the US, mostly in racoons, but in other species (humans included) with more varying and less frequency and it&#39;s often incurable. A study showed that, if I remember correctly, 40 out of 250 wildlife rehabilitation personnel had been exposed, but symptoms varied by exposure load. Both rat lungworm and baylis ascaris are resistant to environmental elements that normally break things down, with baylis even surviving UV light, formaldehyde and extreme cold. Rat lungworm can be deposited on surfaces (eg vegetables),  and snails are common vectors. Lungworm is very difficult to remove by washing while baylis is so adhesive that wildlife control authorities advise disposing of rather than washing shovels or tools exposed to racoon latrines. The list goes merrily along with other nasties, but it would require time to refresh my memory and accurately describe more."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Larger animals can be inspected individually to find pathogens or diseases.Insects are so small that it&#39;s practically impossible to inspect each individual organism. You can do sampling of the batch, but the odds of missing bad ones are still high.Same with the fruits and vegetables, some are easy to inspect, others are almost impossible, or impossible to clean. There are kosher (insect-free) versions of lettuce and some berries which are much more expensive than non-kosher ones.Lastly, disgust is a part of the human immune system. Religious dietary laws and cultural taboos are probably partly developed from disgust, and partly from trial-and-error."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I’ve wondered about this for a few years so this is extremely gratifying to read. I’ll have to go in deeper later to really understand the implications of each parasite, but my main takeaway is that my intuition here was way off. I expected insects to pose far fewer risks from parasites to humans.I wouldn’t have taken a chance based on that assumption, and cooking bugs seems like it would eliminate most of these pathogens, but still. I figured it would be safer.I’d need to read a lot more to draw some kind of comparison between insects and animal agriculture (both seem to carry plenty of baggage), but it’s great to see research like this so it’s possible to begin doing so."</p>
